Mold taxi driver finds 4ft snake in cab

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taxi driver from Flintshire has described her shock after discovering a hidden passenger in her cab -  a 4ft (1.2m) snake.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Madge Allen, of Stanways Private Hire in Mold, found the adult corn snake under her seat after dropping three passengers off at Flint train station.
The 67-year-old said it had escaped from one of the passengers' bags.
"I have been a taxi driver for 28 years and have driven cats and dogs but never a snake. That's a first," she said.
Colleagues thought it was a joke at first, but after realising it was real they called a snake handler.
"I have a fear of snakes so good job it was sleeping. Goodness knows what could have happened if I'd seen it while driving," said Ms Allen.
"I've had plenty of banter from the other drivers about it now."
The passenger contacted the firm but has not collected the snake, which is now being looked after by a friend of Ms Allen's colleague.
