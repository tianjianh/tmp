[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unite union general secretary Len McCluskey is due to meet with the company's executives over growing concerns the plant will not be financially viable in three years.
The site, which employs about 1,850 people, will stop making the Jaguar and Ford Sigma engines in 2019.
Ford will cut production of new petrol engines and investment at the plant.
The American car firm said it did not plan job losses and still had a "substantial commitment" to the factory.
Unite union said it was "deeply concerning".
