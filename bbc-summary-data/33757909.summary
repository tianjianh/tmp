The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted assaulting and robbing the two 14-year-olds in Northfield in Birmingham in July.
A judge at Birmingham Youth Court told her she had carried out "horrendous acts of bullying".
The video was viewed 11 million times.
The court heard the girl hit one of her victims in the face with a handbag and grabbed the other by the neck, pushing her to the ground.
Amar Sanghar, prosecuting, said the girl stole cash and a mobile phone and "went on to humiliate" one of her victims "by demanding that she take off her shoes and socks".
When admitting assault and robbery, the teenager told police she could not remember anything about the incident, which happened at about 22:00 BST on 13 July, because she had "downed a bottle of vodka" in the hours beforehand.
District Judge David Robinson passed an order for the girl to be referred to a panel to supervise her behaviour over the next ten months.
He said he did not believe the girl's story that she was too drunk to remember the assault.
"I've seen the video and it's clear you knew exactly what you were doing and why you were doing it," he said.
However, he avoided sending her to immediate detention, pointing out she was of previous good character and that the incident was a "one-off".
The teenager's solicitor, Amy Nuttall said, the girl had received "thousands of death threats" after her identity was shared online.
Speaking outside court, Ms Nuttall said: "My client wishes to apologise publicly for her actions which were completely out of character."
Reading a written statement from the girl, she said: "This is the first time I have been in any trouble with the police.
"I am ashamed of the way I acted that night and deeply regret the whole incident."
The girl, who has left school, said she was "disgusted" with herself after being shown a video of what happened.
The court had previously heard two groups of youngsters had clashed on the night of the attack.
The teenager then accused two girls in the other group "of giving her a dirty look".
She forced the first girl to get on her hands and knees to apologise and hit her in the face with a handbag before turning on a second victim.
The teenager then went through the victim's bag, stole her phone and purse and told her she would "beat her up if she grassed".
