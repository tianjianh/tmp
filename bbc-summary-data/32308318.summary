Oklahoma 'Taser error' officer turns himself in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A white officer who killed a black man after apparently mistakenly grabbing his gun instead of his Taser has turned himself in to police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Bates, 73, has been charged with manslaughter for killing Eric Harris, 44, during a sting operation over gun sales in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
His lawyer said the charges were "unwarranted" as he and Mr Bates left the police station.
His client was released on a $25,000 (Â£16,900) bond.
Mr Bates served as a reserve deputy in Tulsa County Sheriff's office, a volunteer position, since 2008.
He is also chief executive of an insurance firm and a major donor to the Sheriff's office.
The manslaughter charge carries a prison sentence of up to four years if Mr Bates is convicted.
A video of the 2 April incident, released at the request of the victim's family, shows Mr Harris being chased and brought to ground before he is shot.
A gunshot is heard and a man says, "Oh, I shot him. I'm sorry."
Mr Harris is heard calling out "He shot me, oh my God!"
He later died in hospital.
It was the second time in a week a videotaped fatal shooting of a black man has provoked an outcry.
Last week Walter Scott, an unarmed 50-year-old, was shot in the back and killed in South Carolina.
The protests that followed that incident continued months of demonstrations about police use of force, ever since a black unarmed teenager was shot dead in Ferguson, Missouri, last summer.
