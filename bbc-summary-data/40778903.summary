The woman's car collided with an oncoming lorry on the A361 near Barnstaple in Devon at 08:25 BST.

The family is believed to have been on holiday in Devon from the Milton Keynes area. The road has now reopened.
More on the crash and other news
Insp Richard McLellan said: "It would seem that a car travelling towards Barnstaple, for unknown reasons at the moment, has crossed the centre white line and hit an oncoming truck.
"Unfortunately the family were travelling in two separate cars but travelling together along this road so dad was there at the scene as well."
Three ambulances, five rapid response vehicles and the air ambulance attended the scene near Barnstaple.
Devon and Cornwall Police said two children and a woman, believed to be their mother, had died as a result of the crash.
The children's stepfather was travelling in a vehicle in front and saw the crash happen.
An investigation is under way and police have asked for witnesses to come forward.
A woman and two children are in hospital after a crash on the same stretch of the North Devon Link Road on Sunday.
