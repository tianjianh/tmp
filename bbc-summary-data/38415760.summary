The 23-year-old former England Under-21 international decided to switch allegiances to DR Congo in March but is yet to make his debut for them.
He qualifies to play for the Leopards through his parents.
Afobe is one of eight England-based players in coach Florent Ibenge's 31-man squad.
Other stars from England includes Newcastle defender Chancel Mbemba, Hull City striker Dieumerci Mbokani, Gabriel Zakuani of Northampton Town, Norwich City's Youssouf Mulumbu, Birmingam City midfielder Jacques Maghoma, Charlton's Jordan Botaka and Neeskens Kebano of Fulham.
Everton winger Yannick Bolasie has been omitted following his recent knee injury that required an operation.
Hervé Kage, who plays for Belgian side Kortrijk, is excited with the prospect of playing in his second Nations Cup after helping his country to a third place finish in Equatorial Guinea last year.
"I'm very happy with the call-up and I hope to be in the final list to enable me give everything to make the country proud," Kage said.
