Substitute Chris Martin grabbed the crucial winner with just two minutes to play, and it was the least the Scots deserved.
On a night when several men in dark blue stood out, former Scotland striker Billy Dodds gives his marks out of 10 for Gordon Strachan's side.
Very little to do but one crucial save at his near post in the first half. A typical Craig Gordon performance.
Didn't look out of position at right-back and settled into the role immediately. Didn't get forward as much as he does for Celtic but another impressive performance from the teenager.
The Norwich defender was not asked too many questions but showed great concentration levels throughout. Unlucky not to score with a shot from a corner in the first minute.
Exactly the same as his centre back colleague. Never looked ruffled and handled what little came his way with ease.
A man-of-the-match performance. Outstanding for the full 90 minutes, showing immense energy levels and qualities in attack and defence throughout the game.
A typical Scott Brown performance. the captain was a real powerhouse in the Scotland midfield, proving once again that he can still compete at international level. He was involved in a few feisty tussles, with his opponents coming off second best.
Flitted in and out of the game but when on the ball his distribution was effective.
One of the all-time best debuts in a Scotland jersey. Carried on his club form for Celtic into the international arena. A certain starter against England.
Grew into the game after a quiet start. Had some decent driving runs but was subjected some heavy tackles from the Slovenia defence.
Not his best performance in a Scotland jersey. Great cross in for Griffiths in the first half but didn't create enough.
Hit the crossbar with a left-foot volley when he should have found the back of the net. Also hit the post with a crisp right foot shot. Worked hard but had to be replaced early in the second half after taking a knock in the back.
Put himself about a bit without causing Slovenia too many problems.
Should have scored within a minute of coming on for Snodgrass but certainly helped put the visitors on the back foot in the closing minutes.
Jeered on but cheered off after scoring the goal that keeps Scotland's hopes of reaching Russia next year alive. He showed a real strong mentality to turn the Tartan Army his way.
