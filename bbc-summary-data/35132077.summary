The album, which tackles race relations in post-Ferguson America, topped a "poll of polls" compiled by the BBC.

Folk-rock artist Father John Misty's I Love You, Honeybear came third.
Jamie xx's In Colour and psychedelic rock band Tame Impala with Currents made up the top five with Adele's 25 - the year's best-selling record - in 12th place.

There was a huge diversity in the critics' picks, with 140 albums cited across the 20 polls surveyed by the BBC.
But Kendrick Lamar's 11-time Grammy nominated album was the only one to feature in every list - taking the number one position 10 times.
"Lamar, the scene's latest true superstar, has emerged as the one to beat," wrote The Sun.
"His sense of timing is impeccable," added Billboard. "In the midst of rampant cases of police brutality and racial tension across America... the politically charged project sonically commands your full attention."
