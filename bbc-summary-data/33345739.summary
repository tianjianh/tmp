The 81-year-old, who has Alzheimer's, will continued to be monitored by doctors, his agent said, but is "as well as can be expected".
Police spent Tuesday searching for Noakes after being alerted by his wife, Vicky, at about 09:00 local time.
He was spotted by a helicopter nearly 10 hours later close to his home.
His wife said search parties had looked in the area where he was eventually discovered earlier in the day but failed to spot him because he was "in the bottom of a storm drain and had fallen in amongst long grass there".
The TV presenter was taken to hospital, where he will stay for the next two to three days because of his age and dehydration caused by the hot weather, thought to be around 35C (95F).
"I would like to say that the emergency services have been really excellent and pulled out all the stops, and they were greatly helped by our friends and local people," she said.
Noakes worked on Blue Peter for 12 years from 1966 to 1978 and remains one of its best-loved presenters.
He moved to Majorca with his wife in the 1980s, after a round-the-world yacht trip was cut short by a giant wave, which badly damaged their boat off the coast of North Africa.
They had embarked on the trip after Noakes quit Blue Peter in 1978, and Go With Noakes 18 months later.
Noakes, who trained as an aircraft engine fitter before training as an actor, was 31 when he made his first appearance on BBC One's Blue Peter.
