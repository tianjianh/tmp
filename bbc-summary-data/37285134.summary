An app to support those at risk of suicide in the north east of Scotland has been accessed by more than 6,000 people in the six months since it launched, BBC Scotland has learned.

National body Choose Life is behind "Prevent Suicide - Northeast Scotland" and an accompanying website.
The technology is aimed at being a stepping stone to specialised support.
More than 60 people took their own life in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire last year.
Local Choose Life coordinator Iain Murray said: "Not everyone accesses the services that they perhaps need.
"The app, for me, bridges that gap.
"You can take a bit of personal responsibility and that's where you can start to build your own plan.
"It gives you that first step."
In January, it was warned that the growing numbers of job cuts in the oil industry was having a dangerous impact on the mental health of some workers.
