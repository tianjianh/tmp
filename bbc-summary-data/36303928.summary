Cameron-row council cuts children's centres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Conservative council at the centre of a cuts row involving the prime minister has announced it will close more than half its children's centres.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Twenty-six of Oxfordshire's 44 centres are set to close despite the plans previously being shelved.
David Cameron wrote to the authority last year expressing "disappointment" at cuts to various services.
His mother, Mary, then reportedly signed a petition opposing cuts to children's centres.
The council announced that from spring 2017 there will be 18 centres, with eight providing childcare services. Currently there are 44 children's centres and seven intervention hubs.
Child services bosses blamed government cuts and claimed "financial pressures" and rising demand meant the structure of the service had to be reviewed.
Cabinet member for children, education and families Melinda Tilley said: "I have no choice but to save the money, the government has stopped the money.
"We cannot continue as we are... and that's something I find doesn't seem to get through.
"When you take Â£6m out of services it's going to have consequences."
Save Oxfordshire's Children's Centres has called the proposals an "unforgivable waste of money", claiming cash is being "funnelled" into intervention hubs for vulnerable children rather than to children's centres.
Campaigner Jill Huish said: "It's our young families and children that are going to get cheated.
"What's happening is they're taking money away from prevention and putting it into cure. It's basically plugging one hole to create another.
"That hole is going to mean families falling through the gaps; it means some children will be invisible [to services]."
The council said 30 extra staff will be drafted in to the remaining 18 locations to help identify vulnerable children.
Mrs Tilley added: "What we are proposing is the safest possible system that protects vulnerable families and links effectively with other agencies.
"Our priority is keeping children safe and supporting the most vulnerable families."
The authority has said it is also providing Â£1m to help communities take on the running of current children's centres post-2017.
The full council will consider the new proposals on 24 May.
