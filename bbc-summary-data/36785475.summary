Arco said it had submitted a planning application to build a second distribution centre costing £25m at its site on Henry Boot Way.
It would "enable the organisation to double its output", the company said.
The firm makes gear including protective suits used by medical teams dealing with Ebola in West Africa.
Neil Jowsey, joint managing director of Arco, said the proposed 20,439m sq building would "house both additional warehouse and logistics capabilities" and "could create over 200 potential new jobs in the local area".
"We are working with local architects and experts to design and construct a building that will complement the surrounding area and provide a sustainable, high-tech facility to enable us to grow our business and provide a secure future", he added.
