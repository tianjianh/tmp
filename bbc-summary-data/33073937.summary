Bannaras Hussain, 35, of Bridge Close, Goole, faces 22 offences against girls under 16 spanning four years between 1998 and 2002.
His brother Sageer Hussain, 29, of the same address, has been summoned to court in July for four counts of rape in 2003 of a girl under 16.
Bannaras Hussain is due before Rotherham magistrates on Wednesday.
South Yorkshire Police said the charges were the result of Operation Clover, a joint investigation in partnership with Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
Bannaras Hussain faces charges including three counts of rape, four counts of aiding and abetting rape, nine counts of indecent assault, two counts of assault and four counts of procuring a woman for prostitution.
Senior Investigating Officer Martin Tate said: "This is a complex and protracted investigation with a vast amount of work still to do.
"Eleven other men remain on bail in connection with this investigation.
"I want to continue to encourage victims of all sexual crime to come forward."
