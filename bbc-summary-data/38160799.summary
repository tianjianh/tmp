[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tiny primary school with just 15 students could be closed and the children moved to a new school five miles (8km) away.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The future of Horton-in-Ribblesdale Primary School, in North Yorkshire, is to be discussed by senior councillors.
The school had no new entrants this year and has no headteacher but was rated outstanding by Ofsted in 2010.
One parent opposed to the possible closure said: "It's a hub of the village."
Jonty Rhodes, who has a child at the school, added: "The school's key to this community, there isn't a deal else important in Horton-in-Ribblesdale now."
North Yorkshire County Council's Executive is to consider publishing closure proposals at a meeting on 6 December.
The school cannot provide "the social and educational breadth and quality that children require and will struggle to be financially sustainable", said the council.
Of the 15 pupils there is only one child in nursery, one child in Key Stage 1 and only two boys in the school.
If closure notices are published there will be a consultation period and a final assessment in January would decide if the school is to close in April.
