The son of a 73-year-old Denbigh man who is missing on Crete has suggested "foul play" could be to blame for his disappearance.

Arthur Jones has not been seen since 19 June - two days after he arrived, and at a news conference, son Jeff made a tearful appeal for his safe return.
Mr Jones also criticised the way Greek police were carrying out the investigation.
His father was due to fly home on 24 June but was not on the flight.
A vigil was held in the pensioner's home town on Thursday evening.
He had sent his family a postcard saying he was planning a walking trip but those who have flown to Crete found Mr Jones's equipment still in his room in Chania.
His son told reporters: "We just wish we had a North Wales Police officer team here with us to help.
"There was mass overgrowth at the hotel where he was staying in, but the police have only searched the perimeter and not even with search dogs.
"The longer it goes on and the lack of things we see happening, we all think, or suspect - is there foul play?"
He added: "Since we arrived, although we have been assisting the police with their inquiries, we almost feel that we have been leading the investigation - every snippet of information that we can give them," he said.
Family members and friends on Crete have handed out 1,000 leaflets on the island, hoping British tourists will remember bumping into the pensioner.
But Mr Jones said not one witness had come forward.
"It's all very, very strange," he added.
He is due to meet the consul, Beverley Lewis, later on Friday.
Arthur Jones is described as 5'6" tall, medium build with short grey hair and a grey moustache.
A Facebook campaign to Find Arthur has attracted support from over 3,000 people.
Prime Minister David Cameron has also pledged to do "everything he can" to help find Mr Jones.
