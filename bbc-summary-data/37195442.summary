Sterry, 20, came through the academy at his hometown club to make his first-team bow against Tottenham in the Premier League at the end of last term.
The right-back follows Freddie Woodman, Rolando Aarons and Adam Armstrong in agreeing a new contract.
"This week has been really good for me," Sterry told the club website.
"I've worked really hard to get here. I've learnt a lot, especially under the manager [Rafael Benitez] but also under every coach and every manager."
