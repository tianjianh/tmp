[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two-day RMT strike begins on ScotRail

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the RMT union at ScotRail have started another two-day strike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A number of services have been cancelled and others will run less frequently. Further strikes will take place later this week.
The RMT is campaigning against the increased use of trains without guards, with the driver opening and closing the doors at stations.
Such operations are already common on the ScotRail network, particularly on suburban rail lines.
ScotRail has insisted that it would always ensure a second member of staff was onboard every train to assist the driver in emergencies.
The union believes the absence of a dedicated guard would make trains less safe.
