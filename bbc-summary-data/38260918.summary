Darren Burnett lost his semi-final 21-20 to Ryan Bester of Canada, the man he beat to win Commonwealth Games gold at Glasgow 2014.
The men's fours (Ronnie Duncan, Iain McLean, Paul Foster & Alex Marshall) were well beaten by New Zealand.
Lesley Doig and Lauren Baillie lost out to Welsh duo Laura Daniels and Jess Sims in their pairs semi-final.
Doig won silver in the singles event last weekend, with Foster and Marshall also taking bronze in the men's pairs.
Meanwhile, England's Sophie Tolchard and Ellen Falkner also secured a bronze medal after beating Kelsey Cottrell and Karen Murphy of Australia 17-12 in the elimination round of the women's pairs.
