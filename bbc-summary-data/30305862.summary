Was Ed Sheeran's Victoria's Secret gig his toughest ever?

Let's all just take a moment and celebrate Ed Sheeran.

Weeks after he did his bit for Band Aid 30, the singer has donated his time for another good cause, the UK's first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.
For hours the poor guy was surrounded by arguably some of the world's most beautiful women modelling lingerie.
He was granted a few minutes of respite to sing on stage, but even then Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio insisted on distracting him as they walked past.
We blame those noisy stilettos.
Speaking ahead of the show in London, Ed said: "It's weird, it's one of the only times I have ever played where the attention isn't on the musicians."
To add insult to injury, the 23-year-old was also forced on to the stage at Earls Court Exhibition Centre surrounded by an army of underwear models and sandwiched between Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande.
It is selfless people like you Ed, that keep this country ticking. For that, we thank you.
Those pink, fluffy, angel wings may look all saintly, but we bet Ariana Grande doesn't think so after one nearly caused carnage during her performance.
Model Elsa Hosk must have not seen the petite pop star and nearly knocked her over with her wing. Luckily Ariana noticed and ducked just in time.
It is just as well because Ariana has some seriously loyal fans, including a group who camped outside the hotel where she was staying in London.
To warm them up, the 21-year-old sent them signed cups filled with hot chocolate.
Poor Ed may have been suffering, but at least his mate Taylor Swift seemed to enjoy herself.
At one point, she even walked the runway with model Karlie Kloss - who, judging by this photo, is a bit of a fan.
