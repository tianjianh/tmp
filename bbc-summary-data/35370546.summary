City councillors granted outline planning permission for shops, restaurants, cafes, a leisure centre and a new bus station.
There were 250 letters of objection, mainly about the effect on the traffic in the city centre.
Twenty five councillors were for, 13 were against and there was one abstention.
Developers TIAA Henderson Real Estate and The Crown Estate say the revamped site, due to open in 2019, will create 750 jobs.

Some people were turned away from the extraordinary planning meeting of the city council as there was not enough space for all those who turned up.
Residents were worried about air pollution and traffic congestion, because of roads being closed as part of the plans, diverting traffic elsewhere.
There have also been concerns that the bus station will not be big enough.
Councillor Andrew Leadbetter, leader of the Conservative group on the council, said: "I'm disappointed because we believe that the development lacks ambition and is also very expensive. It's going to cost the city close to £30m which means that other things can't go ahead."
Council leader Pete Edwards, from the Labour group, said: "I'm really excited, not just for ourselves but for the citizens of Exeter.
"It's sad to see some of the opposition so vehemently against it when it's a great opportunity to go forward."
John Grinnell, deputy head of development at The Crown Estate said he was "delighted".
"This scheme would represent a substantial investment in Exeter that will support the city's position as the region's most popular destination for shopping, leisure and business, whilst boosting jobs, trade and the local economy," he said.
