The authority said it was investigating how many duplicate bills had been sent out.

Geoff Brown, the council's Cabinet member for Communities, said: "We will continue to liaise with the company over this error but in the meantime please be reassured that residents and businesses are only being billed once, so please ignore any duplicate bills received."
