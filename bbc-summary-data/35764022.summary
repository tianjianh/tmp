Wolves kicked a drop-ball from close to their own box out for a throw-in deep inside the visitors' half after an injury to City midfielder Luke Freeman.
The throw-in led to a free-kick for the hosts, which Matt Doherty headed in.
"I'm an angry man at the moment if I'm honest, for a number of reasons," Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"A big club like this, you don't expect a historic club to have to resort to unsporting behaviour.
"The lad said he was going to kick it back to the goalkeeper and he smashes it out right in our corner and puts us under pressure."
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett responded: "He (Johnson) was unhappy on the sidelines definitely. I wasn't quite sure what the expectation was.
"The ball went out for a throw-in quite deep. It is splitting hairs really."
The defeat left Bristol City 20th in the Championship table, two points above the relegation zone, while Wolves moved up to 12th.
"I thought we were the side that was looking like we was going to go on and win it," Johnson added.
"We were in the ascendancy, and that incident changed the ascendancy from us having it to them having it through, in my opinion, unsporting behaviour."
