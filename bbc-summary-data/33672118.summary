The 25-year-old lost his place towards the end of last season to David Ospina, before the Gunners signed Chelsea keeper Petr Cech last month.
Poland international Szczesny has made 180 appearances for Arsenal after joining their youth ranks in 2006 from Legia Warsaw.
"I believe he will have a future at Arsenal," said boss Arsene Wenger.
"I rate him highly. I put him in the first team at the age of 20 and he already has huge experience.
"Roma is a big club, they play in the Champions League, play in a very different championship and that is a big experience for him."
Szczesny played in 17 Premier League games last season and his last appearance for the Gunners was in the 4-0 FA Cup final win against Aston Villa in May.
"I had a difficult time last year - I'm the first person to admit that," he said.
"I didn't have the best of seasons, that's why things have turned out the way they have, but I'm grateful because it gives me the opportunity to join Roma this season.
"If I work hard - and with the help of the coaches - I'll be able to help the team improve from last season and hopefully challenge for the title."
