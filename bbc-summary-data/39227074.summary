[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 4-0 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tammy Abraham scored his 22nd goal of the season as struggling Bristol City stunned Huddersfield Town to dent the Terriers' automatic promotion hopes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Tomlin rounded Danny Ward to slot City ahead, after Town's Jonathan Hogg was taken off on a stretcher following a 14-minute stoppage.
Chelsea loanee Abraham made it 2-0 on the stroke of half-time, before Aden Flint superbly flicked in City's third.
David Cotterill's penalty, after Joe Bryan was fouled, sealed victory.
Lee Johnson's side, who had won only twice in 22 league matches prior to beating Wigan Athletic last Saturday, have now recorded back-to-back successes for the first time since 1 October and move up to 19th in the table.
Huddersfield had won eight of their previous 10 Championship games to keep up the pressure on the top two, but remain six points adrift of second-placed Brighton after coming up against a Bristol City side in inspired form.
David Wagner's team struggled to impose their familiar high-tempo, high-pressing game on the Robins, and never really recovered after Hogg had to be withdrawn in the first half following a clash with team-mate Mark Hudson.
The 28-year-old received lengthy treatment to his neck and back from both sets of medical staff before being stretchered off to applause from all four sides of Ashton Gate.
He was understood to be conscious and talking in the dressing room before being taken to hospital for a scan.
Tomlin's composed finish deservedly put City in front, and 19-year-old Abraham doubled the advantage after displaying brilliant movement and striker's instinct to stab home at the near post.
Centre-half Flint, who struck the winner at Wigan, made it 3-0 with a brilliant between-the-legs flick before Cotterill's penalty into the top corner lifted Lee Johnson's side back out of the relegation zone.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "As far as my players are concerned, I was delighted with every one of them. They carried out our game plan perfectly and it was great to produce such a terrific performance in front of our own fans.
"I hope we silenced a few doubters tonight. I saw this display coming and was confident before the game. Now we go into the international break with real momentum."
On father and Cheltenham Town manager Gary Johnson, who underwent heart surgery on Thursday: "This result will be a massive tonic for dad and I want to thank the football world for all the goodwill expressed towards him and our family.
"The heart surgery was performed by Joe Bryan's dad, which we didn't want to talk about before the game.
"I am grateful to him and all the hospital staff. Dad is doing okay and the test results are encouraging.
Huddersfield Town head coach David Wagner: "Bristol City were strong and we under-performed. I have never spoken about automatic promotion and we now need to use the international break to refresh and respond to this result.
"We are in a very good position with nine games to go and we have been through too much together as a group for me to question my players."
