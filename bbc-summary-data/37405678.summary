Sunken boats are being removed from the River Hull in an attempt to reduce the risk of flooding.

The River Hull Board said around 20 sunken vessels were restricting the flow of the river.
The removals are part of a Â£45m package of works over the next five years to manage the flood risk in the River Hull valley.
The river runs for more than 20 miles (32 km) from the Yorkshire Wolds to the Humber Estuary.

Conservative MP Graham Stuart, chairman of the River Hull Board, said the removals "will help reduce the risk of catastrophic flooding for local homes and businesses".
He said: "Clearing the riverbed of sunken boats is part of the multi-million-pound plan to speed the flow of water down the river, which could make all the difference the next time there is very heavy rainfall."
In 2007, heavy rainfall caused Hull and the surrounding area to flood damaging thousands of properties.
