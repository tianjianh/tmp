Giro d'Italia: Gianluca Brambilla maintains overall lead after time trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italy's Gianluca Brambilla has held on to the leader's jersey by one second as Primoz Roglic won a rain-affected stage nine time trial in the Giro d'Italia.

Etixx-Quick Step rider Brambilla saw his overall 23-second lead almost wiped out by team-mate Bob Jungels.
Roglic's victory was aided by heavy rain that affected later starters on the 40.5km route from Radda to Greve.
The Slovenian (LottoNL) clocked 51 minutes 45 seconds - 10 secs ahead of Matthias Brandle (IAM Cycling).
Braendle's team-mate Vegard Stake Laengen was third and former four-time world time-trial champion Fabian Cancellara (Trek) fourth.
Brambilla - who finished 17th in the stage, 2mins 5secs behind Roglic - told Eurosport: "It was wet and slippery but I had to give it a go. The pink jersey is still mine - only just - but it's still mine."
Earlier in the day, Germany's Marcel Kittel, who led the Giro after back-to-back stage wins in the Netherlands, retired from the race.
Kittel made his decision after finishing 18 minutes behind team-mate Brambilla, Saturday's stage eight winner.
The tenth stage, which will happen on Tuesday after a rest day, will take the riders on a mountainous 216km route from Campi Bisenzio to Sestola.
The Giro - the first of the three Grand Tours in the year, before the Tour de France and the Vuelta a Espana - finishes in Torino on 29 May.
