Harry Potter creator JK Rowling will publish another crime novel this summer, the second to be written under her pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Published on 19 June, The Silkworm will again feature Cormoran Strike, the private detective Rowling introduced in 2013's The Cuckoo's Calling.
The author's pseudonym was unmasked last year after the information was leaked by a member of her legal team.
The new novel sees Strike on the trail of a novelist's murderer.
Along with his assistant Robin Ellacott, he will probe the death of a writer whose latest manuscript would have ruined several lives had it been published.
It has also been announced that Rowling will discuss her new career as a crime writer at a literary festival in North Yorkshire.
The 48-year-old will appear in conversation with Val McDermid at Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival in Harrogate on 18 July.
Writing last year, Rowling said that 'Robert' "fully intends to keep writing" but would "probably continue to turn down personal appearances".
