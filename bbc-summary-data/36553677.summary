Equalities Secretary Angela Constance said the money would be distributed between 224 projects across Scotland.
More than £3m will go towards large organisations such as the Equality Network, Inclusion Scotland and the Scottish Refugee Council.
The LGBTI helpline and Muslim Women's Resource Centre are among 80 projects to benefit from a pot of £6.5m.
Referring to the recent homophobic terror attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, in which 49 people died, Ms Constance said: "This week we saw the worst targeted attack on LGBTI people that we have seen in the western world in recent times.
"Scotland has made some great progress on LGBTI rights and we are considered one of the most progressive countries in Europe in terms of LGBTI equality."
She added: "But we are not complacent - we recognise there is still work to do to eradicate prejudice and discrimination against LGBTI people.
"We are allocating over £850,000 from this budget to organisations and projects that are working towards this aim."
The Scottish government has also committed to funding of £11.8m to address violence against women and girls, with £3.5m of this to go to projects providing frontline services to victims.
Ms Constance added: "Equality is part of the aspiration and ambition we have for Scotland.
"No-one should be treated unfairly, suffer injustice or be denied opportunities because of their age, disability, gender, gender identity, race, religion or sexual orientation.
"Amongst the 224 projects receiving funding support this year are frontline services which are working directly with communities to address local issues."
