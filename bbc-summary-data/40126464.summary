HMT Sancta Maria plans to relocate from Uplands to a new 18-bed hospital planned for land between Fabian Way and Prince of Wales dock.
It will form part of the plot occupied by University of Wales Trinity Saint David's (UWTSD's).
Once open in 2019, the two organisations will work together to develop training and skills.
Sancta Maria is owned and operated by not-for-profit Healthcare Management Trust and provides private as well as NHS treatments.
HMT Sancta Maria's Hospital director, Stuart Hammond, said the new hospital would allow it to provide a wider range of treatments and services.
UWTSD's Vice Chancellor, Prof Medwin Hughes, said it would help drive its healthcare learning courses, especially in elderly care.
