Trump last week beat Hilary Clinton to become the 45th US president after a campaign in which some of his policies proved controversial.
"I'm not going to stand for something I don't believe in," said Evans, 23.
Earlier this season, dozens of players knelt during the anthem to protest against racial inequality.
That movement was started by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he received death threats.
Wide receiver Evans sat on the bench alone while his team-mates stood as the Star Spangled Banner was played before Tampa Bay's 36-10 win over Chicago Bears.
Evans said Trump's election showed "America's not right, right now".
He added: "When he ran, I thought it was a joke and the joke continues.
"I'm not a political person that much, but I got common sense. And I know when something's not right.
"When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we've been Punk'd, then I'll stand again. But I won't stand anymore."
During his campaign, Republican Trump said he would ban Muslims from entering the US and would build a wall across the US-Mexixo border.
Video footage also emerged of the 70-year-old making offensive remarks about women.
In a statement, the Buccaneers said they encourage members to "respectfully honour our flag", adding: "We also recognise every individual's constitutional right to freedom of speech, which is crucial to the American principles we cherish."
