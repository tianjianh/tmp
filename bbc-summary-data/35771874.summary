Mental health services to help women during and after birth have received a £1.5m boost from the Welsh Government.

Thirty specialist staff will be appointed across Wales to look after women with prenatal and postnatal mental health illnesses.
Community-based teams will include doctors, nursing staff and other healthcare professionals.
Mind Cymru said around 30% of parents suffer anxiety or depression in the first year after their baby's birth.
The funding announcement comes as a conference on developing perinatal mental health services was being held in Cardiff.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "It's vital that we support mental wellbeing before, during and after pregnancy and support women who are at high risk of developing mental health problems as close to their homes as is practical and safe for both mother and baby.
"We want mothers and their families to have a positive experience so they can feel confident, capable and well-supported during pregnancy and the first weeks and months of bringing their new baby into the world."
