Brian Smith: Wakefield appoint ex-Hull FC & Bradford coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Super League's bottom club Wakefield have appointed experienced Australian Brian Smith as their new coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Smith, 61, will be working for a fourth time in England, having previously been in charge at Hull (1988-1990) and Bradford Bulls (1996), as well as working at national side level.
He also coached at Illawarra Steelers, St George Dragons, Parramatta Eels, Newcastle Knights, and Sydney Roosters.
He replaces James Webster, who left the club earlier this month.
Webster took over at Belle Vue last June following Richard Agar's exit. But he parted company with Wakefield following the Challenge Cup defeat by Championship leaders Leigh.
Smith, the brother of Warrington coach Tony Smith, will come to Belle Vue subject to being granted a working visa.
He plans to fly over later this week, which means interim head coach Stuart Dickens will remain in charge for next Sunday's game at home to Leeds.
Wakefield chairman Michael Carter told Sky Sports: "Brian Smith is a worldwide name in rugby league and he comes with the highest pedigree. It is a real coup for a club like Wakefield to attract someone of his ilk.
"He sent a text message through our former coach James Webster, who passed that on to me.
"I had a couple of chats with Brian over the phone and he spoke well about what he wanted to achieve.
"We had a really high calibre of candidates but having spoken to Brian it was an easy decision to make."
