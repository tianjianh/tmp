The Channel Islands Co-op has won approval for a 91-bed budget hotel and new supermarket at Charing Cross.

Revised plans were submitted after Jersey's planning authority rejected an earlier proposal in August 2013.
Co-op management said the Â£12m scheme will be a major boost to tourism and a gateway to the centre of town.
After a campaign to save six listed buildings, the Co-op gave four to the Jersey National Trust.
Colin McLeod, Channel Island Co-op chief executive, said he was "relieved".
"People who have followed the Charing Cross story - or tome - will have seen the very difficult competing demands on that site.
"To deliver a solution that's based on consensus with planning officers and the National Trust emphasises the lengths we have gone to."
