[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jersey man jailed for sharing indecent images of children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man described as a "prolific supplier" of indecent images of children has been sentenced to eight years in prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Godson, 49, from St Ouen in Jersey, admitted 24 counts of inciting, taking and making the images.
Godson, originally from Canada, was sentenced on Monday at Jersey's Royal Court.
The court heard that he possessed more than 68,000 indecent images and hundreds of hours of video.
Det Insp Paul Kennea, of the States of Jersey Police, said: "Jonathan Godson was a prolific supplier of indecent images of children and it is likely this behaviour would have continued if he was not caught.
"He not only downloaded indecent images of children, but actively shared them with others, thus encouraging further offending, and further adding to the suffering of victims.
"He possessed thousands of images of children and hours of video and is clearly a danger to young people."
