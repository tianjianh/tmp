[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Reverend James Percival, 64, of Holy Trinity Church in Freckleton, and daughter Ruth, 28, were also arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to conceal the birth of a child.
His wife Susan, 65, was also arrested on suspicion of concealing a birth.
Lancashire Police said three people have been bailed until 5 March. A post-mortem examination was inconclusive.
A police spokesman said: "The 64-year-old man and 28-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of murder and conspiracy to conceal the birth of a child and the 65-year-old woman arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to conceal the birth of a child have all been bailed until 5 March 2015."
Further tests to establish how the baby died will be carried out.
Police arrested the vicar and his daughter on Tuesday after reports of a woman giving birth to a stillborn baby boy on 25 November.
