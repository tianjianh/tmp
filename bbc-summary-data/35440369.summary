Daily and Sunday Politics manifesto tracker: Education

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welcome to the Daily and Sunday Politics manifesto tracker. As the name suggests, it tracks the progress the government is making  - or not - in achieving the promises made by the Conservatives in their 2015 general election manifesto and major policy announcements.

The tracker has been broken down into policy areas, which can be explored by clicking on each of the links below.
