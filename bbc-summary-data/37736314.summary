Barnsley 2-2 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adam Hammill's last-minute strike rescued a point for Barnsley at home to play-off hopefuls Bristol City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marley Watkins headed the Tykes into an early lead, before Sam Winnall's penalty, after he was fouled by Scott Golbourne, was saved by Frank Fielding.
Lee Tomlin equalised from the spot following Adam Jackson's handball, and Tammy Abraham slotted his 12th goal of the season to put City in front.
But Hammill's curling injury-time effort denied the visitors victory.
The 28-year-old former Wolves and Huddersfield winger, who had been linked with a move to Ashton Gate during the summer, had only been introduced from the bench in the final quarter of an hour.
His late equaliser was no more than Barnsley deserved, after they had mustered 20 shots at goal and struck the post through Adam Armstrong's 25-yard strike.
Yet the Robins looked to be heading for another remarkable comeback victory when 19-year-old loanee Abraham steered home a 12th goal of the season, having already overturned deficits to win four times in 2016-17.
Lee Johnson's side remain sixth in the Championship table, while Barnsley are 12th.
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom:
"It would have been a travesty if we hadn't got anything out of it, but when you've been behind and you score a late goal, you're satisfied with a point.
"The game could have been easy for us and then you're 2-1 down and you're scrambling to get a point and we managed to do it.
"The character of the lads is fantastic and, from the first minute to the last, they were great. Even in the build-up, helping Josh Kay through his debut."
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"It was a rollercoaster for me, that's for sure. I'm disappointed to have not got the three points, but in fairness on the balance of play, a draw was probably a fair result.
"I have to look from the technical side of how we went from a throw-in in the top left-hand corner, with three minutes to go, to conceding 25 seconds later.
"It was end to end with lots of incidents. I thought the referee liked the sound of his own whistle in the first half. That was driving me a bit mad."
