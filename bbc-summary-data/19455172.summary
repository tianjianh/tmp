[SN]TITLE[SN]
European Warrant issued over Ealing 'sex abuse' priest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have obtained a European Arrest Warrant for a former Catholic priest accused of past sex offences, who failed to answer bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In June 2010, a man now in his 40s, made an allegation of sexual assault at St Benedict's School in Ealing, west London.
The wanted man has been named by police as Lawrence Soper, 68.
Police believe he may be in Italy and are appealing to the public to notify them of his whereabouts.
Mr Soper was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in September 2010.
He was bailed to return to a west London police station in March last year but failed to appear, said police.
A European Arrest Warrant requires member states of the European Union to arrest and surrender a suspect for prosecution.
