The new Star Trek TV series is to centre on a female character, the show's executive producer has revealed.

Bryan Fuller said Star Trek Discovery will feature about seven lead roles, but will focus on a female lieutenant commander instead of the captain.
According to Deadline, it is thought the lead character will not be white in an effort to increase diversity.
Fuller also said the new show, which will air next year, will feature a gay character in the ensemble.
It is not the first time a Star Trek series has had a female lead - Kate Mulgrew played Captain Kathryn Janeway on Star Trek: Voyager, which ran from 1995 to 2001.
Speaking at the Television Critics Association panel for US network CBS, Fuller - who has also written the pilot episode - described the lead in Star Trek Discovery as a "lieutenant commander with caveats".
He said he decided not to focus on the captain because "we've seen six series from captain's point of view and to see one from another point of view gives us a richer context".
The other details Fuller revealed about the series included:
The new series, which begins production in two months, will be streamed globally on Netflix the day after it is made available on CBS All Access in North America from January.
