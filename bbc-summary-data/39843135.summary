[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trains into Cardiff from Barry and Penarth are now running normally after an earlier points failure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Services were cancelled or delayed on Monday morning after the problem occurred between Dingle Road and Cardiff Central.
Replacement buses were laid on while the line was closed and Cardiff Bus was accepting train tickets via reasonable routes.
Network Rail apologised to "anyone who was late as a result".
Andy Thomas, route managing director at Network Rail, said: "This morning a crucial set of points, which allow trains to cross from one track to another, failed between Dingle Road and Cardiff Central stations.
"Most trains that run on the Vale of Glamorgan line require the use of these points.
"Working with our partners Arriva Trains Wales, we have done all we can to keep passengers moving and get normal services up and running again as swiftly as possible.
"Our people got to the site quickly to fix the problem to minimise the impact on customers.
"We'd like to apologise to anyone who was late as a result of the delays and disruption this morning."
Some passengers had reported being stuck on trains for more than an hour, with some taking to social media about their delays.
Arriva advised passengers to retain tickets in case they were entitled to compensation.
