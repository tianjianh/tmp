The 23-year-old Hughes won his first Scotland cap last summer and is, along with 25-year-old Bulumakau, a member of the Scotland Sevens squad.
Hughes has made nine appearances this season and Bulumakau four.
"It's a boost for the club that they will be with us again next season," said head coach Gregor Townsend.
Glasgow-born Hughes joined Warriors from Stirling County in 2013 while Bulumakau, who moved to Scotland from Fiji aged 10, signed last year from the British Army.
"Rory has really progressed over the last 12 months and his hard-working approach has enabled him to play in a number of important games for the club and win a cap for Scotland," added Townsend.
"There is much more to come from him and we are going to have some excellent competition for places on the wings next season.
"Junior came in earlier this season and made some very good contributions during the Rugby World Cup period, with the Munster game being a particular highlight.
"This was Junior's first season as a full professional and he's learned a lot about what it takes to succeed at this level.
"We're looking forward to him using this experience to improve even further next season."
