[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 0-1 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A gritty win at Southport ended Chester's six-match winless run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blues made the early running as Evan Horwood found Tom Shaw with a cute pass and the midfielder struck the post.
Most of the first-half efforts were restricted to long range, and Shaw also tested the grip on Magnus Norman's gloves.
It looked like stalemate was setting in as the second half progressed, but Chester goalkeeper Alex Lynch picked out Horwood with a long kick and the defender lobbed Norman brilliantly to put the visitors ahead.
The Sandgrounders roared back strongly, but were desperately unlucky as Liam Hynes and Jim Stevenson both struck the woodwork.
