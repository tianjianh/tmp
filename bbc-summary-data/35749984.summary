[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wolfsburg reached the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time after Andre Schurrle's goal sealed a 4-2 aggregate win over Gent.

The Germans had the best chance of a dour first half but Joshua Guilavogui's 20-yard shot was saved by Matz Sels.
They wrapped up victory when Julian Draxler picked out Schurrle after a driving run to the byeline.
Danijel Milicevic's shot wide from Moses Simon's cross was the closest the Belgian team came to scoring.
Dieter Hecking's Wolfsburg side have dropped to seventh in the Bundesliga after a disappointing sequence of one win in nine games, but they deserved victory against plucky but limited opponents.
Before the game, Gent coach Hein Vanhaezebrouck said his side would need a "miracle", but they lacked the attacking quality to fashion clear-cut chances.
The Belgian champions beat Valencia, Lyon and Zenit St Petersburg to qualify from the group stage, but they never threatened a repeat here.
And Schurrle's late strike ensured that Belgium's wait for a first Champions League quarter-finalist would continue.
