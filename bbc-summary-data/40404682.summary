Government buildings fell silent and people gathered in public places at midday to remember those affected.
A van was driven into worshippers leaving Ramadan prayers close to the Muslim Welfare House mosque in north London just after midnight on 19 June.
Mr Ali, 51, died from multiple injuries and 11 other people were injured.
Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, has been charged with terrorism related murder and attempted murder.
Speaking at the vigil on the step of Islington Town Hall, the chairman of Finsbury Park Mosque, Mohammed Kozbar, thanked all communities for their "solidarity and support" and said the attack was no different from recent terrorist attacks in Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge.
"After what's happened, we are stronger, we are more united, to make sure that those who try to divide us, to spread hate, fear and division in our communities, will fail," he said.
