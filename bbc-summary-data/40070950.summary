A 2-1 win over Aberdeen in Saturday's Scottish Cup final sealed the clean sweep for the former Liverpool manager.
"It's been incredible," Rodgers told BBC Scotland. "I couldn't have written the script any better.
"I was born into Celtic and it's a huge privilege to manage this club."
Celtic fell behind to a Jonny Hayes goal at Hampden, but Stuart Armstrong squared it soon after with a 20-yard strike.
Rodgers' side won the match with a stoppage-time goal from Tom Rogic, completing a fourth clean sweep in the club's history.
Aberdeen finished runners-up in all three domestic competitions this term.

"If you're going to create history, which we've done, then you have to make it happen and the players have done that," Northern Irishman Rodgers said.
"Now you can write about it and talk about it, give a big congratulations to the players and supporters, because they've been amazing. It's a great day for the club
"It was a really tough game and, as well as to my own players, give credit to Aberdeen. They made it really tough for us, in particular the first half.
"We had to dig deep, we weren't quite as fluent in our game and that's credit to them, they broke the game up quite well.
"They man mark and it takes a bit of time, but we just reinforced at half-time the idea to stay calm, eventually they tire and that's what started to happen.
"In the second half, we created chances and are disappointed not to score one or two more - but we got the goal in the end and thoroughly deserved it."
Rodgers has had a huge impact in his debut season at Celtic and skipper Scott Brown said the historic campaign "all comes down to the gaffer".
"This is a special bunch of lads and we've got a phenomenal manager," added the Scotland midfielder. "And it's great thanks to every single one at this club - everyone behind the scenes that worked 24/7 to help us win this trophy and this treble.
"Aberdeen are a great team, they pushed us all the way in both cups and the league and they deserve to be in cup finals and second in the league."
