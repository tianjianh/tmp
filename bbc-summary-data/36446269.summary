"Ashe is expected to remain on the sidelines for several months, with the aim of returning to action at the beginning of next season," they said.
He picked up the injury during May's Pro12 semi-final defeat by Connacht.
The Scotland international, 22, has been with Warriors since turning professional with them in 2012.
