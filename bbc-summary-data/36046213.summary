French Open: Laura Robson to enter main draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Laura Robson will use her protected ranking of 58 to gain direct entry into the French Open main draw in May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robson chose not to use that privilege at the Australian Open while recovering from a series of wrist injuries.
The 22-year-old returned from a 17-month lay-off in June but had a relapse and did not play until Indian Wells last month, losing in the first round.
There will be four British women in France, with Robson joining Johanna Konta, Heather Watson and Naomi Broady.
Andy Murray, Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund enter the men's main draw at Roland Garros, running from 22 May to 5 June.
