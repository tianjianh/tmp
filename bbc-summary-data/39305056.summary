Cardiff's Global Foods' £120,000 hygiene fine cut

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A food wholesaler fined £120,000 for using an unrefrigerated vehicle to deliver "high-risk" goods has had its penalty reduced on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Global Foods Ltd, based in Cardiff, was found delivering meat to a takeaway in an unsuitable van in December 2015.
It was handed the fine by magistrates in January.
At Newport Crown Court on Friday, this was cut to to £80,000 after the company successfully argued the fine was "disproportionate".
Global Foods Ltd said the wrong delivery truck had been loaded in error by a driver.
The original fine came after the company was issued with a legal notice in September 2014 following a complaint about cheese and ham being unrefrigerated.
The court heard the company had no previous convictions, had cooperated fully with Cardiff council, had purchased more refrigerated vans and had since implemented a scheme for temperature control.
Tim Petrides, for Global Foods, said it was "an isolated incident".
"This is not a case of not being able to afford to pay. It's about fairness," he said.
The court heard Cardiff council, which brought the prosecution, agreed the original fine was too high.
