Lorry drivers and dock workers have protested outside the Port of Liverpool in a row over toilet and catering facilities.

The union Unite said there is a lack of adequate facilities for drivers waiting to enter the port at Seaforth.
About 100 protesters gathered at the entrance to the terminal.
Owners Peel Ports agree there is a problem "outside the port estate" where hauliers queue and said it has asked local authorities to seek a solution.
The protest comes after the new Â£400m Liverpool2 deep sea terminal opened at the port in November.
There are "intolerable conditions" for lorry drivers who get backed up along Regent and Dunningsbridge Road when delayed accessing the port, Unite regional officer Colin Carr said.
He said there are no toilets or canteen facilities available for them while dock workers have no "hot food after 2pm or at weekends, as well as no trade union facilities for health, safety and workplace representatives".
Steven Gerrard, who has worked at the port for 20 years as a lorry driver, said toilets are "inadequate" and there is "no specific toilet facility for female drivers".
Mr Carr said though Peel Ports is investing to make Seaforth the "dock of the future", it "is more like a port of the past" with "scant regard" for "wellbeing and welfare at work" .
A spokeswoman for Peel Ports said that while visiting lorry drivers "have full use of the customer service toilets on Container Terminals 1 and 2... we do agree that operations outside the port estate - where hauliers do queue - need to be looked into."
She said the firm has written to tenant companies and local councils look for "a viable solution to drivers' needs".
