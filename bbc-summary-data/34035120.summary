Rethink needed over Scottish carbon targets, study says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland needs to shift a fifth of its spending on new buildings and transport towards backing for its targets of big cuts in carbon emissions, a new study has claimed.

A report published by the Task Force on Low Carbon Infrastructure said less should be spent on projects that increase energy use.
That could include new roads.
The Scottish government said the report was a "valuable contribution" to shifting to a low-carbon economy.
The report argues that it is better to build now for changed public choices and behaviour, travel patterns and energy efficiency standards rather than alter infrastructure when the changes have taken place.
Compiled by the Green Alliance think tank, it says there are "critical weaknesses" in the way Scotland now spends.
It says international comparisons suggest 72% of infrastructure spending in other countries is on projects designed to reduce carbon emissions, whereas that is thought to be 52% in Scotland.
The report's authors set a challenge to see that 20-point gap closed - a change for a fifth of infrastructure spending.
The "Scotland's Way Ahead" report pushes for further progress on renewable electricity, transport, housing and waste, but says the approach should also apply across health, schools, the digital economy, culture and justice.
One of the main areas addressed is in local district heating of homes and other buildings. It argues for a more co-ordinated approach, rather than project-by-project.
And while it says telecom links will allow people to work from home and reduce commuting, it suggests a better understanding is required of how that could increase energy use in workers' homes.
The report argues that there are benefits from more emphasis on capital spending to reduce energy use.
Less use of cars - with more walking or cycling - can help health, lower energy use should help cut fuel poverty and there are tens of thousands of "low-carbon" jobs yet to be created.
Sara Thiam, chairwoman of the task force, said: "As Scotland prepares to spend billions of pounds over the coming decades to upgrade our ageing infrastructure, it's essential we invest wisely for the future, building infrastructure that improves our economy, environment and quality of life for the people of Scotland in the 21st Century and beyond."
As a director of the Institute of Civil Engineers, she added that the challenge of the report could "inspire the next generation of men and women into the profession to build on the legacy of famous engineers of the past including Telford, Watt, Arrol and Stevenson".
She added: "They have the potential to build a better world by getting involved in 21st Century engineering projects that will stand the test of time, as the Forth Bridge has done."
A Scottish government spokeswoman said the report was a "valuable contribution" to the challenge of shifting to a low-carbon economy.
"Establishing Scotland as a low-carbon place is already a central theme of Scotland's National Planning Framework," she said. "We are also broadening our infrastructure approach, building on the success of our approach to renewable energy.
"For example, in June we announced that improving the energy efficiency of Scotland's homes and non-domestic building stock would be designated a National Infrastructure Priority."
Dr Sam Gardner, Task Force member and head of policy at WWF Scotland, said: "The report shows that Scotland's climate action plan must be matched by an infrastructure plan that ensures we build the foundations for a low-carbon future.
"Securing the benefits of a low-carbon Scotland will mean shifting the focus from projects that lock in high-carbon emissions to the essential fabric of a low-carbon economy such as energy efficiency, district heating and sustainable transport."
Ross Martin, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Development & Industry, said: "As we take our next few steps on our journey to a low-carbon economy, we recognise the importance of infrastructure in supporting our drive for higher productivity, greater levels of innovation and a stronger presence in international markets - the three key economic challenges of our time.
"This report sheds new light on this important issue enabling us to view low-carbon infrastructure from this economic perspective."
