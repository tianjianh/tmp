[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire captain Jim Troughton has announced his immediate retirement from professional cricket because of a persistent back problem.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old batsman, who made his Bears debut in 2003, played 167 first-class matches, averaging 35.67.
He played six one-day internationals for England in 2003, scoring 36 runs.
"Jim Troughton's retirement is sad but not, alas, unexpected.
"At his best, Troughton was among the most graceful batsmen in county cricket, a left-hander whose cover-driving was a feature of countless Edgbaston days, and a formidable fielder.
"Late in his career he proved to be an astute and creative captain, taking Warwickshire close to the title in his first season and winning it in his second.
"His leadership skills and high professional standards were of huge value to the county, and many will hope they still can be in the future, if that is the path he chooses."
"After what has been a difficult 14 months dealing with back problems, I am devastated to concede that my playing days are over," he said.
"Warwickshire has been my life. I feel privileged to have been associated with such a fantastic club.
"I have been lucky to have played alongside so many amazing players and coaches, who I will regard as friends for life.
"Captaining Warwickshire has been the proudest achievement of my career. I wish them all the best for the rest of the season and for the future."
Troughton was part of the County Championship-winning Bears team of 2004, before going on to lead the side to a second title in 2012.
He also earned winners' medals in the 2002 Benson & Hedges Cup and the CB40 in 2010.
An occasional left-arm bowler, Troughton took 22 first-class wickets at an average of 64.36.
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown added: "Jim has been a model professional, having won multiple trophies, and has set outstanding standards, on and off the field, for young cricketers to follow.
"Whilst we're very sad that he has to retire in this way, all members of the playing and coaching team are very proud at what he has achieved in the professional game.
"It has been a pleasure to work and play alongside him and as a Championship-winning skipper he will always have a special place in the history of the club."
