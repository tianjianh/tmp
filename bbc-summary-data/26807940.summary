The remains may be part of a massive emergency burial pit where thousands of plague victims were left 600 years ago.
Lead archaeologist Jay Carver says the find "solves a 660-year-old mystery".
"This discovery is a hugely important step forward in documenting and understanding Europe's most devastating pandemic," he said.
