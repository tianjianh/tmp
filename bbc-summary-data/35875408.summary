Karl Oyston harassment case against Blackpool fans dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charges have been dropped against two Blackpool fans accused of harassing the football club's chairman Karl Oyston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Reed, 58, and David Ragozzino, 33, were charged after an investigation into text messages sent to Mr Oyston.
Mr Reed, of Common Edge Road and Mr Ragozzino, of Oakwood Close, both Blackpool, appeared before city magistrates earlier.
The court heard the Crown Prosecution Service has discontinued the case after a review of the evidence.
A CPS spokeswoman said: "After receiving further information from the police we have conducted a review of all the evidence in the case and have concluded that there is no longer a realistic prospect of conviction against either defendant for a charge of harassment and have therefore taken the decision to discontinue the case."
