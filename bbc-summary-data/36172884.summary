Rugby fans who experienced crowded trains on their way to Cardiff's Principality Stadium for Judgement Day are being advised the return journey could be just as busy.

About 66,000 fans headed to the capital to watch the four Welsh regions in action, with the Blues playing the Ospreys and Dragons taking on the Scarlets.
Extra trains were put on amid reports of services being very busy.
Arriva Trains Wales has apologised.
A spokeswoman for the train company said: "We apologise for the inconvenience and discomfort caused to our customers travelling to the Judgement Day event due to overcrowding on certain services today.
"We were expecting our trains to be extremely busy and a number of services were strengthened and capacity increased where possible however, there is only a limit to the number of additional carriages available to us.
"Customers are advised to ensure they make their way back to Cardiff Central Station with plenty of time to catch services advertised in the normal timetable and seats will be allocated on a first come first served basis."
Full road closures around the city will be in operation until 20:00.
Enhanced security measures were put into operation at the stadium, so people travelling to the games were advised to leave plenty of time.
Arriva Trains Wales said they had put on 2,000 additional seats, but fans reported some issues with crowding on trains.
