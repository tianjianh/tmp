Election 2015: TUSC's 'real anti-austerity' promise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) has launched its Welsh campaign, promising to increase the minimum wage and end austerity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
TUSC is contesting 135 seats across Britain, and 12 of the 40 in Wales.
Party candidate Ross Saunders said the party provides a real anti-austerity alternative for ordinary people.
TUSC's policies include raising the minimum wage from Â£6.50 to Â£10 an hour, scrapping university tuition fees and introducing rent controls.
"We think that the brutal austerity the coalition government has visited upon ordinary people in Britain has made misery for millions and has also damaged the economy," Mr Saunders
"We think an alternative has got to be forced on the agenda and we don't think any of the existing parties can be trusted to do that."
