Income needs falling for families

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Income needed for an "acceptable" standard of living has fallen slightly for most families compared with a year ago, social policy campaigners say.

A couple with two children needed to each have an income of £20,024 for a minimum income standard, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) said.
This was £263 lower than a year earlier, it said, but those on the minimum wage still fell short.
They had a shortfall of £74 a week on the foundation's measure.
The JRF gathered information from focus groups to set a benchmark for an acceptable standard of living.
Among those features is the view that all working age households would consider a computer and home internet connection as essential.
The group said that lone parents with one child needed an annual income of £26,725, down from £27,073 in 2014.
Both groups saw an income shortfall among families reliant on benefits, it said.
Single people were the only group to see their minimum income requirement fail to fall. In 2015, it stood at £17,102, up slightly from £17,072 in 2014.
Rent rises for these people were swallowing up cuts in taxation and falls in the cost of some items, such as food, in the stores.
Julia Unwin, chief executive of the JRF, said: "After seven years of declining living standards, the pause in rising costs is a very welcome respite.
"But many low-income households are still much worse off than in 2008, leaving them struggling to make ends meet and reliant on benefits to top up their incomes."
