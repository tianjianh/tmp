The 30-year-old led the Cavaliers to last season's NBA finals, in which they lost 4-2 to the Golden State Warriors.
James, a four-time NBA most valuable player, joined the Cavaliers as their first draft pick in 2003 before moving to Miami Heat in 2010.
He quit his contract in Miami, with whom he won two NBA titles, to return to the Cavaliers last season.
His new deal is reported to be for a further two years.
Cavaliers general manager David Griffin said: "LeBron's re-signing is a reflection and continuation of his strong personal commitment to help deliver championships to Northeast Ohio and Cavs fans everywhere.
"His impact upon this team, his community and the game are impossible to overstate and we look forward to continuing on our mission together."
