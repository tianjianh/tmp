[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Swansea council has been told to expect a challenge to his leadership after sacking two cabinet members in a reshuffle.

David Phillips dismissed his member for finance, Rob Stewart, and Will Evans, who held the education portfolio.
Mr Phillips said his team needed to be "fully signed-up" to achieving Labour goals so close to a general election.
But Labour sources said support for the leadership challenge was sufficient to remove Mr Phillips from office.
The sources said there were concerns about Mr Phillips's performance, but another figure said it was the commitment of Mr Stewart and Mr Evans to the policies on which the party had been elected that was at issue.
The leader said he was not willing to discuss Labour group matters but did confirm he had felt a need to refresh his team.
"We are just a few months out from a key General Election and Labour's local performance will be a factor in that election," Mr Phillips said.
"We really have to start driving forward the commitments upon which we were elected.
"Labour's manifesto was very clear, if challenging, and everyone has to be fully signed up to their achievement."
Mr Stewart and Mr Evans declined to comment on the row.
In a brief statement Swansea council said: "This is entirely a political matter upon which officers have not and will not comment."
