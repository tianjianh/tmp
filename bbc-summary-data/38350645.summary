The 26-year-old Scot clocked one minute 29.39 seconds to beat South Korean world number one Choi Min-jeong.
Team-mate Kathryn Thomson reached the quarter-finals.
Christie's success in Gangneung follows her double gold in the 500m events in the Chinese World Cup in Shanghai last weekend.
She will have the chance to go for another double gold on South Korea's 2018 Winter Olympics track in the second 1,000m event on Sunday.
Gangneung is the fourth World Cup event of six to be held over 2016-17, with the next taking place in Dresden, Germany on 3-5 February.
