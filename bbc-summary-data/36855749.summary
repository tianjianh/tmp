Riding shotgun, Mrs Obama sang along to hits by Beyonce and Stevie Wonder - although her security limited the drive to the White House compound.
Mrs Obama confessed she had only ridden in the passenger's seat of a car once in the last seven years.
Corden began hosting CBS's The Late, Late Show in March last year.

Other guests on Cordon's Karaoke have included Adele, Sir Rod Stewart, Sir Elton John, Justin Bieber, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez and One Direction.
