Hawick enterprise zone call after knitwear job losses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MSP has called for the creation of an "enterprise zone" for Hawick at a meeting to discuss its economic future.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hawick Knitwear went into administration last month with the loss of more than 100 jobs.
Business Minister Fergus Ewing was in the town to chair a forum looking at the way forward.
Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire MSP John Lamont said a first enterprise zone in the Borders could encourage investment.
After the meeting, Mr Ewing said that it was time to "consider the specifics" of what could be done to help the town such as refurbishing old buildings and boosting digital infrastructure.
"Let's see what in practice we can actually do - positive, practical things, I am a great believer in that," he said.
He said he would return to Hawick later in the year for a further forum to take those plans forward.
Mr Ewing added that a task force had not been ruled out if it was required.
"I am not sure that a task force would of itself provide solutions to some of the issues today which I think are far more ingrained and wide-reaching," he said.
He said there was a "sense of purpose" from the meeting to look at specifics and develop a vision of the Borders as a "great place to live and work".
Mr Lamont said an enterprise zone would offer a "range of incentives" including business rates relief, fast track planning applications, the prioritisation of high speed broadband, specific skills and training support and advice for businesses on international growth.
"Hawick needs a radical, long term and co-ordinated plan to get it back on track," said Mr Lamont.
"Meetings and warm words will simply not be enough.
"While we need to continue investing in broadband and transport in the Borders, more needs to be done to reverse the decline that we have seen in Hawick in recent years, both in the textiles industry and on the High Street."
