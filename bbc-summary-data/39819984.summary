Pro12: Glasgow Warriors 18-29 Edinburgh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh spoiled Gregor Townsend's farewell as Glasgow coach with victory at Scotstoun but the Warriors regained the 1872 Cup 43-41 on aggregate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Duncan Weir kicked three penalties to Finn Russell's two to nudge the visitors 9-6 ahead before Jonny Gray's try gave Glasgow a half-time lead.
But two more Weir penalties and Damien Hoyland's score put Edinburgh 22-11 up.
Tommy Seymour had a try ruled out for Glasgow before Stuart Hogg went over, but Glenn Bryce's try sealed victory.
Weir's conversion with the last kick of the game meant Edinburgh came two points short overall, having lost the first leg 25-12 at Murrayfield on Boxing Day.
But Duncan Hodge's side finished their season with back-to-back victories before Richard Cockerill takes over as head coach this summer.
This was a match of attrition, the slowest of slow burners. It was ferociously competitive but, for large parts, ferociously dull, until Edinburgh kicked on in the second half and then Glasgow stirred themselves to go in pursuit.
Edinburgh had a strong breeze on their backs in the opening half and it was 6-6 after the first quarter. The only thing that could be said was that it was a thumpingly tough game, interrupted by multiple errors, a mountain of penalties, two Edinburgh sin-binnings, a little bit of narkiness and precious little of anything that might constitute entertaining rugby.
This is not how Scotstoun had imagined Townsend's farewell, before he replaces Vern Cotter as Scotland coach next month.
Edinburgh survived despite conceding penalty after penalty and losing man after man. Ross Ford was binned and yet the men from the capital somehow won that 10-minute spell 3-0 with a third penalty from the unerring boot of Weir. Then, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne walked for another build-up of offences and for two minutes Glasgow lived inside Edinburgh's 22 while up against 13 players.
They butchered their first chance to make Edinburgh pay, but took their second. Ford had come back on, but that hardly mattered when Scott Cummings galloped forward and offloaded sumptuously out of the side door to his second-row partner, Jonny Gray. The captain strode on to score.
Russell missed the conversion and the difference between the kickers was emphasised when Weir, into the breeze, put over a fourth penalty early in the second half and then a fifth to make it 15-11.
Glasgow had missed a couple of try-scoring chances just before. Their lack of accuracy, and Edinburgh's fine defence, kept them out. Jamie Ritchie was terrific in the back row for Hodge's team.
Just before the hour, Edinburgh made things really interesting when Hoyland skipped through a porous Glasgow defence and went over for a try that was converted by Weir. That brought it to 22-11. In the context of the 1872 Cup, that put Edinburgh only two points behind on aggregate.
There was a response from Glasgow. Seymour was just about held up as he crashed over the Edinburgh line, then Hogg skipped over for a try that Russell converted. The fly-half had a chance to make it a one-point game with 11 minutes left on the clock but missed a straightforward penalty.
Edinburgh, a crushing disappointment all season, at least finished powerfully. When Glasgow threatened to win it, they showed cool heads, tremendous desire and a lot of precision to get Bryce over for the match-winning try at the end. Weir, as you knew he would, added the conversion to complete the upset. A considerable upset at that.
Cockerill will have been impressed with what he saw, Townsend - and the arriving Dave Rennie - less so. Edinburgh delivered nothing all season in the Pro12, but they roused themselves to spoil Townsend's goodbye.
Edinburgh interim head coach Duncan Hodge: "It was reward for all the hard work that has gone in. We showed glimpses today of what we could do.
"We had to defend for huge amounts of the game, so to stick in and come away with a win, against the wind in the second half, was a tremendous effort."
Edinburgh wing Damien Hoyland: "We knew it was going to be all about energy and effort.  Even when we conceded just before half-time, we had two guys in the bin and really made them fight for that try.  We knew with guys coming back on, we could push them hard in the second half.
"Coming to Scotstoun and beating Glasgow - we haven't done that for a long time - will give us a massive boost going into next season."
Glasgow full-back Stuart Hogg: "I thought we were going to do it at the end but credit to Edinburgh, I thought they were outstanding. We didn't perform anywhere near our best and you can see that in the final result.
"We wanted to send everyone off in style but unfortunately we weren't able to do that.  Gregor has turned this team around and unfortunately we are not giving him the send-off he deserves."
