Prince Harry has said he no longer struggles with his royal role and wants to "make something" of his life.

Speaking in an ITV documentary about his charity work in Lesotho, the prince said losing his mother at a young age made him question his position.
He said he used to "bury his head in the sand" but now views life "very, very differently".
Harry co-founded the Sentebale charity with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho to help young people affected by HIV/Aids.
The 32-year-old prince told the programme: "I always feel like I need to make something of my life.
"I was fighting the system, going 'I don't want to be this person; my mother died when I was very, very young and I don't want to be in this position'.
"But now I'm just so fired up and energised to be lucky enough to be in a position to make a difference."
Sentebale has delivered adolescent HIV testing and counselling services to more than 21,000 people since it was founded in 2006, and plans to expand into several sub-Saharan African countries by 2020.
Harry was interviewed by broadcaster Tom Bradby, who shadowed the prince when he first visited Lesotho 12 years ago.
The prince said it was "fun to be good and boring to be bad".
"If you're me, if you're your Average Joe, whoever you are, if you can't affect politics and change the big things in the world then just do whatever you can do.
"Whether it's in your local community, your village, your local church, walking down the street, opening a door for an old lady, helping them cross the road.
"Whatever if it is, just do good. Why wouldn't you?"
The programme, due to be broadcast on Monday 19 December, also features contributions from musicians Sir Elton John, Joss Stone and Chris Martin of Coldplay.
Harry is reunited with a teenager he met on his first visit and is seen dancing with local children.
