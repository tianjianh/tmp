His Nobel certificate as well jewellery and other personal items were also recovered.
Three people have been arrested.
Mr Satyarthi was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for his work to combat child labour and child trafficking in India.
He shared the award with Pakistani child education activist Malala Yousafzai for her work on female education.
Mr Satyarthi said no-one was home at the time of the burglary last week.
"I had complete faith in the government, the police and the people of this great nation. I thank the Delhi police for the brilliant and speedy recovery of the items stolen from my residence," Mr Satyarthi was quoted by India Today website as saying.
The 63-year-old founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan, or the Save the Childhood Movement, which campaigns for child rights and an end to human trafficking.
Mr Satyarthi has long campaigned against child labour and rescued children from servitude.
His efforts have seen tens of thousands of children rescued from hazardous industries and rehabilitated.
