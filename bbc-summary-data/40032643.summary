Machynlleth fly tipping 'increase' as waste service ends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fly tipping in Powys has increased since a bulky waste collection service was withdrawn, a councillor has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The service in Machynlleth was introduced as a compromise following the closure of the Potters Yard recycling centre in January 2015, but was withdrawn last year to save money.
Powys council advises people to dispose of bulky items in Newtown, a 60-mile round trip, or pay Â£25 for collection.
But Michael Williams said constituents had been turned away from that centre.
He has written to new council leader Rosemarie Harris asking for the fortnightly collection, at Maengwyn Street, to be reinstated.
The council confirmed it had received the correspondence and would respond to Mr Williams, and to Machynlleth town council, in due course.
The council previously said it was not able to continue the service due to its high running costs.
"It was one of the most misguided decisions I can ever recall as a councillor for Machynlleth," Mr Williams, who has been a councillor for 37 years, said.
"People are appalled about that decision and the result has been one of awful fly tipping.
"The county council may say 'we haven't had a great amount on our land' but I would challenge that and say there has been an awful lot, and also on private land and forestry areas."
Mr Williams added some people were taking their waste to other counties, including Gwynedd and Ceredigion, but the majority had been sticking to the council's advice to go to Newtown - but some transit vans and trailers had been turned away from that centre.
"These are not commercial vehicles, they are residents who drive transit vans and are refused admission and told to carry their items into the centre [rather than drive].
"I can't stress too strongly how angry my constituents are."
