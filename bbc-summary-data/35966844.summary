James Summers, formerly of Lyndene Road, Didcot, was found guilty after a week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court.
He was convicted of two counts of raping a girl under 13 and two counts of indecent assault on a female.
The crimes happened between 1995 and 2000. He is already serving an 18-year prison sentence for six counts of rape dating back to the 1980s.

Summers was originally convicted in 2012. He carried out all his offences in Didcot.
Det Con Tania Wasilewski-Norman, from Thames Valley Police, said he used to be well-known in the area for his work with the Salvation Army.
She said: "[He] used that position of trust to gain access to his young victims and subsequently sexually abused them.
"Both of the victims in this case, who are now adults, have shown great bravery in coming forward."
A spokesperson for the Salvation Army said Summers had committed a "gross breach of trust" when he was a volunteer.
They added: "We acted immediately by co-operating with the police and by instructing him to stand down from all Salvation Army activities while the police investigated the claims.
"We would like to reassure the public that there is no hiding place for anyone who wishes to prey on vulnerable people."
