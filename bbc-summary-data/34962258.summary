Lord Feldman: The key questions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative Party chairman Lord Feldman, a close friend of David Cameron, is under pressure over the party's handling of bullying allegations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Senior Tory MPs have questioned the independence of an inquiry into claims that an aide, Mark Clarke, bullied a young activist - Elliott Johnson - who apparently took his own life.
Mr Clarke, once seen as a rising star of the party, was struck off a list of approved Tory election candidates after complaints were made about his behaviour in 2010. He was given a "second chance" in the words of former chairman Grant Shapps with a campaigning initiative called RoadTrip which bussed young volunteers around the country to campaign ahead of the 2015 General Election. He has since been banned for life from the Conservative Party after accusations of bullying, harassment and blackmail, which he denies.
Yes. Some Tory MPs are very clear: Lord Feldman will have to go, says one. His position is untenable says another. This is all about Dave's mates, a critic insists.
Lord Feldman was one of four officials who agreed to give Mark Clarke a formal role in the Conservative election campaign. One of the four - Grant Shapps - has resigned. Among those not calling for Lord Feldman to quit immediately, there is limited sympathy.
While some believe he has been unfairly targeted, the Tory's chairman's decades-long friendship with his tennis partner and Oxford college May Ball committee colleague David Cameron is a double-edged sword.
Close friends of the PM's are not necessarily bosom buddies of the Parliamentary party. Well-connected MPs say the PM's man won't have much support among Tory colleagues as things hot up.
The Conservatives are holding an inquiry. David Cameron says it will be overseen by an independent lawyer. But Tory officials will collect the evidence. In other words, people who are - in the end - Lord Feldman's staff will be running an investigation that could end Lord Feldman's career, and in which he is a witness.
The law firm Clifford Chance will review that evidence, decide if the inquiry has done enough and recommend disciplinary action.
But the final decisions about who - if anyone - should be punished will be made by the party board, of which Lord Feldman is the chairman.
A Tory source said he would play no part in making those decisions, but they will be made by his colleagues. MPs in key positions have questioned the independence of the probe. More importantly, so has Elliott Johnson's father Ray.
Even those MPs who want to keep Lord Feldman in place say the way the Conservative Party runs needs a shake-up. It is simply not clear - they argue - to whom a young activist should report incidents of alleged harassment.
Big companies would demand higher standards, they argue so too should the Tories.
Plenty of Tories think the former chairman Grant Shapps was forced out of his job by Downing Street.
"They are using Grant Shapps as a scapegoat," says one senior MP. "He's not a popular character so they can get away with it."
Mr Shapps though has been telling friends this was entirely his decision, and he first drafted a resignation letter over a week ago on a flight back from Africa. It may be entirely accidental, but his departure has put more energy into the story, not less.
With a resignation the prime minister was compelled to comment, and now there is a fresh focus on Lord Feldman.
Most importantly though, this is very different from the usual political crisis. At its heart is not the fate of a career or two, but the death of a 21-year-old man.
Ray Johnson is clear. Lord Feldman must go, he says, and an inquiry should be absolutely independent. His moral authority, and the prospect of an inquest, means this story will endure.
