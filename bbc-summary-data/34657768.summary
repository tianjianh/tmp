Derby County chief executive and president Sam Rush has signed a new five-year contract with the club.

Rush joined the Rams in January 2013 from global sports and entertainment agency, the Wasserman Media Group.
"Prior to joining Derby County at the start of 2013, I had spent all of my life living in London but I now regard Derbyshire as my home," Rush said.
"I am delighted to have signed a new long-term contract at this magnificent football club."
Rush has overseen a number of changes at the iPro stadium including Mel Morris becoming Rams chairman in May and the appointment of Paul Clement as boss in the summer.
Clement has only lost one of his 13 league games in charge with Derby currently fifth in the Championship.
"My family are very settled here and we have a huge affinity with the club and local area, while the support of the fans has always been outstanding," Rush added.
"The arrival of Mel Morris is a huge moment in time for Derby County Football Club.
"There isn't a more exciting role in English football right now than working with Mel. I can only continue to learn from him over the coming years."
Derby-born businessman Morris became the club's sole owner in September after buying out the American ownership group for an undisclosed fee.
"Sam's arrival was a key part of a big turnaround for this club," Morris said.
"He has contributed hugely to where we find ourselves today. He was one of the main reasons why I wanted to get involved in May 2014.
"Like myself, Sam has a huge desire to try and help this club get back to where we believe it belongs and that's in the Premier League."
