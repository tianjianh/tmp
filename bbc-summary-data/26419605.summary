The jobs will be on the production line and in customer services at its UK Technology Centre (UKTEC) in Pencoed.
The electronics giant makes a range of its own and non Sony products at the factory including cameras, medical devices and a credit-card sized computer, the Raspberry Pi.
Economy Minister Edwina Hart welcomed the jobs boost.
"Sony is one of our anchor companies making an important contribution to the Welsh economy in terms of jobs, skills development and investment and their latest expansion is great news," she said.
UKTEC managing director Steve Dalton said the company had had a "successful few years", which has seen it expand its product portfolio as well as winning "significant manufacturing deals of non-Sony products".
"This diversification has been our key to survival," he said.
"It has lead to our success and enabled us to create additional job opportunities in Wales."
