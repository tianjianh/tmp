"I was pleased with the whole performance, bar a bit of naivety. I thought we passed the ball really well for the whole of the game but we just need to be ruthless.
"The way we played today was a lot of energy, a lot of running and a lot of balls down the sides and I thought we played very well.
"You look at the stats and they say we got one point over Easter which isn't great but you look at the performances and it's something to work on."
