Crystal Palace have signed Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho on loan for the rest of the season.

Palace will pay a £2m loan fee plus wages for Sakho, who has played 56 league games since his move from Paris St-Germain in 2013.
The France international, 26, has not played for the Reds since April because of off-field issues.
Palace have signed Serbia midfielder Luka Milivojevic, 25, from Olympiakos on a three-and-a-half-year deal.
Milivojevic started his career in Serbia before moving from Red Star Belgrade to Anderlecht in 2013. After a year in Belgium, he moved to Greece.
Sakho was sent home from Liverpool's pre-season tour of the United States by manager Jurgen Klopp as a disciplinary measure.
He was also handed a 30-day suspension by Uefa in April for testing positive for a prohibited substance following a Europa League tie against Manchester United the previous month.
Uefa failed to impose a further ban after Sakho's defence team questioned whether the substance, understood to be a fat-burner, should have been on its prohibited list.
Liverpool were demanding £20m for Sakho to leave permanently, with Southampton, Swansea, Galatasaray and Sevilla all thought to be interested in the centre-back.
Palace remain in the Premier League's bottom three despite new boss Sam Allardyce winning his first league game since taking charge with a 2-0 success at Bournemouth on Tuesday.
