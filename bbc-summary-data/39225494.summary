[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Paul Curran was discovered at a house in Manor Drive on Thursday afternoon.
It is understood a house party may have been taking place at the time of Mr Curran's death. Police were called to the house shortly after 14:50 GMT.
Three people - two men and a woman, all aged in their 30s - have been arrested.
A post mortem examination will be carried out to determine how Mr Curran, who was from the Taghnevan area of Lurgan, died.
DUP MLA Carla Lockhart, who represents the area, described it as a "very tragic incident" and expressed her sympathy to the victim's family.
"To have a young life cut short in such circumstances is shocking and a cause of concern to the wider community of Lurgan," she said.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Liam Mackle called "on anybody who has any information at all about it" to contact the police.
