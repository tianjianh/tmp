[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke's new signing Saido Berahino could make his debut off the bench following his move from West Brom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wilfried Bony and Mame Biram Diouf's involvement at the Africa Cup of Nations is over, but they may not be involved in this fixture.
Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye will not feature, despite his participation at that tournament also finishing.
Boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed Joel Robles will retain his starting place in goal ahead of Maarten Stekelenburg.
Alistair Bruce-Ball: "One of the most intriguing signings in this transfer window has been Stoke's acquisition of Saido Berahino, who scored just two goals in 30 Premier League appearances for West Brom after his move to Tottenham fell through in September 2015.
"He has wasted his ability since then but there's no denying that talent is there and Mark Hughes says he's been very impressed with what he's seen in training so far.
"Everton seem rejuvenated, with youngsters Tom Davies, Mason Holgate and Ademola Lookman all playing their part in a run of four wins in five league games, and Ross Barkley starting to sparkle again in what has been an up-and-down season for him under Ronald Koeman."

Stoke manager Mark Hughes on Saido Berahino: "Saido hasn't stopped smiling since he first walked into the building to be honest - he is just really excited to be here.
"He will be involved in the squad on Wednesday, which is what he deserves because he has trained every day and looks really sharp."
Everton manager Ronald Koeman: "Overall I think we are defending well, It is not easy to score against us.
"The team has really improved in terms of defensive organisation, I think we have improved in defending set plays - that was one of the biggest issues from last season - and that's because we've been working hard."
Toffees boss Ronald Koeman has been busy in the transfer market and there seems to be a bit more urgency in his team now.
It will be interesting to see how new Stoke striker Saido Berahino will do following his move from West Brom. He is an extremely good finisher and I think he will perk them up a bit.
