Oil company Valero has been called "incredibly arrogant" for not attending a meeting to discuss pipeline repairs in Carmarthenshire.

AM Adam Price said there had been a "total lack of engagement" over work on the A48 near Nantycaws.
Llangunnor Community Council invited Valero to Thursday's meeting after the road was shut for six weeks and a leak spilled into the Nant Pibwr river.
Valero said it had been "in constant contact" with affected residents.
About 30 residents from Nantycaws went to the meeting, along with representatives from the county council and Natural Resources Wales.
They have voiced concerns about longer term impacts of the work and the oil spill.
Resident Aled Davies told BBC Wales the removal of mature trees near the A48 carriageway for repair work had a huge detrimental impact.
"There's light pollution, there's sound. There's a low frequency noise... it's very depressing," he said.
Valero said it had started planting new trees along the A48.
Work began on the road in September after a defect was identified in the pipeline carrying oil products from Valero's Pembroke refinery.
But the Carmarthen East and Dinefwr AM Mr Price said there had been a "total lack of engagement" from Valero, and residents had suffered "terrible stress and anxiety."
Farmer Gareth Rees said: "The long term effects on animals and ecology... nature and wildlife... is ignored and I don't see what they're going to do to solve the problem."
In a statement, Valero said it had been in contact with those most affected by the work and oil spill, including face-to-face meetings with representatives from its agent Fisher German.
The firm confirmed it was also in discussion with the community council "regarding making a donation to support a project or projects in the local area.
"This is our way of saying thank you to them for their patience and understanding throughout the incident."
