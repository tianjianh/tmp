[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No staff or prisoners were injured in the "isolated incident" which lasted for about 40 minutes on one wing at HMP Cardiff at 10:00 GMT on Sunday.
"We do not tolerate this behaviour," said an MOJ statement.
Last week, four prisoners barricaded themselves into a cell at Cardiff prison in protest of being moved after riots in Birmingham.
No exact details of the latest disturbance have been given.
The MOJ said: "Prisoners who behave in this way will be punished and could spend significantly longer behind bars."
