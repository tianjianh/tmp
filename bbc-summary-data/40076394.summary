The former home of Stoke City FC is to be redeveloped into 200 homes, a park and fields, the council says.

The old Victoria Ground, next to the A500, shut in 1997 when the club moved to the Britannia Stadium and has remained vacant ever since.
Plans for the 16-acre site include 130 homes being built initially, followed by a further 70.
David Sidaway, from the council, said he was proud to have secured investment for the "very important site".
A plan to build offices there was shelved in 2004 and in 2007 St Modwen said the recession had affected development opportunities.
Further plans for housing were announced in 2013 but never happened.
Dave Smith, from developer St Modwen Homes, said: "We understand that the Victoria Ground is an important site for both the people of Stoke-on-Trent and the city council.
"Having taken the comments from the public consultation on board, particularly for the second phase of development, we are looking forward to turning our plans for the Victoria Ground site into reality and breathing new life into the community and surrounding area."
After working with the Environment Agency over potential flooding issues, a nearby primary school to include sports pitches in the development and holding a public consultation, plans will be submitted by the end of the month, the council said.
