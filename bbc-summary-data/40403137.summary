The 17-year-old asked not to be named but said he lost control of his silver hatchback when he swerved to avoid a cat in Parkway, Chellaston, Derbyshire.
He estimated he was travelling at about 30mph when he smashed into the garage of a residential home on Friday night.
The owners were away at the time and the crash was reported to police.
The driver told BBC News: "I swerved to the right and the back of the car went out.
"I then swerved to the left and lost control - I couldn't bring it back.
"I just missed two parked cars and a tree and ended up in the wall - it was a big impact.
"I smelt burning, I thought it was the car, so I got out and laid down - I was in shock."
Neighbours reported hearing a "loud screeching" followed by a "massive bang".
The driver said: "It was a natural reaction to swerve to miss the cat, but I went into a state of shock and panic."
Derbyshire Police said the driver was due to appear before magistrates at a later date charged with driving without due care or attention.
