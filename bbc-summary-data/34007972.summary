Bid to fill Highland fire vacancies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fire chiefs in the Highlands have launched a recruitment drive in a bid to fill dozens of vacancies among part-time fire crews.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Many fire stations in rural areas are staffed by firefighters who have their main jobs elsewhere.
Scottish Fire and Rescue is keen to attract more retained crew members.
But finding enough people to sign-up as part-time firefighters in some of Scotland's more remote communities has never been easy.
The latest recruitment drive has seen officers visiting local villages, handing out leaflets and speaking to potential recruits.
Many countryside residents now work in town from nine to five - so the fire service is particularly keen to target stay-at-home parents with school-age children who could be on call during those hours.
And especially women who may not have considered a part-time career as a firefighter.
Already people involved in professions like education, farming and the trades have picked up a fire service pager.
But senior officers say more are needed if local communities are to get the fire and rescue response they expect and deserve.
