Police called fire crews at 10:31 GMT over concerns of a potentially "noxious substance" at a detached house in Gleneldon Road in Streatham.
A 57-year-old man was found dead on the third floor. No-one else was hurt and 15 people were evacuated for safety.
The substance was assessed and readings from within the house were normal. The case has not been linked to terrorism.
A spokesman for the Met Police said the death was being treated as unexplained and formal identification had yet to take place.
Officials have declined to comment on the nature of the substance they suspected may pose a chemical hazard and residents were allowed to return by 12:19 GMT.
