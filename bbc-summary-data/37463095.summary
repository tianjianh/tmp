Watford captain Troy Deeney should be given an England call-up, his club manager Walter Mazzarri has claimed.

Uncapped Deeney, 28, who signed a new five-year deal in the summer, has scored in successive victories over West Ham and Manchester United.
Italian Mazzarri said: "Of course he is international level."
England manager Sam Allardyce will announce his squad later this week for the World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Slovenia.
Allardyce needs a replacement for Tottenham striker Harry Kane, who is facing a lengthy spell out after he injured his ankle this month.
Speaking through an interpreter, Mazzarri added: "I would be proud and really happy if Deeney went to the national team.
"He has improved physically and he is much fitter now. He is a strong striker - he just needs to look after his fitness.
"I respect the England manager and his decision, and I am biased as he is one of my players.
"The FA can call me with the help of an interpreter, but they haven't called up until now."
England, who opened their 2016 World Cup campaign with victory in Slovakia, host Malta at Wembley on Saturday, 8 October, then travel to Slovenia the following Tuesday.
