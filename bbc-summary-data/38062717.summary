Lochcarron-based scientist's images on Tristan stamps

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Photographs taken by a Highlands-based marine biologist and diver appear in two new sets of stamps for the world's most remote inhabited island.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sue Scott, from Lochcarron, Wester Ross, has been surveying wildlife on Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic on and off for the last 12 years.
The stamps are to be issued by the UK Overseas Territory next month.
A community was established on Tristan 200 years ago by Kelso-born Cpl William Glass.
The island formed part of British efforts to stop the French from freeing Napoleon when he was in exile on the isle of St Helena, 1,500 miles (2,414km) to the north, in 1815.
Glass and his family remained on Tristan after its garrison was eventually stood down. They were joined by sailors who set up homes on the island with women from St Helena.
Tristan's government has used the photographs by Ms Scott, a qualified diver, to highlight critically-endangered wildlife of the Tristan Archipelago, a group of volcanic islands.
The creatures to feature in the two sets of stamps include the Gough flightless moth, Tristan rock lobster and birds such as the inaccessible rail and spectacled petrel.
