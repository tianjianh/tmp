Police control room closure 'only if safe' says SPA chairman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chairman of the Scottish Police Authority has said Aberdeen's emergency control room will only be closed if it is safe to do so.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move is part of Police Scotland's cost-cutting plan to centralise control rooms.
If a decision is taken at a board meeting on 22 March it is thought likely that the centre will close quickly afterwards.
SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan said he had been consulting widely on the move.
He told BBC Scotland: "I think there are a number of local concerns about the closure. It's important we take account of local concerns.
"We need an assurance it's going to be effective."
