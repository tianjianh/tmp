[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham councillor convicted of sexual assault to resign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Rotherham councillor who was convicted of sexually assaulting a colleague has said he will resign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Roddison, 41, of Flatts Lane in Treeton, was accused of sexually assaulting a female councillor following a parade in Rotherham in May.
The Labour councillor for the Brinsworth and Catcliffe ward denied the charges, but he was found guilty at Leeds Magistrates' Court.
At the court hearing, he was given an indefinite restraining order.
He was also sentenced to a six-month curfew order, told to pay Â£500 in legal costs and given an Â£85 victim surcharge, the Crown Prosecution Service said.
In a statement, his solicitor Steve Smith said: "Having considered the financial options open to Mr Roddison it has been decided with great reluctance not to appeal.
"His income has been taken from him, and consequently he is resigning his position as a councillor."
Roddison, who was elected as a councillor in May 2011, had "given very good service to the council hitherto", Mr Smith added.
No official letter of resignation had been received from Roddison, said Rotherham Council.
A statement from the council said: "The leader of the council has already written to Councillor Roddison, making it clear that his behaviour has been unacceptable and urging him to stand down from his seat with immediate effect in the best interest of the community and the council."
