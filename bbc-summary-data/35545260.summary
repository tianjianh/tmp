Trade magazine BikeBiz reports Chain Reaction "is on the verge" of being acquired by Wiggle, who are owned by investment firm Bridgeport Capital.
A spokesman for Chain Reaction said it is "speculation at this point".
According to its last accounts, the Ballyclare-based business employs more than 500 staff.
It has a turnover in excess of Â£150m.
Wiggle and Chain Reaction have been fighting head-to-head for sales for years.
Chain Reaction sells bicycles, parts and accessories to more than 180 countries.
It began as a small bike shop more than 20 years ago, launching a website in 1999.
It has previously been described as Royal Mail's largest customer in Northern Ireland.
