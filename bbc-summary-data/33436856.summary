[SN]TITLE[SN]
Italy boss Antonio Conte could face trial for match-fixing involvement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Italy coach Antonio Conte could face a criminal trial for his alleged involvement in match fixing in 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He has already served a ban for not reporting alleged match-fixing in two games involving ex-club Siena in the 2010-11 season.
The former Juventus coach is among 104 people a prosecutor has requested to have charges pressed against them.
The 45-year-old, who has been accused of "sporting fraud", has always denied any wrongdoing.
The next step is for the judiciary to fix the date for a preliminary, closed-door hearing where a judge will decide whether to press charges, as the prosecutors have requested.
Conte has gone on to win three successive Serie A titles with Juventus before being appointed Italy coach last year.
The general inquiry followed alleged attempts to manipulate matches in Serie B, the Italian second division, and the third tier Lega Pro during the 2010-11 season, with some Coppa Italia matches also involved.
The Italian Football Federation has already conducted its own investigation and banned Conte for 10 months in 2012, later reduced to four months on appeal.
More than 50 players were banned for up to five years and a number of clubs, including Atalanta and Siena, have had points deducted by the FIGC over the case.
