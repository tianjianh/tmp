Police say they are treating the death of a man at Divis Tower flats in west Belfast as murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man who died was 62-year-old Jim Hughes.
His body was discovered in a flat on the 14th floor on Sunday night.  A 42-year-old man arrested on Sunday remains in custody.
Police have appealed for anyone who was on the 14th, 15th or 16th floors of the flats and heard anything suspicious on Saturday or Sunday to contact them.
Earlier, Sinn FÃ©in MLA Fra McCann said he believed two floors of the flats were evacuated late on Sunday night while a forensic search was carried out.
Mr McCann, who lives close to the scene, added: "I know the man personally, he was a very kind and well-liked person.
"He was a very spiritual man, always had a good and kind word for people
"He lived in this tower block for many, many years and got on well with everyone in the tower."
John Leathem, chairman of the Divis Residents' Association, paid tribute to Mr Hughes.
"James would have been a very loving person, a very caring person," Mr Leathem said.
"If somebody was sick, or he could assist you in any way, he would have."
