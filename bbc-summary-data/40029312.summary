The showcase also features a tense police drama written by ex-policeman Adam McNamara and conversations about a record collection.
Made in Scotland is funded through the Scottish government's Edinburgh Festivals Expo Fund.
It is in its 9th year and has funded 180 shows with almost Â£5m so far.
Its aim is to develop Scottish talent and support companies, ensembles and artists to move on towards international tours.
This year's Fringe, which takes place in August, marks its 70th anniversary.
Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said Made in Scotland had established itself as an "integral part" of the Fringe in the past decade, showcasing "excellent, bold and innovative work from Scotland".
She said: "This year's showcase features a rich variety of stimulating stories and talented artists."
The programme includes:
It is the true story of a young trans man crossing borders, from Egypt to Scotland, and genders, to find a place to call home. It features a 120-strong, international world choir of trans individuals.
The audience experiences what it is like for four police officers waiting in a riot van about to enter a flat where a man is wielding a samurai sword. The piece is written by former police officer Adam McNamara.
In 1972, Idi Amin ordered the expulsion of Ugandan-Asians under a 90-day deadline. In Dundee, a woman grows up knowing nothing about her homeland, haunted by Amin's impact on her destiny.
It started when MJ McCarthy and his great aunt Kathleen - 55 years his senior - connected over a stack of vinyl. Since then the Turntable team have toured her record case around Scotland, inviting listeners of all ages to investigate its contents whilst reflecting on the importance of music in their lives.
