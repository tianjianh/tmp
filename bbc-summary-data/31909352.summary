A convicted killer is among 10 of Britain's most wanted fugitives believed to be on the run in Spain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The National Crime Agency (NCA) has released the names of the most wanted, whose crimes range from rape to child abuse and drug trafficking.
The list was published in Madrid as part of Operation Captura.
It includes ex-soldier Shane Walford who was jailed in 2010 for the manslaughter of an off-duty fireman while on leave from the army.
Walford, a former boxer, killed father-of-two Paul Gibbons with a single punch inside a bar in Coventry.
He was jailed for four-and-a-half years but recalled to prison in August 2013 after breaking the terms of his licence.
He has numerous distinctive tattoos including a black panther on his left arm and boxing gloves on his abdomen.
Also on the list is Mohammed Jahangir Alam, 32, who was sentenced to 14 years in his absence in March 2010 for rape and sexual assault.
Bangladeshi Alam arrived in the UK on a temporary visa in October 2007 and moved to Cheltenham the following year, where he sexually abused his victim, the NCA said.
His last known address was in the E3 area of London.
A third fugitive, 52-year-old Carlo Dawson, from Croydon, south London, is wanted on suspicion of indecently assaulting a 12-year-old girl and making indecent photographs of a child. He has a two-inch scar on his right palm.
Hank Cole, the NCA's head of international operations, said: "Spain is not a safe haven for British fugitives. The NCA and its partners will continue to pursue these individuals relentlessly and return them to the UK to face justice.
"The exceptional level of collaboration and intelligence-sharing with the Spanish authorities has been vital to these arrests. However, we still need the support of the public."
Police are also hunting:
Since the launch of Captura in 2006, 65 out of 76 named suspects have been caught.  This is the ninth appeal of its kind.
One of the latest to be found in Tenerife was "drugs lord" Stephen Blundell, 36, from Merseyside, who fled the UK before being sentenced for a Â£1 million heroin plot, the NCA said.
