[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
George Pisi's early try put Saints ahead but Lloyd Evans and Ross Moriarty crossed to give Gloucester the lead.
George North went over just before half-time to reduce the deficit and his second try, plus second-half penalties from Stephen Myler, clinched the win.
Gloucester finished their campaign in eighth, nine points off the top six.
Greig Laidlaw had kicked two first-half penalties for Gloucester, as well as converting both of the home side's tries.
England captain Dylan Hartley made his first appearance in seven weeks, coming on from Northampton's bench.
The hooker had been sidelined since being knocked unconscious against France in the final game of the Six Nations in March.
Victory saw Saints complete a league double over Gloucester, after their 15-3 win at Franklin's Gardens in November.
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys:
"For the first 35 minutes, we were playing really well with ambition and accuracy.
"To build up a 20 points lead, that is time for us to kick on and win the game.
"Credit to Northampton, they came back but two of their tries came off our line-outs which is disappointing. It is not the reason we lost the game but it is very disappointing to finish the season like that."
Northampton Saints director of rugby Jim Mallinder:
"It is a satisfying win but we are not getting carried away because we want to finish in the top four.
"It is the first time in a few years that we have not done that, but we have to regroup. You reset your targets and that was to beat Bath and to beat Gloucester and to qualify in fifth position, so we are pleased that we have managed that.
"The Premiership starting late, due to the Rugby World Cup, was a disruption this season."
