German cult side St Pauli are known for being pioneering socialists on and off the pitch - and their latest good cause is the declining bee population.

The players from the Bundesliga 2 side run out to the song Hells Bells by rock band AC/DC, while the club is known for its skull-and-crossbones logo and left-wing stance against racism, sexism, fascism and homophobia.
Now, after having two beehives installed at their Millerntor stadium in Hamburg, St Pauli have become the first German club to produce their own honey.
The honey will be called Ewaldbienenhonig, named after manager Ewald Lienen and 'bienen', the German word for bees.
Residents within a 3km radius of the stadium have been asked to make "bee friendly" window boxes to help the insects flourish.
It is hoped the initiative will raise awareness of the declining bee population.
"Others have balconies to celebrate championships and we have them for the bees," said managing director Andreas Rettig.
