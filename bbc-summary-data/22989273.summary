The term refers to 17 people murdered and secretly buried by republican paramilitaries during the Troubles.
Since searches began, the bodies of 10 of the Disappeared have been recovered.
A further seven people have never been found.
They include west Belfast IRA man Joe Lynskey, Brendan Megraw from Twinbrook and SAS-trained officer Capt Robert Nairac.
The statement was issued to coincide with the launch of a new book The Disappeared Of Northern Ireland's Troubles that collates the personal stories of 14 of the families.
A day of reflection on the Troubles, and the future, is also being held on Friday, the longest day of the year.
"It is a day to reflect on the conflict in Northern Ireland and to acknowledge the deep hurt and pain caused," said Kate Turner, director of Healing Through Remembering.
"It is also a time to reflect on our attitudes with regards to what more we might have done and might now do, in order to bring about a peaceful new society."
