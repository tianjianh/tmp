He was found collapsed at Benson Road tram stop, in Winson Green, and pronounced dead at the scene, British Transport Police (BTP) said.
It is not known whether the man, in his 50s, was stabbed on the platform approach or injured elsewhere.
Police, who were made aware of the incident at about 16:50 BST, have started a murder investigation.
Det Ch Insp Tony Fitzpatrick, leading the investigation with West Midlands Police, said: "We're still trying to establish exactly how the man came to receive his injuries."
"The incident occurred around rush hour and I'm certain they would have been people around who can help us find out exactly what happened."
