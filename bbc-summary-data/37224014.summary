The decision to charge for new tickets for a rearranged match between Swindon Town and Bristol Rovers is "shocking", says Rovers manager Darrell Clarke.

Fans reacted angrily on social media to the news that refunds would not be offered for Saturday's game - abandoned after 60 minutes amid torrential rain.
Adults tickets for the rearranged match on 20 September will cost Â£19-25.
"Shocking, absolutely disgraceful. It's ridiculous for me, that is taking the mickey," Clarke told BBC Radio Bristol.
"I've never heard of that to be honest with you. If a game gets abandoned, you get your ticket refunded or you get a ticket to go and watch the replay of the game.
"For me, it undermines football. It's the general punters that miss out. I'm certainly not happy about that."
Earlier on Tuesday, Mike Welsh, vice-chair of Swindon Town's supporters' trust, urged Swindon to "rethink" their decision.
"Supporters were asked to keep their tickets stubs," Welsh told BBC Wiltshire. "We thought the club could have reached out to the fans and sought some middle ground.
"The club know perfectly well what they can do about it. The ball is very much in their court. We encourage them to come back, have a rethink and see if we can meet the fans halfway."
BBC Wiltshire contacted Swindon Town for comment, but nobody was available on Tuesday.
A statement on the club website said: "Swindon Town would like to advise supporters that the club must still cover matchday costs as they would for any home game."
Season ticket holders will not face additional charges for tickets to the rearranged game, but non-season ticket holders must purchase a new ticket.
A spokesperson for the Football Supporters Federation told BBC Wiltshire that lower-league clubs usually offered refunds when a match was abandoned before half-time, but not after.
Bristol Rovers' club website told fans: "Due to high policing costs for the match, Swindon have taken the decision to charge home and away supporters the full price for admission."
