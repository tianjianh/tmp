[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An entire Constituency Labour Party group (CLP) has been suspended following allegations of infighting, bullying and voting irregularities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood complaints centre around issues within Manchester Gorton CLP following a meeting on 2 July.
They are believed to be prompted by the possibility of Sir Gerald Kaufman's seat becoming free if he stands down at the next election.
A party spokesman said the CLP cannot hold meetings while an inquiry is held.
A North West Labour spokesperson said: "Any complaints of bullying or intimidation and allegations of misconduct are always taken very seriously by the Labour Party."
The Manchester Evening News reported a letter sent from Labour's head office states that the allegations relate to the conduct of members "both during and outside of Labour party meetings" as well as the "conduct of members of the CLP executive committee in administering internal ballots".
But a Greater Manchester Police spokesman said they were yet to receive any complaints and are not aware of reports that discussions between the force and the CLP have taken place.
The Gorton seat is currently held by 86-year-old Sir Gerald, one of the longest serving members of the Commons.
