[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some staff at the high-security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside have embarked on a 24-hour strike.

The walkout is in protest over the dismissal of two nurses involved in a violent struggle with a patient.
Kevin Gregson and Peter Hilton were sacked despite using "reasonable force" against the unidentified patient, said the Prison Officers' Association (POA).
But Mersey Care Trust, which runs Ashworth, said the evidence meant sacking the pair was its only option.

The dispute at the unit, one of three high security hospitals in England and Wales, began at 07:00 GMT.
Steve Gillan, the POA's general secretary, said: "I believe the general public will be outraged and extremely sympathetic to Mr Hilton and Mr Gregson, who were merely responding to a violent act in which the patient had headbutted a colleague and was spitting at staff during the incident.
"The actions of restraint were reasonable and the patient came to no harm, unlike the nurses. Whilst there should always be a duty of care towards patients the same must apply to staff."
The trust said it was "disappointed" by the union's decision to strike before the case is heard at an independent employment tribunal.
"We do not believe this is in the best interests of our patients, our carers, our staff and the communities we serve," it said in a statement.
Referring to the nurses' case the trust said it cares for "some of the most complex and vulnerable adults in a hospital setting".
"[And we] have an international and award-winning reputation for doing so," it said.
"This means our staff are highly trained... We never dismiss staff lightly.
"In the light of the evidence we felt we had no other course of action open to us than to dismiss two staff members."
The other high-security psychiatric hospitals in England and Wales are Rampton in Nottinghamshire and Broadmoor in Berkshire.
