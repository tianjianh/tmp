Now, the first festival dedicated to the work of Brian Friel has come to Belfast after a few days in County Donegal.
And that cross-border dimension is significant, according to the festival director Sean Doran.
"We've been inspired by him as he spent the first 40 years of his life in Northern Ireland, and is now living in the Republic of Ireland," he said.
He also said that while Friel will not be in Belfast for the festival, he has been instrumental in its creation.
"Over the last year, we've been getting his enthusiasm and support, and he's been wonderful and generous in just allowing us to run free."
But why has it taken us so long to have a festival dedicated to Friel?
"If he were gold in the earth or mineral resources we'd be digging it up long before now," Sean Doran said.
"He's up in the A-list league, not only in America and London, but in all languages because the themes he deals with are universal."
Belfast's Lyric Theatre is staging a new production of Friel's play Dancing at Lughnasa in association with the festival, 25 years after it was first performed.
The theatre's executive producer Jimmy Fay said Friel is one of the greatest dramatists in the world.
"He's a truly exceptional playwright, it's almost like having Shakespeare in your midst; he's the master," he said.
"I've watched this play repeatedly seven nights in a row before."
"This play gets deeper, there are layers and layers and layers, so it's well worth repeated watching."
It is directed by Annabelle Comyn, making it the first time a major production of the play in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland has been directed by a woman.
Jimmy Fay said she is ideally suited to the task.
"She's one of the best directors we have - very forensic and very thorough.
"She also corresponds brilliantly with the actors, who have brought a whole element of joy and intrigue and adventure to this production."
Whether it is Dancing at Lughnasa, Philadelphia Here I Come!, or Translations, very few people are unfamiliar with Friel's masterpieces.
But the festival includes much more than drama, with music, dancing, talks and even a kite festival at venues across the city.
Opera singer Ruby Philogene will be performing a concert at the historic Rosemary Street Presbyterian Church in the city centre.
"I will be singing as part of the Mundy concerts strand, and I will be singing a programme of negro spirituals which is connected to Dancing at Lughnasa.
"One of the characters in the play, Father Jack, went to Uganda and spent a lot of time with the natives there."
Ruby said the history of the church makes it significant.
"A former member of the church in the 18th Century, Thomas McCabe, was instrumental in fighting slavery in Belfast, so it's a very appropriate location for the songs."
There are also dance events, including a dance across the peace wall close to Lanark Way on Sunday afternoon.
Elsewhere, a number of prominent women, including broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, writers Lynn Barber and Kathy Lette and musician Feist, are taking part in the Amongst Women talks strand at Elmwood Hall.
Lughnasa International Friel Festival runs until Monday 31 August.  Dancing at Lughnasa is performed at the Lyric Theatre until 27 September.
