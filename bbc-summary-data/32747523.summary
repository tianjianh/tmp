The talks will focus on the practical measures needed to reopen embassies in Havana and Washington.
Although relations have improved in recent months a US trade embargo remains in place.
Last month President Barack Obama said Cuba would be removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism.
Havana had said it needed to be taken off the list before talks to reopen embassies could begin.
In a statement the State Department said it will host a Cuban delegation on 21 May.
"A US Embassy in Havana will allow the United States to more effectively promote our interests and values, and increase engagement with the Cuban people."
In April, President Barack Obama met Cuban President Raul Castro, the first sit-down talks between the nations' leaders since 1956.
