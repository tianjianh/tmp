Coastguards believe they have located the wreck of a missing fishing boat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A search was launched for the scalloper JMT after the father of one of its two crewmen raised the alarm when it failed to return to Plymouth on Thursday.
A sunken vessel, which coastguards believe to be the 11m (36ft) JMT, has been found 53m underwater, five miles north of the Eddystone Lighthouse.
The incident has been referred to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch to investigate.
On Friday, the body of one of the fishermen was recovered and the search for the second crew member was called off.
