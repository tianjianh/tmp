Wayne Rooney wants the Football Association to extend Roy Hodgson's reign as England boss after Euro 2016.

The 68-year-old has been in charge for four years and his contract expires at the end of this tournament.
FA chairman Greg Dyke told the BBC's Sportsweek that Hodgson's deal would be discussed after the Euros but would be renewed if England "do well".
"It is down to his bosses but of course, as players, we want him to stay," said Rooney.
England play Slovakia in Saint-Etienne on Monday knowing a point will ensure their place in the last 16 in France, with Hodgson reportedly planning to make six changes to his starting line-up from the team that beat Wales 2-1.
Captain Rooney is expected to be rested, along with Harry Kane, Dele Alli, Raheem Sterling, Kyle Walker and Danny Rose. Daniel Sturridge, Jamie Vardy, Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere, Nathaniel Clyne and Ryan Bertrand are likely to start.
Dyke appeared to suggest a place in the quarter-finals would be enough to keep Hodgson in his job, depending on the manner in which it was achieved, adding: "Clearly if you get to the semi-finals that's success."
Rooney, 30, delivered strong backing for Hodgson, citing the manner in which he has introduced youngsters such as Tottenham's Alli and Kane into the team, as well as giving debuts to Everton pair John Stones and Ross Barkley along with Manchester City's Sterling.
"It shouldn't go unnoticed the amount of young players he's introduced into the squad over the last four years," said Rooney.
"There was a big issue in terms of everyone saying we didn't have the young players coming through in England which other countries had. In fairness to the Premier League clubs they've brought young players through and Roy has picked them.
"In my opinion he has not only created a very good team but also a fantastic atmosphere around the training ground when we meet up, and a great base for England's future in the next six to eight years."
Rooney revealed he and other senior players also have a close, open relationship with Hodgson, who is taking charge of his third major tournament after Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine then the World Cup in Brazil in 2014.
Hodgson is under pressure to deliver in France after England failed to get out of the group stage in Brazil, effectively being eliminated after two games, defeats by Italy and Uruguay.
Rooney has formed a bond with Hodgson, saying: "It is important as captain you have a good relationship with the manager and of course we keep in touch outside of when we meet up [as a squad]."
Hodgson was informed of Dyke's comments on the bus on the way to training in Saint-Etienne on Sunday before the meeting with Slovakia.
He said: "I haven't seen what he has said. People are entitled to their opinion and it doesn't bother me.
"As far as I am concerned I am enjoying the tournament, I'm enjoying working with the players. I'm enjoying watching the team play.
"I shall continue to do that until such time as the FA say 'we don't need you any more, we're employing somebody else' and then I'll move on."

Asked whether the timing of Dyke's comments was poor and unhelpful mid-tournament, Hodgson said: "You're talking to the wrong man aren't you? I don't decide what other people do or what other people say. Do you think I should decide on what my boss does?
"The fact is my boss will do what my boss wants to do and I will, as an employee, work as an employee until such time as I'm no longer needed as an employee. That is a simple fact of the matter and we move on from there.
"I've really got nothing else to say. I'm not going to give you some sort of insight and I'm not going to give you some sort of headlines because there is no headline to give."
