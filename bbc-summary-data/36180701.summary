[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swindon Town 3-0 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicky Ajose scored twice to help Swindon register a second win in three games as they beat Shrewsbury Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ajose calmly slotted home an early penalty after Zak Whitbread fouled Nathan Thompson in the air.
The striker sliced Ellis Iandolo's lay-off into the bottom corner after the break for his 25th goal of the season.
Larnell Cole came close for Shrewsbury but his shot was blocked, before Jordan Young slid past teenage keeper Callum Burton to score his first Swindon goal.
Former England Under-18 keeper Burton, who spent time out on loan last season at Nuneaton and Southport, was making his Football League debut for Shrewsbury at the age of 19, while fellow Academy graduate Ethan Jones came off the bench.
Swindon, who were beaten play-off finalists in 2014-15, finished 16th in League One, a drop of 12 places from last season.
Shrewsbury - in their first season back in the third tier after being promoted last term - ended four points above the relegation zone in 20th after their sixth defeat in eight games.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"It is great to get the young boys on their way. It's good news for the club. They deserved their chance. Both of them can be pleased with their contribution.
"A rash attempt to clear the ball meant that, all of a sudden, just before half time we were a goal down.
"It's just the story of the whole season. We know that throughout the game as a team we haven't defended well enough. We gave away crazy goals."
