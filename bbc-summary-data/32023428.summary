Local politicians and health experts have devised a "Plan B" to retain doctor-led services at Glan Clwyd, Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board confirmed it was considering the plans.
Two weeks ago, 350 people had a meeting with health officials to air concerns.
It was organised by local Assembly Members Darren Millar and Ann Jones who have since held a further meeting with consultants and health board medical officials to draw up a revised plan.
The health board's original plans would see clinical staff transferred to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor and Wrexham Maelor hospitals from 6 April.
It said the temporary measure was due to staffing issues and the consultant-led maternity service would return to Glan Clwyd Hospital within 18 months.
But on Monday evening it confirmed a revised plan was now being considered.
