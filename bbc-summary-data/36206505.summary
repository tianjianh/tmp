Voters were asked to choose first and second preferences for mayor, and two types of London Assembly member - one for their area and one for the city.
Of the votes for the city, UKIP gained two seats while both the Conservatives and Lib Dems lost one each.
The 11 members voted in are:
The best performing of the smaller parties was the Women's Equality Party.
Party leader Sophie Walker said Mr Khan would have to focus on the gender pay gap in London.
"We opened our doors to membership 10 months ago and look where we are now. We are here for good.
"We set ourselves up to make real change, and to force the other parties to make real change."
The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment and housing and planning.
Along with the mayor, the London Assembly make up the Greater London Authority.
The London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies and it must be consulted over the Greater London Authority budget.
It can reject mayoral policies or amend the draft budget if two-thirds of its members agree to do so.
