New law makes 'scores on the doors' stickers mandatory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
From Friday food businesses in Northern Ireland are required by law to display their Food Standards Agency stickers to the public.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Food Hygiene Rating Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 means that the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme is now mandatory.
This system replaces a voluntary scheme that has been run since the end of 2011.
District councils will carry out inspections and businesses must have stickers in public view.
Scores will range from '5', which means the food hygiene standards are very good, down to '0' where urgent improvement is necessary.
The new stickers will be displayed at restaurants, pubs, cafes, takeaways, supermarkets and other food shops as well as hospitals, care homes and schools.
Health Minister Michelle O'Neill said: "I am delighted to see the Food Hygiene Rating Act, which was passed by the assembly in December last year, coming into operation today introducing the requirement for food businesses to display their hygiene ratings."
She added "With display rates remaining low it was clear that legislation was required to ensure that all businesses provide this information."
The FSA's Michael Jackson believes the new system will help to improve food hygiene standards across Northern Ireland.
"The mandatory display will encourage businesses with a poor rating to improve their standards and strive for a better rating," he said.
"Any food business should be able to achieve and maintain a 5 rating as it only requires compliance with hygiene requirements set down in law."
He added "If you can't see the sticker, then ask the staff. Under the act staff must tell you the rating if asked."
Next year as a result of a further regulation, businesses which offer online ordering of food will need to publish their rating online so it can be seen before an order is placed.
Ratings can also be checked on the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme website.
It is anticipated that 90% of food businesses within scope of the scheme will be displaying the sticker within the next two months.
When any food business is inspected by a food safety officer from the district council they are checked and assessed on how the business meets the requirements set down in food hygiene regulations
This comprises three elements:
Findings from each of these elements are taken together and result in the food hygiene rating given. A low rating means that there are serious failings.
