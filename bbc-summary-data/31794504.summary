Guernsey patients face further delays after CT scanner fault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People waiting for a CT scan in Guernsey face further delays after the island's scanner developed a second fault within a week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Evans, deputy chief officer of the Health and Social Services Department, said appointments would be re-booked as soon as possible.
The scanner first developed a fault last Wednesday and was repaired on Friday but the fault has re-appeared.
Mr Evans said he hoped to get engineers over as soon as possible to repair it.
The CT scanner is used for whole body imaging and diagnostic investigations, as well as to assess patients who have suffered head injuries.
There were 25 patients affected by the fault last week, with a further 16 appointments now disrupted.
Mr Evans said people needing an urgent scan would be sent to Southampton.
He said: "The current fault developed late on Saturday. At this stage, unfortunately, it looks as if it is a repeat of last week's issue.
"The CT scanner is maintained and serviced under a full service contract with the manufacturer."
