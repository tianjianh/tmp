Ovingham road bridge to reopen after £3m refurbishment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Northumberland road bridge that has been closed for nearly 18 months for essential repairs is set to reopen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ovingham Bridge, which links the village with Prudhoe across the River Tyne, closed in June 2014 for a £3m refurbishment to be carried out.
The single-lane steel and timber structure, which was built in 1883, carries about 5,000 vehicles a day.
An Ovingham Parish Council spokesman said it was "remarkable" the bridge could still handle today's traffic.
The refurbishment of the existing roadway and lattice trusses is expected to extend the bridge's use for 30 years, the council said.
The bridge is to reopen on Thursday.
