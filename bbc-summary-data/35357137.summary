Two yachtsmen say they have been rescued by lifeboat crews seven times since July as they attempt to travel from Scandinavia to North America.

Bob Weise and Steve Shapiro, both 71, left Norway in July and have had to call rescue teams in Norway, Denmark, Scotland, Ireland and Cornwall.
They were most recently assisted on Tuesday when their vessel was towed into St Ives harbour, Cornwall.
The pair said the rescues had nothing to do with "seamanship".
Some fishermen have doubted their competence and experience but the two men said they have just had bad luck.
Mr Shapiro, a screenwriter and author, said he had been sailing since he was nine years old.
He added the boat was "very safe and sturdy".
Fisherman Grant Lorris, from St Ives, said the ordeal had annoyed him as anyone could buy a boat and "not have a clue what they're doing".
Mr Weise, an ex-US Army helicopter pilot, said: "We're fit, and when we come ashore people say 'can we help you?' like we're infirm, but I can understand their concern."
Their boat, Nora, is being repaired in St Ives after suffering from a broken propeller shaft and battery problems.
A spokeswoman from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "The UK Coastguard has responded on two occasions over the last three days to assist the crew of the Nora.
"The crew and their vessel were brought to a place of safety near St Ives.
"However, it is the responsibility of the crew to undertake the necessary repairs to safely prepare them for the next stage of their journey."
The pair, both from North America, said when their boat was repaired they planned to continue their voyage.
