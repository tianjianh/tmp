Forensic evidence linking Jay Jay Kirton, 24, to the crime was found on the steering wheel and gear stick.
He and Richard Cameron, 30, had previously admitted the robbery using knives at DSG Stores, in Bankhead Road, in June last year.
Cameron was jailed for three years and six months.
Kirkton also pleaded guilty to stealing the car involved in the crime, which saw them make off with money and cigarettes.
Sentencing them at the High Court in Paisley, Judge Lord Ericht said it was  "a terrifying robbery carried out with knives".
Both had their jail terms reduced because they admitted their guilt.
Police Scotland welcomed the sentencing for what was described as a "calculated and brazen crime".
Det Ch Insp Matt Mackay said: "Thankfully no-one was injured, however the ordeal would have been terrifying for the young shop worker involved. It was only through luck and good fortune that she wasn't seriously injured or worse.
"I hope this serves as a warning to other offenders that such crime will not be tolerated. Any offences will be robustly investigated to ensure those responsible are brought to justice and that the public are kept safe."
