[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sylvan Parry guilty of trying to kill wife on school run

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who attacked his wife in the street while they walked their three children to school has been found guilty of attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sylvan Parry, 46, of Caernarfon, Gwynedd, denied trying to kill Fiona Parry on 3 September.
But a jury at Mold Crown Court found him guilty by a majority of 10 to two, on Thursday.
Judge Eleri Rees directed that jurors could give a majority verdict after two hours and 15 minutes of deliberations.
She added that Parry would be sentenced on Friday.
Mother-of-six, Mrs Parry, suffered life-changing injuries in the attack.
Speaking outside court, following the verdict, she said: "I hope he does get a life sentence for what he has done to me."
The prosecution earlier told the court Mr Parry used "considerable force" and only stopped when on-duty fire officers who had witnessed the attack intervened.
Witnesses saw him kick her "like a footballer taking a penalty" and he had to be stopped from stamping on her head.
Prosecuting barrister Sion ap Mihangel said: "This was clearly an attempt by this defendant to kill his wife. It was only because of the intervention of others that he did not succeed in killing her."
The incident happened on the first day of the new school term.
As the couple made the short walk from their house with their baby in a pram and two children, Mr Parry started behaving "aggressively" and issued threats to his wife before attacking her, Mr ap Mihangel told the court.
In a video interview, Mrs Parry told police she could not remember anything that happened that day because of a brain injury sustained during the attack.
Mr Parry said he had "lost it" in a "moment of madness" but did not intend to kill her. The jury was also told he was "deeply ashamed" by his actions.
He admitted wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm but he was found guilty of the more serious offence.
