A new £50m ferry serving Poole for the Channel Islands has been damaged while attempting to dock in Guernsey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Condor Liberation struck the quayside at St Peter Port, in windy conditions, on Saturday afternoon.
In a statement, the company said the vessel suffered "minor damage above the waterline" and as a result, would be out of action for a couple of days.
No-one was injured but some passengers remain on Guernsey as alternative travel arrangements are made for them.
While Condor Liberation under goes repairs in Poole, Dorset, the Commodore Clipper will provide passenger services between the UK and the Channel Islands.
Sunday's sailings had already been cancelled due to forecast bad weather.
Condor Liberation completed its maiden voyage to Jersey on Friday.
The 102m (335ft) long vessel was built by Austal shipbuilders in Australia and can carry up to 880 passengers and 245 vehicles.
It is now the only fast ferry operating between Guernsey, Jersey and the UK.
Following its purchase, the firm sold the smaller Vitesse and Express ferries to Greek company Seajets, with Vitesse already delivered and Express due to follow once Condor Ferries is happy with the new ferry in service.
The Liberation is supposed to be able to operate in bigger waves than the smaller ferries, but is not yet licensed to do so.
The bigger ferry cannot operate to Weymouth so sailings to the UK port ended on Monday.
