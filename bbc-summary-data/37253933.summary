She is believed to have been walking her dog on Devenish Island on Lower Lough Erne when the attack happened.
The woman, thought to be a tourist, was taken to the South West Acute hospital in Enniskillen and later transferred to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
A relative said she had undergone surgery on her colon and back.
It is believed the woman was hurt after trying to save her dog from being attacked by the cattle.
A spokesperson for the Belfast Trust said on Friday afternoon that the patient was now in a stable condition.
The rescue operation involved the Irish Coastguard helicopter from County Sligo and a lifeboat from Enniskillen.
"It was deemed that Rescue 118, Sligo's Coastguard helicopter, was needed to transport the lady," said the RNLI's Stephen Ingram.
A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities said: "The incident occurred on private land.
"The department is involved with discussions with relevant authorities and the landowner to ascertain exactly what happened."
The Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland said it was "aware of an incident in County Fermanagh involving cattle in which a member of the public was injured" and was investigating the matter.
The dog was taken to a vet but died of its injuries.
