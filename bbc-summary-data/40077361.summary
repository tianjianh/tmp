Brundle, who can also play as a full-back, made 34 league appearances for the Heed last season.
The 22-year-old joined Gateshead in June 2016, having previously played for Braintree, Bristol City and Yeovil.
Brundle is Dover's second new signing of the summer, following the arrival of Southport striker Jamie Allen.
