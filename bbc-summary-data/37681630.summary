[SN]TITLE[SN]
AC Milan 1-0 Juventus

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manuel Locatelli's goal helped AC Milan beat Juventus for the first time since November 2012 and close the gap at the top of Serie A to two points.

The 18-year-old midfielder struck a spectacular, powerful effort from the edge of the box into the top corner.
Earlier, Juve thought they had taken the lead when Miralem Pjanic's long-range free-kick went into the net.
After a lengthy delay, as the officials discussed whether a Juventus player was offside, it was disallowed.
Juventus piled on the pressure in the second half and almost equalised with the last kick of the game.
German midfielder Sami Khedira unleashed a long-range effort which looked destined for the top corner only for 17-year-old Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to produce a spectacular one-hand diving save.
Juventus have won the past five Serie A titles and are favourites to lift the Scudetto again this season, although AC Milan should not be underestimated.
Vincenzo Montella's side may lack the big name stars of the past but have young hungry players like Donnarumma, Suso and Locatelli.
If they had lost this game Milan would have been five points behind Juve. Instead they are two points behind and brimming with a confidence.
Sustaining a title challenge would be a big task for the Rossoneri but against Juve, backed by a vociferous San Siro crowd, they showed the kind of determination to suggest their resurgence is not a flash in the pan.
