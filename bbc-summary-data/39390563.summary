[SN]TITLE[SN]
Woking 2-1 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gozie Ugwu's late strike secured Woking an important National League win over Sutton at Kingfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Delano Sam-Yorke gave the hosts a dream start, grabbing his fourth goal in three games with a powerful header which gave Sutton goalkeeper Will Puddy no chance.
Jamie Collins headed against a post as the visitors grew into the contest, before Kieron Cadogan equalised in bizarre circumstances when Terell Thomas' attempted clearance flew in off the Sutton winger.
But Ugwu then collected the rebound from his own initial shot to fire in the winner with seven minutes remaining to take Woking out of the National League relegation zone.
