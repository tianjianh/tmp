A passenger on an Easyjet aircraft at Gatwick Airport was Tasered by police shortly before the plane was due to take off for Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers boarded the plane at about 08:00 BST following reports a passenger had become abusive in an argument over luggage.
Sussex Police said a 37-year-old man had been arrested and detained under the Mental Health Act.
Witness statements were taken from passengers and crew on the plane.
A police spokesman said the man, from Belfast, was arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace and obstructing/resisting a constable in the execution of their duty.
Following an examination by doctors, he was detained under the Mental Health Act for admission to a psychiatric unit for further assessment and treatment, Sussex Police added.
In a statement, Easyjet said police were called to the aircraft "due to a passenger behaving disruptively".
Niall Copeland tweeted: "Man getting arrested on @easyJet flight home to #Belfast because he wants 2 pieces of hand luggage!"
He then posted: "All because he was insistent of wearing his man purse."
The other passengers were taken off the plane following the arrest, police said.
Gary Trainor tweeted: "Back in the departure lounge after a man was tasered on my flight in a baggage dispute! #gatwick #easyjet"
Flight EZY831 was delayed by just over two-and-a-half hours and the plane took off just before 10:55.
