The visit is part of a series of events taking place to mark Glasgow being the first ever "Partner City to The Open".
The title recognises Glasgow's status as a transport and accommodation hub for the event from 10-17 July.
Organisers of The Open estimate that the championship could be worth up to Â£100m to the Scottish economy.
Johnnie Cole-Hamilton, executive director of championships at The R&A said: "We are delighted to have Glasgow as the first Partner City of The Open and there is a great deal going on to celebrate the return of one of the world's great sporting events to Royal Troon just down the coast in South Ayrshire."
The Claret Jug, which was won at St Andrews last year by the USA's Zach Johnson, has been presented to the winner of The Open since 1873.
It was received on the runway of Glasgow Airport by airfield operations manager Billy Hill.
It was then placed on public display in The Open shop in the main terminal building.
Francois Bourienne, commercial director at Glasgow Airport, said: "It is an absolute honour to welcome one of the most famous trophies in world sport to Glasgow Airport.
"The Open will attract tens of thousands of visitors from across the world and a number of our airline partners have added extra capacity in order to meet demand."
