Hull City 0-2 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Xherdan Shaqiri scored twice, including a stunning 25-yard strike, as Stoke comfortably won at Hull to move out of the relegation zone.

The Switzerland midfielder cut inside on his left foot and found the top right corner with a sublime finish.
He doubled the lead with a free-kick from the edge of the area just after half-time.
The result sees Mike Phelan's side drop into the bottom three, after a fifth consecutive Premier League defeat.
The game ended on a strange note as Shaqiri appeared to grab Sam Clucas by the throat after being pushed by the full-back. Stoke trio Shaqiri, Phil Bardsley and Joe Allen were then all booked after the final whistle.
Stoke's first away victory of the season also brings them back-to-back Premier League wins for the first time since March - and moves them to 16th place on nine points.
Hull, meanwhile, have conceded 19 goals in their past five league games and are without a league win since 20 August.
Shaqiri's goals were two moments of magic in a match largely unmemorable otherwise.
The 25-year-old's past four Premier League goals have all come from outside the box and his two against Hull were his first since the opening day of the season.
His first came from his own corner, which was cleared by Hull as far as Ryan Shawcross, who passed the ball back to Shaqiri.
The former Bayern Munich winger then cut inside before unleashing a curling 25-yard shot, which left David Marshall no chance in the Hull goal.
He then won the free-kick for his second on 49 minutes and stepped up to send the ball over the wall and into the bottom right corner, beyond Marshall.
Shaqiri also created wonderful chances for Marko Arnautovic and Wilfried Bony, having three shots in all and making five key passes in the match.
Former England midfielder Danny Murphy on Match of the Day:
"Xherdan Shaqiri hasn't done enough of this in a Stoke shirt. He was outstanding. He had that strut around him and produced moments of brilliance. His first goal was unstoppable.
"He's got the ability to open up defences from anywhere on the pitch - not many players can do that. If he can stay fit, along with Joe Allen and Marko Arnautovic,  then Stoke will be up the table before you know it."
The optimism of Hull's wins in the first two games of the season has faded at the KCOM Stadium, where plenty of empty seats could be seen among a crowd of only 18,522.
The hosts did not manage a shot on target until Abel Hernandez came on after 55 minutes.
Their best attacking efforts came with the game already won for Stoke and the home side still struggled in front of goal despite their late burst.
Stoke dominated the midfield, with Shaqiri and Arnautovic given too much space.
Hull also had returning captain Michael Dawson to thank for some crucial tackles. Playing in his first game of the season after a knee injury the 32-year-old stopped Bony and Shaqiri from scoring in the first half.
Phelan, upgraded from his caretaker role nine days ago, is yet to taste victory since and will have his work cut out to address the slide in form - something not helped by Robert Snodgrass limping off with an ankle injury late on.

Hull boss Mike Phelan: "We were edgy and we gave the ball away too easily. There are lessons to be learned by all of us.
"We are under no illusions and we shouldn't be. We need to rebuild confidence and set our sights for the battle ahead. We need to do more. We are not here to lie down and let teams beat us.
"Robert Snodgrass got stood on - he's got a bruised ankle and we will assess that in the morning."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "Xherdan Shaqiri missed some games but since he came back he's been really positive and we are really pleased with him.
"We have been playing well for a number of weeks. We are building performances. From start to finish we were in control.
"People questioned us at the beginning but now we are allowing people to see our level.
"I didn't see what happened after full-time - there were afters from both sides."
