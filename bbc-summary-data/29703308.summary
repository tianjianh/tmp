Ed Sheeran has dealt pretty well with a festival boss calling him "boring".

Speaking at the Live UK Summit 2014 panel last week, Isle Of Wight Festival organiser John Giddings said he was worried the industry wasn't nurturing enough new acts with the potential to headline festivals.
"We're not building headliners any more," he said, according to the website Virtual Festivals.
"And if boring acts like Ed Sheeran are the future then we're all screwed."
However, the singer was quick to point out that he had been asked to play at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2015 but had already been booked.
This summer's Isle Of Wight Festival was headlined by Biffy Clyro, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kings Of Leon.
It's not yet known who will play at the event in 2015 but Giddings has ruled out rumours that Foo Fighters would be headlining.
When asked on Twitter if the band would be playing, he replied: "I wish I could they said no - sorry."
