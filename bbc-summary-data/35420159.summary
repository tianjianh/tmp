Detective Adrian Goldsmith trial: Wife 'tried to defend herself'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman beaten to death by her detective husband suffered more than 70 injuries, some while in a foetal position trying to defend herself, a jury has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Prosecutor John Lloyd QC said Jill Goldsmith's wounds proved she was murdered at their home next to Northamptonshire Police HQ in March.
Adrian Goldsmith, 49, admits causing fatal injuries but denies murder.
He has told Stafford Crown Court his actions were in self defence.
The jury has heard he came home to find his wife waiting for him, and that she came at him with a knife.
He claimed he hit her with a variety of objects because she was attacking him, and had attacked him on previous occasions.
Mrs Goldsmith, also 49, was found with multiple head wounds in a pool of blood.
In closing arguments, Mr Lloyd QC asked the jury to reject any claims of self defence.
The jury heard a letter written by Mr Goldsmith, in which he said his wife compared him to Jekyll and Hyde.
Mr Lloyd said he agreed with the statement, and Mr Goldsmith was a "commended, hardworking officer and, we say, murderer all wrapped up in one".
The trial continues.
