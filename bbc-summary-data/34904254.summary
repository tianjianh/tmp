Podmore, 21, made five appearances in the T20 Blast this season and took 42 wickets for the north London club's second XI.
Helm, 21, took seven wickets in the first two County Championship matches this season but was then sidelined by a back injury.
Middlesex have not disclosed the length of the duo's new deals.
"In Harry and Tom, Middlesex are fortunate to have two extremely talented and exciting young fast bowlers," managing director of cricket Angus Fraser said.
"If the pair of them continue to work hard, remain fit and strong and develop as they have, they will be a major part of our plans for many years to come."
