Newport County: Club release Jack Jebb and Josh O'Hanlon after short-term deals end

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County have released midfielder Jack Jebb and forward Josh O'Hanlon following the end of their short-term deals with the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Arsenal player Jebb, 21, made seven appearances for the Exiles since making his debut in November.
21-year-old O'Hanlon turned out 10 times for the club, including seven starts, but failed to find the net.
Newport are five points adrift at the bottom of League Two and have lost their last eight league games in a row.
Loanees Reece Grego Cox, Rhys Healey, Jordan Green and Kyle Cameron have all returned to their respective clubs, while Jon Parkin has completed a permanent move to York, meaning Newport have signed six first-team players and seen seven depart since the transfer window opened on 1 January.
