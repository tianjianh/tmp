Jordon Begley: Taser review ordered after Manchester man's inquest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent review has been ordered into the safety of Tasers deployed by police to control suspects.

An inquest jury earlier this week found the use of a Taser to restrain Jordon Begley was a factor in the 23-year-old's death in Manchester in 2013.
Jurors concluded police had fired the stun gun at him "inappropriately and unreasonably" at a house in Gorton.
The National Police Chiefs' Council said it "raises some concern" about the devices, fired 1,724 times in 2014.
Factory worker Mr Begley died in hospital two hours after being hit by a Taser when police were called to his home during a row with neighbours on 10 July 2013.
The inquest in Manchester found that the use of the 50,000-volt weapon and his restraint by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officers had "more than materially contributed" to a package of stressful factors leading to factory worker Mr Begley's death later from a cardiac arrest.
The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) has asked for an independent analysis of the medical evidence in the case to decide whether safety advice about the weapons needs to be amended.
Monday's landmark verdict is believed to be the first time a UK jury has found that a Taser contributed to somebody's death.
GMP Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley said she had decided to restrict the operational duties of the officers involved.
Tasers were used 10,062 times in 2014, an increase from 6,649 in 2010, but marginally down from 10,380 in 2013.
Officers used the highest "fired" setting, which sends an electric shock which incapacitates the victim, 1,724 times last year. The stun setting, which only sends out painful shocks, was used 256 times.
Police in London use Tasers more than any other force, with 1,962 uses last year, with officers triggering the most powerful "fire" shot 219 times.
The West Midlands was next with 1,573 uses, and the North West - which includes Greater Manchester Police - was third with 1,447.
Police in the North East resorted to the stun gun the least, using it 252 times.
Amnesty International spokesman Oliver Sprague branded the increased use of Tasers as "extremely worrying".
He said: "We need more clarity on how and why these weapons are used. The statistics on their own tell us nothing about whether they are used correctly or not. Without such detail, these figures are not fit for purpose.
"The precise circumstances over when a Taser is drawn or discharged can be - quite literally - a matter of life and death.
"We're not saying that Taser doesn't have a role to play but it must be considered as a weapon of last resort."
Policing Minister Mike Penning said: "The government is clear that any use of Tasers must be lawful, proportionate and necessary in all the circumstances.
"This data makes the police's use of Taser and firearms more transparent and allows the public to see how these sensitive powers are being used.
"We welcome the NPCC's decision to ask [for a] review [of] medical assessments. There is no suggestion that their current assessment is outdated but it should be refreshed in light of recent cases so that it supports operational guidance and training."
