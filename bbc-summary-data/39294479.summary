Cameron suffered a cardiac arrest at Pil Primary School in January and stopped breathing.
Staff administered CPR before paramedics took him to hospital.
Paula Rowlands, Cheryl Rowlands, Karen Flower-Robbins, Sarah Wallace and head teacher Neil Pryce were presented with a mayor's citizenship award.
Mr Pryce said: "I can't praise the staff enough for their response in dealing with very a serious and life threatening situation. I am immensely proud of their actions on the day.
"A small number of staff administered CPR, while others ensured that all children were cared for sensitively and given reassurance."
The five were given the award in a ceremony on Friday.
After arriving on the scene, paramedics stabilised Cameron before he was taken to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.
He was later transferred to a hospital in Bristol where a device was fitted in his chest to treat any dangerously abnormal heart rhythms.
Cameron was back at school six weeks after collapsing.
Paramedic Steve Smith said: "We were just so happy to see Cameron back in school after such a short time.
"Although we were on the scene within minutes of the call, those minutes that the teachers carried out CPR saved his life really."
