The Australian moved to the Super League club this season after a 15-year career at Newcastle Knights.
Gidley has spent much of his time at full-back so far and has scored 94 points in his 10 appearances.
"I'm excited to be staying for another year. My plan was always to play for two years," the 33-year-old told the Warrington website.
"It's been really enjoyable for the short time we've been here so far and we are looking forward to staying longer."
Wire head coach Tony Smith added: "He's already shown his experience, knowledge and temperament. His professionalism off the field has been fantastic as well as on the field."
