After an even first 30 minutes, Danny Wright tapped in from James Dayton's free-kick to put the Robins in front.
But Tubbs levelled after the restart, latching onto Maxime Biamou's header and slotting in from 10 yards out.
Robert Dickie headed against the bar for the Robins late on, before Deacon fired in to win the game in added time.
Sutton have won just one of their past eight games in the National League - including a 6-0 home defeat by Dover on Tuesday - but Deacon's late heroics earned them a place in third round for the first time in 22 years.
The U's have twice gone even further in the competition, reaching the fourth round in 1970, and again in 1989 after they famously beat First Division Coventry City in round three.
They will receive Â£27,000 for getting through the second round, and could earn a lucrative tie with Premier League or Championship opposition when the third round draw takes place on Monday.
