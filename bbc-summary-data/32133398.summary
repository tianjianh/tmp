William Kerr, 53, is wanted by police after he absconded from a bail hostel in Hull following his release on 23 January.
He was jailed for life for murder at Leeds Crown Court in June 1998.
North Yorkshire Police said Kerr was known to have links to the Humberside Police force area, as well as West Yorkshire and London.
A spokesperson for the force said his current whereabouts were unknown and he needed to be arrested and returned to prison "as a matter of urgency".
Police issued a recent photo of Kerr and urged people to "keep an eye out for him".
Det Insp Eamonn Clarke said: "We ask that you do not approach Kerr, as he is considered dangerous. You should contact the police straight away on 999 and officers will be despatched to arrest him or investigate the sighting."
Det Insp Clarke also urged Kerr "to do the right thing and hand yourself in to the police".
North Yorkshire Police said it was leading the hunt for Kerr as his probation officer was based in Selby but there was "no evidence at this time to suggest that he is currently in North Yorkshire".
