[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh rugby chief Roger Lewis to run Cardiff Airport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh rugby chief Roger Lewis is to be the new chairman of Cardiff Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is leaving his post as Welsh Rugby Union group chief executive in October after the World Cup and will replace Lord Rowe-Beddoe.
Transport Minister Edwina Hart said he was "the right person to steer our future ambitions" at the airport, which the Welsh government bought in 2013.
Mr Lewis said he was "thrilled" to be offered the job, saying the airport was "crucial" to the economy of Wales.
He has been at the helm of Welsh rugby since 2006, following a 30-year career in the music and media industries.
