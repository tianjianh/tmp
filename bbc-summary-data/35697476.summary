The card allows passengers to make bookings from home and avoid queuing at stations.
At present it can only be used on four routes in the central belt.
ScotRail is also in discussion with other operators to pave the way for the smartcard to be used on other transport systems including buses and ferries.
By the end of the summer the smartcard system will be available on on all of ScotRail's 28 routes.
The company is hoping that by 2019, 60% of rail journeys in Scotland will be ticketless.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: "Our customers tell us that one of the biggest hassles they face when travelling is having to queue up for a ticket either before or after they get on the train.
"By the end of the summer, season ticket holders the length and breadth of Scotland will be able to buy their season tickets at home or at one of our at-station ticket machines, load them up onto their smartcard and then just tap and go."
