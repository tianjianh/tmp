The Nevis Range ski resort had its busiest day for 10 years on Sunday.

Almost 1,700 skiers and snowboarders took to the slopes of Aonach Mor and snow cover was described as "wall-to-wall".
The resort was not even able to operate all of its lifts because some were still buried under the unprecedented amounts of snow.
The managing director of the resort said it had snowed every day since 20 December.
Marian Austin said: "We knew Sunday was going to be an incredible day on the slopes as we already had unprecedented levels of snow and the forecast was for sunny spells and favourable winds.
"Despite not being able to open all of our lifts on such a busy day, we've had great feedback from our customers.
"This is due to the strong team of staff we have here at Nevis Range. All of our staff have been working very hard in difficult conditions and the hill team have been digging out the lifts on the upper mountain almost on a daily basis."
She added that with the amount of snow which had already fallen there was a good chance the season could last until late spring or even summer.
