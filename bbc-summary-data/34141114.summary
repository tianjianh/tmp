[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Newman, 48, of Christchurch Road, Bournemouth was caught in a police sting operation while making plans to sexually abuse minors.
He pleaded guilty to 12 counts and was sentenced at Dorchester Crown Court.
Police said the jail term was a "warning to anyone involved in downloading indecent images of children".
Newman was arrested in Bournemouth on 8 February and charged on 21 May.
It follows an extensive undercover operation relating to him attempting to meet a like-minded individual who he believed had access to young children he wanted to sexually abuse.
The court heard that on searching Newman's home, officers seized electronic devices containing indecent material of young children.
The equipment was found to contain four category A, 11 category B and 98 category C indecent moving and still images, with category A being the most serious.
Newman pleaded guilty on 16 July to 12 counts relating to possession and distribution of indecent images of children, arranging to meet a child to commit a sexual offence and possession of cannabis.
Det Con Paul Chessell, of Dorset Police's paedophile online investigation team, said: "I am pleased that a man who presented such a risk to members of the public is now behind bars".
