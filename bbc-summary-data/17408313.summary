Austria profile - Media

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Austria's public broadcaster, Oesterreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), has long-dominated the airwaves. It faces competition from private TV and radio broadcasters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cable or satellite TV is available in most Austrian homes and is often used to watch German stations, some of which tailor their output for local viewers.
A daily newspaper is a must for many Austrians. National and regional titles contest fiercely for readers.
Media ownership is highly concentrated, says US-based Freedom House. Libel and slander laws may be used to protect politicians and officials, the NGO adds.
Around 81% of Austrians were online by 2012 (ITU). Public broadcaster ORF operates one of the leading news websites.
