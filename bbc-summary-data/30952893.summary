Manchester United will give midfielder Darren Fletcher a free transfer so he can move to another club during the current transfer window.

The Scotland captain, 30, has made 342 appearances for United but has started only five times under Louis van Gaal.
Fletcher, whose contract expires this summer, has been linked with a move to either West Ham or West Brom.
He has been at Old Trafford since he was a schoolboy and helped them win the Premier League title five times.
West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has confirmed his interest in signing Fletcher but said his side "can't wait forever".
"When he makes his mind up everyone will know," added Allardyce. "I don't know what the timeline is. If any of the other packages offered to him are accepted then we would accept that."
