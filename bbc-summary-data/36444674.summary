Brazil captain Neymar, 24, whose contract expires in 2018, has been linked with several moves away from the Nou Camp, including to Real Madrid.
But Fernandez said: "He will stay. He will be here for a long time. The club will make it public when the extension is to be made."
Neymar scored 31 goals this season as Barcelona won a league and cup double.

Fernandez is also confident that defender Javier Mascherano will remain at the club.
The Argentine, who has two years remaining on his contract, has reportedly agreed a move to Italian champions Juventus.
"We will reach an agreement," said Fernandez. "He is a vital player for us and I don't have any doubts about whether he will stay."
Mascherano, 31, has been a regular for Barcelona since his arrival from Liverpool in 2010.
