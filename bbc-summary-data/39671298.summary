A man has been airlifted to hospital, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said.
Emergency services were alerted to the crash at about 15:20.
Road works are being carried out along a five mile (8km) stretch of the A9 between Kincraig and Dalraddy to upgrade the road to dual carriageway.
The A9 was closed for several hours before it was reopened.
Traffic Scotland said the A9 was closed in both directions around the scene of the accident.
The A9 was also closed for several hours between Pitlochry and Dunkeld because of an accident at the Kindallachan junction.
