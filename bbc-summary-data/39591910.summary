The Serie A club have been owned by former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi since 1986.
A new stadium is on the new owners' agenda, according to the club's general manager Marco Fassone.
"We want to give AC Milan a stadium in the short term," he said.
AC Milan and fierce rivals Inter Milan, also Chinese-owned, rent the 80,000-seat San Siro from Milan's city council.
"We know that in Italy it cannot happen straight away," added Fassone.
"Whether it's San Siro or a newly built stadium, as long as the club can have its own stadium."
AC Milan have not won Serie A since 2011 and finished seventh, 10th and eighth in the past three seasons.
They are sixth in the league, 20 points behind leaders Juventus.
