[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A taxi driver who had his car stolen and burnt out could face legal action if he fails to pay a bill from the fire service in the Republic of Ireland.

Michael Carr, originally from Londonderry, had his vehicle taken from outside his house in May last year.
It was found two days later in Buncrana, County Donegal, having been set on fire and abandoned.
Mr Carr was then sent a bill for over 1,400 euros (Â£1,008) for the fire service attending the incident.
The letter, from Donegal County Council, warned the taxi driver that it "will resort to legal enforcement where necessary in order to secure payment".
Mr Carr said he is "worried about the consequences" of not paying as he could not afford the amount being asked of him.
"I'm paying for someone else to come into my house, steal things from me, steal my vehicle - I feel I'm getting penalised for it," he told BBC Radio Foyle.
The car was stolen by thieves who had broken into Mr Carr's house in Muff, County Donegal, as he was asleep.
Police found the car burnt out two days later.
He later received the letter billing him a total of 1,443.21 euro (Â£1,039) for "fire charges".
Mr Carr is now receiving final reminders regarding the bill but says he does not see why he should have to pay it.
"It does hang over me - it's a lot of money and I can't really afford to pay it.
"Everybody at the minute struggles, and 1,400 euro is a lot of money to be handing anyone."
But the fire service at Donegal County Council said its authority to charge for vehicle fires is set out in Ireland's Fire Services Act.
It said the charge is normally the "full cost of the incident plus 30% to cover equipment, consumables and administration".
It added: "Where a person is on social welfare and also working part-time and no contribution has been received from the insurance company, the invoice may be reduced by 75%."
