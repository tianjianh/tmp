British world champion Fury, 28, claimed the WBO, WBA and IBF belts from the 40-year-old Ukrainian in November 2015, but pulled out of a July rematch with an ankle injury.
The fight is at Manchester Arena.
"I'm delighted that we can finally get the fight back on. We can now focus on giving the fans what they deserve," said Fury's manager and uncle Peter.
Klitschko was undefeated for 11 years and had held the belts since 2006 before losing to Fury in Dusseldorf on a unanimous points decision.
He tweeted: "Finally the rematch is fixed. I'll remedy my mistake on 29 October at Manchester Arena. See you there."
Manchester fighter Fury is unbeaten in 25 professional bouts, with 18 knock-outs, while Klitschko is 64-4, with 54 knock-outs.
Fury had originally held three of the world belts, but his IBF title was stripped from him soon after he won it when he failed to face his mandatory challenger.
British heavyweight Anthony Joshua is the current holder.

Fury also has a doping suspension hanging over him after being charged by the UK's anti-doping body (Ukad) in June, the same day he pulled out of the Klitschko rematch with injury.
Fury appealed and the provisional ban has been lifted pending a hearing in front of the independent National Anti-Doping Panel (NADP) at a later date.
The British fighter has said he will sue Ukad over its claims he used a banned drug.

The route to a rematch
It will be almost a year since the first fight by the time the two men face each other again. Here's what has been said:
"Shame on you, you let a fat man beat you. I don't even live an athlete's lifestyle. It's a disgrace to call me an athlete." Fury strips off at a news conference in April and claims he does not need to be in shape for their rematch.
"I'm not accepted in Britain because I'm a Gypsy and that will never change." In April, Fury says he will move to the US after the Klitschko rematch.
"I'm glad that my hand was not raised that night. Failure is not an option unless it is the only way to get better - and I had to get better." Klitschko tells BBC Radio 5 live in April that "losing felt good".
"I said some things which may have hurt some people - which as a Christian man is not something I would ever want to do," Fury apologises in May for making homophobic, sexist and anti-Semitic comments in an online video.
"When he got to the Jewish people he sounded like Hitler. The man is an imbecile." Klitschko responds to Fury's comments.
"One thing is also clear, this just means I'll get my belt a few weeks later." Klitschko after the rematch was postponed in June.
"There was no way Tyson could go into the fight against Wladimir Klitschko less than 100% fit." Fury's promoter Mick Hennessy on the same day.
"Unfortunately, Team Fury is trying to change the terms of an already-signed contract multiple times, and it is going on endlessly," Klitschko threatens the Fury team with court in August over ongoing fight negotiations.
