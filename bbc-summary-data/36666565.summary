The 31-year-old has been struggling with a broken bone in his foot for the past few months, as well as a shoulder problem.
"We've been going non-stop for a year so I'm looking forward to five weeks off," the Wasps captain told BBC Sport.
"I will enjoy the time off, but I'll be attached to an ice bag. I'll be ready."
Haskell was one of England's outstanding performers in the first two Tests, with his man-of-the-match display in the first game in Brisbane arguably the finest of his international career.
The supporters' player of the series says coach Eddie Jones' man-management has given him the confidence to deliver on the biggest stage.
"He's created an aspirational environment where people want to play," he said. "It's a very hard environment but also one where you smile and enjoy yourself.
"I've always been really interested in how people learn, how people receive feedback and people's body language. Eddie and his coaching staff are masters of that.
"You can't talk to all people the same way. You have to understand what motivates them and he does that really well."
The former Stade Francais, Ricoh Black Rams and Highlanders forward is one of England's senior players with 70 caps, and has benefited from a leadership role.
"The way Eddie and the other coaches have empowered the senior boys has been great," Haskell said. "I feel respected and listened to, which is key.
"I'm so hungry to improve, and if I can help other people and use some of the experiences I've had of playing all around the world to help, then that's what I try and do."
