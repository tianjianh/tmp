[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 2-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Norwood turned from zero to hero as his last-gasp winner earned Tranmere a victory at home to Eastleigh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norwood missed a penalty with 15 minutes left, but he made amends three minutes into stoppage time when he latched on to a through ball and tucked home a winner.
Connor Jennings had put Tranmere ahead in the 24th minute by slamming home from close range after Norwood's free-kick was parried by Ryan Huddart.
The lead lasted just six minutes as an unmarked Adam Dugdale swept home a loose ball.
After Lois Maynard was fouled by Luke Coulson in the area, Norwood cannoned his spot-kick off the crossbar, but his late strike made it three wins from three in the National League for Rovers.
