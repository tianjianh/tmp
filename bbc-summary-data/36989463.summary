Rhys Williams, from Bicester, said his car was targeted on Thursday night.
Mr Williams, who works for the Road Haulage Association, described people with chainsaws and Molotov cocktail bombs, trying to stop lorries passing the "Jungle" migrant camp.
The Freight Transport Association has called on the British and French governments to do more to ensure the safety of truck drivers.
