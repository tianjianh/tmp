So far this year, 23.5 million passengers have used the airport, surpassing its previous high in 2008.
The airport, which has been operating for 75 years, has direct flights to more than 170 destinations.
In recent years, it has been drawing more passengers from Northern Ireland.
Belfast International and George Belfast City Airport handle around four million and two million passengers annually.
"Dublin Airport is having a record year due to strong growth across all major sectors of the market," said its managing director Vincent Harrison.
He said passenger numbers had risen by 16% compared to last year.
In 2008, the airport handled 23 million passengers.
That number has been beaten with just over three weeks of the year remaining.
