The Old Bailey heard Daniel Green, of Walthamstow, attacked the woman in her 20s in the early hours of 16 May 2015 at StratX stockbrokers' offices near Monument.
The victim said she tried to get away but Green, 26, claimed it was consensual.
Green will be on the sexual offenders' register for an indefinite period.
The jury heard Green went back to the office with a group of people, including the victim, after the party where people were doing lines of cocaine, dancing on the tables and drinking champagne.
Most people went home after the mood soured over a stash of cocaine going missing.
The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was left in the office with Green, her friend and another employee.
The trial heard she went to sleep under a desk but woke to find Green tugging her trousers down.
She said: "At that point I remember just trying to crawl forward to get away. I knew what was going to happen. I remember being pulled back.
"The next thing I remember was Daniel raping me.
"He was making sexual noises, making me feel horrible, so I burst into tears."
Prosecutor Timothy Forster said Green had treated the woman like a "piece of meat".
In a victim impact statement read in court, the woman said: "I desperately want to forget about what happened, but I'm not able to and fear this is something which will continue to blight my life."
Sentencing, the judge said he was not punishing Green for "City culture of excessive drink and casual use of drugs when you go out socialising" but because he had shown no remorse and behaved with "a degree of arrogance" when giving evidence.
