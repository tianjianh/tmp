The 21-year-old has made just one senior appearance for the Rams, but has featured in three EFL Trophy matches for the Under-21s this season.
Brazilian-born Santos, a Bristol Rovers academy graduate, has also previously played on loan for Notts County.
"He's can play wide left or right, I think he'll excite one or two people," Eastleigh manager Ronnie Moore said.
"It's nice that we can draw someone here from a Championship club," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"There have been league clubs interested in him, who can't move for him until January, so we thought we would take advantage of the situation."
