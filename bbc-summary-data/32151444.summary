NHS funding: Public 'back tax rises for healthcare'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A majority of people in Britain support tax rises as a way of funding the NHS, a poll suggests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Ipsos MORI survey of nearly 1,800 people for the Health Foundation think tank found 85% thought the NHS should be protected from cuts - significantly more than other public services.
When presented with a range of options setting out how that could be achieved, 59% said they supported tax rises.
There was also some support for fining people for missing appointments.
But only 16% were in favour of charging for services, such as a Â£10 fee for GP appointments.
Funding of the NHS is already proving to be a major theme of the election campaign. The Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP and Greens have all promised extra funds for the health service.
This issue includes NHS funding, GP access and social care, particularly of older people.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
Richard Taunt, the Health Foundation's director of policy, said: "It's clear the public think the government should continue to support the principles of our NHS and want to see it protected from spending cuts."
But he said that would "inevitably involve some difficult decisions".
This was reflected by the fact that, while 85% said the NHS should be tax-funded, free at the point of use and providing comprehensive care, only 63% thought it would continue to be free by 2020.
Nearly one in three thought care had got worse in the past six months, but 51% said it had not really changed and 11% thought it had got better.
Opinion was divided over the use of the private sector, with 30% saying private sector involvement would make the health service better, 33% worse and 34% stay the same.
Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: "The underlying message is that the public want the NHS to continue to be protected by government, remain tax-funded and free for everyone - and with this the Patients Association agrees."
Separately, Dr Mark Porter, head of the British Medical Association, t told the Guardian whichever new government is formed after the general election will face a temptation to introduce charges and may not be deterred by the unpopularity of such a move.
"I think they will be tempted. They said in 1950 that a Labour government wouldn't introduce charging and it did," he said.
Dr Porter also said any future government "must resist" moves to introduce charges.
