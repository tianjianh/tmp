Gobinda Chinweefat, 26, was arrested near the scene of a burglary in Didsbury, Manchester, on Friday night.
A short time later, he complained of chest pains and police called an ambulance to take him to hospital.
While driving along Kingsway, Mr Chinweefat opened the ambulance doors and jumped out. Greater Manchester Police said he could be seriously hurt.
Det Insp Kevin Marriott said the ambulance had been travelling at between 20 and 30mph (40 to 48km/h) when Mr Chinweefat jumped out.
He landed on his back but immediately got up and ran away through a tunnel linking Kingsway to Brailsford Road.
"We are making every effort to find him," said Det Insp Marriott
"Mr Chinweefat was also complaining of chest pains and we are concerned that he may need medical attention for this or any injuries sustained in his escape.
"He is not to be approached by members of the public but if anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts, please contact GMP."
