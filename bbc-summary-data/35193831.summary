[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter missed out on the chance to go top of the Premiership after an error-filled encounter against Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The only try of the game came when Saints' hooker Mike Haywood went over from a driving maul after 17 minutes.
JJ Hanrahan kicked a penalty to give Northampton an 8-0 lead going into the break at Franklin's Gardens.
Exeter failed to take a number of chances in the Saints 22 after half-time and only got on the scoresheet with Gareth Steenson's late penalty.
Exeter remain in second place behind Saracens after getting a losing bonus point, while Saints stay fifth.
In an ugly encounter in front of a modern-day record crowd of 15,430, Saints defence did well to stifle Exeter, stopping the previously free-flowing Chiefs from getting much ball, especially in the first half.
Haywood crossed for the only try after Jamie Gibson gathered a line-out close to the Exeter try-line and the front-rower was forced over with the help of his team-mates.
Hanrahan hit the post with the conversion but found his mark nine minutes from half-time as Northampton's dominance in the scrum led to a penalty.
Hanrahan missed a chance to extend the lead just after the break and while Exeter had more ball, Saints doggedly forced turnovers every time Chiefs went close.
Steenson kicked a 74th-minute penalty for their only score of the game after winning a penalty at the breakdown, but it proved to be the final action of a dour game.
