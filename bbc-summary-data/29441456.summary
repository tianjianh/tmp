Six things that changed your life today (a bit)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Change, change, change".  That's always the message we get from politicians trying to convince us they're making our lives better.

But how often do you notice any real difference?
It might not feel like it but today some stuff in your life really has changed. Here's why.
If you own a car you probably know that sinking feeling when you realise you've forgotten to buy a new tax disc.
But, not from today. The tax disc is no longer that perforated bit of paper, it's gone digital. Will you remember?
Nineteen pence. Doesn't sound much, right? But of course the government is saying it's a big deal.
That's how much the National Minimum Wage has gone up, bringing the hourly rate to ??6.50 for most adults.
But wait, it's not that simple if you're under 20.
If you're 18-20 you'll only get a 10p rise. 16-17 year-olds? It's a 7p rise for you. And as for apprentices, you'll get five pence more an hour.
Be honest, how many times do you watch music videos because you fancy the singer who is hardly dressed for a rainy October day?
Well, the government has now decided they should be given age-ratings, just like films.
Both YouTube and Vevo have agreed to trial the scheme and the three biggest music labels in the UK have agreed to take part.
The classifications will only apply to acts signed to British labels and will only be enforced on new videos.
So don't worry under-18s, you can still watch Radio 1's very own Greg James on his wrecking ball for years to come...
For the men out there thinking about having children, you'll no longer be able to use "work" as an excuse to avoid your dad duties.
They're finally getting the go-ahead to take time off to attend antenatal classes; but only two of them, mind.
There have been pushes to increase paternity leave allowances, but parents can now share their combined leave however they see fit.
Finally, here's some better news for people dealing with the death of a loved one.
Sadly scientists haven't discovered the key to immortality, but lawmakers have at least made the post-death paperwork a bit more simple.
If you're married or in a civil partnership, your partner is now automatically entitled to all your money if you haven't made a will.
Previously if you were lucky enough to have more than ??45,000 in the bank they'd have to go through a drawn-out legal process to inherit your savings.
But now they'll get the lot once you're gone.  Comforting, right?
More good news for fans of Greg James on his wrecking ball; mash-ups are legal again!
What, you didn't know they were illegal?  Oh yeah, record labels have been moaning and getting them removed from YouTube for ages.
Apparently some people like Cassetteboy have been threatened with legal action but a new EU law means they're safe for now.
The best thing about this ruling isn't that we can all now watch "buttery biscuit base" again, oh no.
The best thing is that a judge now has to decide if your effort is funny enough to make it ok!
