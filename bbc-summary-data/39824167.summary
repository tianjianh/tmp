Health Concern, the independent party formed to protect Kidderminster Hospital, who had Dr Richard Taylor elected in two general elections, lost one of their two seats on the council to the Conservatives.
The Conservative Party's parliamentary candidate for Worcester, Robin Walker, said: "We've won a seat in Claines that we haven't held for 12 years and we've increased our vote in most areas of the city, so that's good to see."
UKIP has lost both of its county councillors in Redditch with Labour also losing two there.
Labour leader of Redditch Borough Council Bill Hartnett said: "(It's been a) really, really tight call. Big county divisions, there's only four divisions in Redditch and we lost marginally on two seats."
