More than 70 applications were received from university and college students for the competition, which is being run by V&A Dundee.
The baby boxes, which go into production in the summer, contain items including bedding and clothing.
The winner of the competition will be announced early next year.
The Scottish government's baby box scheme, which will cost an estimated £6m per year, is inspired by a Finnish project that has been running since 1938.
Students from North East Scotland College, Glasgow School of Art, Edinburgh College of Art, Edinburgh College and Edinburgh Napier University have been shortlisted in the competition.
The finalists will receive feedback from the judging panel before developing their final submissions.
Childcare and Early Years Minister Mark McDonald said: "We want Scotland's baby boxes to become a key and enduring part of the lives of parents and children, so the design needs to be bold and inspirational.
"The designs we have seen so far definitely achieve this and I congratulate and thank all the entrants for taking part."
The competition brief asked entrants to include an interactive element on the baby box where key stages in the child's first year can be recorded.
The winning student will receive a £1,000 prize and mentoring from Scottish designers Holly Fulton and Scott Jarvie.
The shortlisted designers are:
•         Grace Brown, North East Scotland College
•         Marwa Ebrahim, Glasgow School of Art
•         Ruth Hamilton, Edinburgh College of Art
•         Lena Sakura, Edinburgh College
•         Monika Stachowiak, North East Scotland College
•         Leanne Young, Edinburgh Napier University
