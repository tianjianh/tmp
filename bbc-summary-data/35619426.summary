After a goalless first half Cameron McGeehan headed the Hatters in front, but Bradley Fewster levelled as he rounded Luton goalkeeper Mark Tyler.
Jack Marriott restored Luton's lead when he backheeled Stephen O'Donnell's pass into the net, but once again York responded through Fewster.
But Lee settled matters with a 20-yard strike after a fine solo run in the final moments of the match.
York are now two points from safety at the bottom of League Two, while Luton consolidated 13th place.
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:
"Three individual mistakes have cost us three points. That's the disappointing thing because it's all preventable.

"To lose a goal like that to lose a game is very frustrating.
"It's points wasted where we should be getting out of trouble and we only have ourselves to blame.
"We've got nothing to show for all our hard work."
Luton Town manager Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"We have slight mixed emotions. We could have made it at lot easier for ourselves. We'll be pleased with the three goals we scored because they were two things we've worked on, and a bit of individual quality.
"We have to be better, we have to be better defensively to cut out those mistakes, to cut errors, to be a bit more secure with what we do so that when we do take leads we come through periods where the opposition has spells.
"It's about getting a balance to our squad. We've got a lot of good footballers, but we need more. We need different to what we have."
