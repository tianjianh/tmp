[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 2-2 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morton and Falkirk could not be separated as they played out their third Championship draw this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Thomas O'Ware headed in his 10th goal of the campaign to put Ton ahead but James Craigen equalised with a superb strike from distance.
After the break Aaron Muirhead's penalty gave the Bairns an advantage but Ross Forbes slotted his 11th of the season under Danny Rogers.
Both sides also had a goal ruled out in an action-packed contest.
The one Morton had chalked off was converted by Lawrence Shankland from close range but referee Greg Aitken spotted a handball in the build-up.
Nathan Austin's tap-in was disallowed for the same reason in a result that follows two 1-1 draws between the teams in the league this season.
Falkirk remain ahead of Morton on goal difference in the play-off spots, but the Greenock side have a game in hand.
The value of O'Ware and Forbes to their cause was evident here. The latter supplied the cross for O'Ware to head in at the far post, taking the centre-back's impressive goal tally to 10.
Forbes' goal to bring them level at 2-2 was all about composure after a neat through ball by substitute Luke Donnelly.
Goal of the game award went to Craigen though - his 22-yard rocket into the top corner, via the underside of the crossbar, was an important equaliser when the Bairns were trailing.
Muirhead's penalty to put Falkirk 2-1 up arrived when Mark Russell felled Lee Miller, a foul the hosts did not dispute.
Morton manager Jim Duffy:  "You want to be a bit greedy and go for the three points but I thought it was an outstanding game.
"Four goals, a couple of magnificent saves from either goalkeeper, misses and contentious decisions from the referee - I think that's what Scottish football's about.
"It's incredible for Thomas O'Ware and Ross Forbes - a defender and a midfielder - to be so instrumental in our season with goals.
"The disallowed goal was a ricochet that landed to Shankland who put it in the back of the net and the referee said it was a handball leading up it, but I believe it was very harsh."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "A draw was probably a fair result. I could turn to the two chances we had when we were 2-1 up and the goal that we had disallowed.
"I've seen the video again and I don't know - I think the far-side assistant said it was because of a handball, but the video shows that ball didn't go near his hand.
"James Craigen has got that kind of goal in his locker. He connected with it sweetly and it got us a goal in a first half that we hadn't been at it.
"We're 10 points ahead of Queen of the South [in fifth place] and I'd much rather be 10 points ahead than having to chase."
