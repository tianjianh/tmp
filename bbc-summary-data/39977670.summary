Having previously worked at Barnsley, Mansford has overseen a busy year in which the club secured fresh investment from new co-owner Andrea Radrizzani.
Leeds have said news will follow about a replacement "in the coming days".
"Ben has been a major factor in the club's resurgence in the past 12 months commercially and in the community," Radrizzani told the club website.
Fellow co-owner Massimo Cellino added: "Working with Ben has been a positive and enjoyable experience and I would like to personally wish him all the best going forwards."
Leeds finished seventh in the Championship this term, five points off the play-offs.
