VE Day anniversary: Church bells to ring across UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Churches and cathedrals across the UK will ring their bells later to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day - the end of World War Two in Europe.

Bells will ring out at 11:00 BST as part of a second day of commemorations, and a 1940s-themed concert will be held later at London's Horse Guards Parade.
On Friday, wreaths were laid at the Cenotaph and the Queen led a ceremony to light beacons across the UK.
Other European and Commonwealth countries have also held VE Day events.
Russia, which lost more citizens to the war than any other nation, is due to hold a Victory parade in Moscow's Red Square. The UK, US and Germany have declined to send a representative in protest at Russia's actions in Ukraine.
In Britain, bells will ring out in victory - signifying the end to years of conflict that saw church bells hanging silent.
The Horse Guards Parade concert will later feature musical acts including Pixie Lott and Status Quo, who will perform wartime songs, and actors John Simm, Julia Sawalha and Laurence Fox, who will give readings.
The Royal British Legion, which has worked with the government to prepare the commemorations, will also host a reception for 2,000 veterans.
Hundreds of smaller community events have been planned across the country after schools and local authorities were encouraged to take part. Sporting events have been encouraged to organise two minutes of applause.
Elsewhere, Jersey will celebrate the liberation of the Channel Islands - the only part of the British Isles occupied by the Germans during WW2.
On Friday the Queen, with the Duke of Edinburgh, greeted crowds gathered to watch the ceremony at Windsor Great Park - where she lit the first of hundreds of beacons on display across the UK.
It commemorated an event on 8 May 1945, when people across the country lit hundreds of bonfires and beacons to celebrate the end of the war.
More than 100 veterans and dignitaries attended a ceremony at the Cenotaph, in London's Whitehall on Friday.
They included PM David Cameron, who was joined by Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg, in their last major roles as leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats following their post-election resignations.
All three laid wreaths, along with SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, while defence secretary Philip Hammond and newly-elected MP and Mayor of London Boris Johnson also attended.
At 15:00 BST - the moment Prime Minister Winston Churchill broadcast the news of the German surrender to the nation - a two-minute silence was held.
Churchill's great grandson Randolph Churchill also read an extract from the speech the war-time prime minister gave 70 years ago.
On Sunday, the Queen is due to attend a service of thanksgiving at London's Westminster Abbey.
Around 1,000 veterans and their families will join politicians, members of the armed forces and representatives of the Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain for the service.
A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the abbey along Whitehall - past the balcony where Churchill made a historic speech before vast crowds - before a reception in St James's Park.
There will also be a fly-past over central London by the Red Arrows, following a fly-by of World War Two aircraft, including the Lancaster bomber and Spitfire and Hurricane fighters.
