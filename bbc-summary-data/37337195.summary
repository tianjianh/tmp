Club MTV Londonderry concert: Dozens in hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of young people attending an MTV concert in Londonderry have been treated in hospital for assault or drug and alcohol-related conditions.

Thirty people, some as young as 12, were brought to Altnagelvin A&E during and after Saturday's Club MTV event at Ebrington Square.
Some of those admitted needed intensive care treatment, Emergency Medical Consultant Paul Baylis told the BBC.
Resources at the department had been "stretched to their limits", he added.
"There was a significant increase in attendances from early evening on Saturday through to the early hours of Sunday morning as a result of the concert," Dr Baylis told BBC Radio Foyle.
"There was a large number of young people, ranging in age from around 12 or 13 to 25, who presented at the department, most of them intoxicated with alcohol and or recreational drugs."
He said there was also an increase in the number of cases of assault and that injured patients said they had been assaulted by people who were drunk or high on drugs.
"I know it's a night of fun for them, but when you're stitching up their faces, you're thinking this scar is a souvenir they'll have for the rest of their lives," said Dr Baylis.
He added that many of the additional patients were "extremely distressed" and required significant nursing support.
"Our usual challenging Saturday evening became a more dangerous environment for all our patients as our fixed staffing resources strived to cope with the additional workload," he said.
Warning parents to give "careful consideration" before allowing teenagers to attend such events in future, Dr Baylis said: "The drugs that are being peddled at these concerts are not regulated in any way and there is no way of knowing the dangers of consuming them, especially when washed down with alcohol.
"It can lead to extreme vulnerability to all forms of assault as they lose their ability to object to whatever might happen to them."
Laura, 28, from Derry, attended the event with friends and said there were "lots and lots of drunk kids, mainly under 16".
The mother-of-two said some of them should not have been let in and she was not searched, despite having a handbag.
"I thought it was going to be segregated with an area for under-18s and another for over-18s," she said. "When you go to a concert, even at my age, you don't want to be hanging around with 12 year olds."
"You do have to wonder where the parents were when these children were drunk at four o'clock in the afternoon," she added.
Stephen Kelly, who was one of the stewards at the event, said buses arrived from Sligo, Slane, Tyrone and Belfast, and were "spilling out people who were incapable of being on a bus never mind a music event".
He told BBC Radio Ulster those who came by bus were "strangers to the city" and the choice was to either let them "wander the streets" or bring them into a "safe environment".
The security staff had heard reports of drunken teenagers in the city centre well before the gates opened, he added.
He said he was disappointed for the organisers, who were "trying to do something good", and for the young people themselves, the "vast majority of which had a brilliant evening".
Robert Allen, from organiser Legacy Promotions, said the firm would probably never host another under-18 event again.
He denied reports the event was chaotic, saying they "weren't overwhelmed", and less than 1% of the 12,000 concert-goers needed treatment.
"The whole thing has been blown out of proportion," he told BBC Radio Ulster.
"I have a 10 year old and when she gets to 14 and wants to go to an event, I would be with her.
"I would not be leaving her down in the city and not knowing what she is going to be doing for four hours before the gates open. You have to take responsibility for your children."
He said up to 20 buses arrived at the event and between 50 and 100 people were turned away at the gate because they had been drinking to excess.
"When the people came off these buses, we had two options - either let them lie in the street or take them to a medical centre and get them treated. We treated everyone who needed treated," he added.
