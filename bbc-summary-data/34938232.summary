The detached six-bedroom home in the Terrace, Barnes, collapsed at about midday, when resident Stephen Beard was passing.
Local estate agents said it used to be owned by Aimee Duffy but had since changed hands.
Duffy is a Welsh singer-song writer who shot to fame in 2008 with the single Mercy and her debut record Rockferry won a Grammy award.
