Paul John to leave Cardiff Blues for Hong Kong

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff Blues have confirmed assistant coach Paul John is to leave them to take charge of the Hong Kong Sevens team while working for the country's sports institute.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Wales scrum-half will replace fellow Welshman Gareth Baber as Hong Kong sevens boss.
Ex-Blues assistant coach Baber has succeeded Fiji's Rio Olympics Sevens gold medal-winning boss Ben Ryan.
Ryan recently joined the Welsh Rugby Union as a consultant.
Ryan had worked in top-flight American basketball after leaving his role with Fiji.
John will also oversee Hong Kong's women's and junior sevens set-ups as he takes over from Baber, who is also a former member of Blues' coaching staff.
John said: "It is the perfect opportunity to get back in to coaching sevens and it's a sport I'm very passionate about and has huge potential."
