The 30-year-old Australian, who won the title with Ducati in 2007, will begin his new role next year.
Stoner left Ducati in 2011 to join Honda, winning a second title in his debut season, and testing for them since retiring in 2012.
"The opportunity to work with Ducati again is something very special," said Stoner in a Ducati statement.
"It's been a great journey with HRC over the last five years. Winning the World Championship in 2011 was obviously a high point and I've made many friends and formed lasting relationships along the way.
"The Ducati brand and the Ducati fans have been such a big part of my career and my life, so it will be really great to reunite the relationship and start another chapter with this iconic brand."
