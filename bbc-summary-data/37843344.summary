Borussia Monchengladbach 1-1 Celtic: Celtic player ratings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic came from behind to claim a point from their Champions League Group C clash with Borussia Monchengladbach in Germany.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moussa Dembele's penalty cancelled out Lars Stindl's opener and kept alive Celtic's hopes of progressing from Group C.
It is only the third time in 29 Champions League group games away from home that Celtic have avoided defeat.
Former Celtic goalkeeper Pat Bonner rates the performances of the Celtic players against the Bundesliga outfit.
Craig Gordon 7
Didn't do anything wrong, made a couple of saves and had no chance for the goal.
Cristian Gamboa 7
Played very well after the first 10 minutes when he was giving the ball away. Once he settled down, he was up and down the right wing and did quite well.
Mikael Lustig 7
Solid at the back. Any problems he had were more from midfielders giving the ball away in bad areas.
Erik Sviatchenko 7
Similar to Lustig, although maybe for the Stindl goal he could have closed down the ball a bit better, but he still gets a seven.
Emilio Izaguirre 8
Played very well defensively, stuck to his task and did everything asked of him. Stayed in position and didn't bomb forward.
Scott Brown 7
Was on his own in the middle of the park for a lot of the time. It was a difficult night for him up against Stindl but he led the team quite well.
Stuart Armstrong 7
He made some mistakes but he went looking for the ball. He ran 7.2km - more than any other Celtic player. It's not his natural position - almost a holding midfielder role - but he'll learn from the match.
James Forrest 6
Didn't affect the game enough from a positive point of view. He worked away but a little bit more is expected from him and it wasn't a surprise when he was taken off.
Tom Rogic 6
Like Forrest, he could've affected the game a little bit more positively. He's having a wonderful season but in Germany he didn't quite get himself into positions in which spectators are accustomed to seeing him in.
Scott Sinclair 7
He hit the post with a fantastic effort and had a couple of other chances despite being up against a very good full-back. He worked away tirelessly all night and always looked a threat.
Moussa Dembele 7
His composure and also his part in winning the penalty were terrific. To go up and stick away a penalty in the Champions League was not easy after missing one in Barcelona.
Patrick Roberts 7 (replaced Forrest)
He was involved in the big moments: he put the pass through for Dembele's goal and for Callum McGregor's late chance. To come on and make an impact is all you can ask of a substitute.
Callum McGregor 6 (replaced Rogic)
He had that big chance - he could have been the hero. He should have scored or picked the pass to Sinclair. Probably didn't have long enough to make a huge contribution but he'll be disappointed with the miss.
Liam Henderson 6 (replaced Gamboa)
Came on late in the game. Looked nice and lively and had one shot that he curled just wide.
