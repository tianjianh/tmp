"I was able to hug him and talk, it was brilliant."

That was the reaction of a dad whose son has been cleared of killing a British teenager while on holiday in Malia.
Myles Litchmore-Dunbar has spent 16 months in a Greek jail for a crime he says he didn't commit.
Tyrell Matthews-Burton was in Malia celebrating his 19th birthday when a fight broke out outside a bar involving about 30 British tourists.
Tyrell was stabbed and died.
Myles Litchmore-Dunbar was found guilty of affray but is appealing that charge and denies playing any part in the killing of the teenager.
His dad Chris told Newsbeat: "It was a very long 16 months. Very hard.
"Having to be in the UK, not able to see my son, going to work every day to make sure we had funds to pay for the legal fees. But whatever I felt, it's nothing compared to what he went through."
"Yesterday I saw him. I was able to hug him and talk and he was able to speak to family in England and his girlfriend. It was brilliant, really brilliant."
It is still unclear who killed Tyrell.
There are outstanding charges against at least one other person.
Tyrell's mother Sharon has previously said that her son's death was "senseless, brutal and unnecessary".
