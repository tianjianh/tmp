The Chinese-born, London-based artist has won the Catlin Art Prize, which rewards emerging talents who have been out of art school for a year.
Her winning installation includes torso-like objects connected by pipes.
The judges said she took viewers on a "compelling and unsettling journey".
Zhu Tian moved to the UK in 2002 and did a degree in economics before taking the MA Sculpture course at the Royal College of Art.
Her prize money will show up in another work, Money, in which she has promised to use her website to publish her bank balance on the first day of every month until she dies.
Paul Schneider, who studied at the Royal Academy of Arts, picked up £2,000 as winner of the Visitor Vote after a poll of people who have seen the exhibition of shortlisted artists.
Schneider's installation Breaking the Rules (above) presents a shrunken and compressed sports court.
The other nominees included the Jon Baker, who has created Mother's Medal (Kink) (above), large-scale photographic collages using colourful magnified images of organic material.
Felicity Hammond was nominated for Capital Growth (above) and You Will Enter An Oasis, which feature a vision of decaying opulence.
At 22, Oliver Hickmet was the youngest artist on the shortlist. His work Are We Nearly There Yet (above) also used photo collages to highlight how property developments are enhanced and marketed as lifestyle concepts.
Camouflaged faces peer out from Honolulu-born Nicholas William Johnson's foliage- and graffiti-covered hoardings, titled Plant of Many Faces (The Bush Said Nothing).
In a darkened room, Lexi Strauss uses paintings, projections and the sound of anecdotes and lullabies to bring her work, including Babyklappe, Germany (above), to life.
The cover images from Mills and Boon novels have been painted onto the backs of black leather jackets in Dominic Watson's Lowbrow Ecstasy. Watson, who went to the Glasgow School of Art, is the only nominee who did not study in London.
The exhibition is at the Londonewcastle Project Space in east London until 30 May.
