Leeds City Council confirmed the bout of illness among the group from Guiseley School.
In a statement, the school said 46 children and four staff had been checked by doctors and kept in hospital for observation.
The school said the illness was "not contagious or serious" but treatment had been instigated as "a precaution".
The group consists of year 11 pupils on a trip to battlefields in northern Europe.
In total, 80 students, eight members of staff and two bus drivers were on the trip.
Members of the group became ill as they were returning home last night and stayed overnight in Zeebrugge for hospital treatment.
Belgian news reports said they became ill with food poisoning as their buses entered the ferry port. They were taken to seven hospitals in the area after an emergency plan was triggered.
The Red Cross was involved in the operation and those not affected were taken to a hostel.
Twenty-three pupils and all four of the staff affected have now been discharged and are thought to be going home later, along with those unaffected.
More of the remaining pupils are expected to be released in the coming hours.
The landlady at Herdersbrug Youth Hostel in Bruges, where the unaffected children were taken, told BBC Look North that four children would remain in hospital for observation tonight, with one teacher to supervise them.
One student apparently on the the trip said on Twitter: "Such a scary night in Belgium".". Another posted: "THIS IS HELL #stranded."
Kiara de Angelis wrote on BBC Look North's Facebook page: "My sister is one of those kids. She was also ill but the situation is being handled really well."
Paul Clayton, acting co-headteacher, said: "Both children and staff have been checked by doctors and, while their conditions are not thought to be serious or contagious, as a precaution they were kept in hospital and monitored overnight."
He said the school would continue to work with the authorities to keep "a close eye" on the children in the coming days.
One parent waiting back in Leeds said he thought the school "had been really good in terms of communication" and was pleased more staff had been sent to Belgium.
But another parent described the communication from the school as "appalling".
