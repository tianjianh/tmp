Stephanie Embley, 35, of Pine Road, Cantley, South Yorkshire, was investigated after the parents of one of the boys raised concerns about her.
She admitted four charges of sexual activity with a child and was found guilty of a further two at Sheffield Crown Court on Friday.
She was jailed and given a 10-year Sexual Harm Prevention Order.
That means she can have no contact, either directly or indirectly, with children under the age of 16, police said.
Speaking after the sentencing, Det Con Brian Thompson said: "Embley preyed on and took advantage of teenage boys for her own sexual gratification, which is a despicable crime.
"I am pleased that she has been found guilty of, and pleaded guilty to, these horrific offences and that she is behind bars where she poses no further risk to children.
"The victims and their families have been supportive of our investigation and I thank them for their patience and bravery throughout this inquiry."
