It's after our big food survey showed more than half of kids don't eat any vegetables on a daily basis and one out of three have junk food more than three times a week.
We asked if you've ever wondered what the best and worst things to eat are, or have any questions about the effect different foods can have on your body.
You sent in loads of questions and we put as many as we could to our food expert Dr Radha.
