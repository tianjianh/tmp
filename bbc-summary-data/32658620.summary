England coach Peter Moores has been sacked after former captain Andrew Strauss was appointed as the new national director of cricket.

Moores was relieved of his duties following a dismal World Cup and the drawn Test series with West Indies.
The 52-year-old, who also coached England from 2007-2009, said: "I will walk away knowing I've given my all."
Strauss, 38, captained England in 50 of his 100 Test matches, before retiring in August 2012.
The former Middlesex batsman's role will see him oversee the selection process for the England team, as well as performance and development. The new head coach will also report directly to him.
Assistant coach Paul Farbrace will take charge of the side for the two-Test series against New Zealand, which starts at Lord's on 21 May.
"I knew when I took on the role that this was going to be a tough period for English cricket and I would need time and support to get new players through," said Moores.
"My frustration is not being given that time."
Reports claiming Moores was to be dismissed emerged on Friday, while England were playing Ireland in a washed-out one-day international in Dublin.
Confirmation of his sacking followed soon after the announcement of Strauss' appointment on Saturday.
Moores, reappointed England coach in April 2014, was in charge for the World Cup campaign, which saw them eliminated by Bangladesh.
He also oversaw the drawn series with a West Indies side labelled "mediocre" by incoming England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves.
The appointment of Strauss follows the sacking of Paul Downton as ECB managing director.
His fellow former England captains Alec Stewart and Michael Vaughan also expressed initial interest in the post.
ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said Strauss was "an exceptional England captain, is an authoritative voice on the modern game and has a wealth of experience building successful teams".
Moores' agent Luke Sutton said on Twitter: "I do wish Straussy all the best. He's a good cricket man and a strong leader. Tough job on his hands, good luck to him."
On Friday, Sutton had posted a series of tweets in defence of Moores and expressing anger at his treatment. "Peter is a good man who doesn't deserve this," he wrote, but later deleted the posts.
After the New Zealand series, England play Australia in July and August.
