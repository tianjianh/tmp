Ogmore by-election: some possible runners and riders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They might need a pencil sharpener or two in Ogmore. Voters there are likely to be busy on May 5, choosing a police and crime commissioner, a constituency AM, regional AMs and a new MP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The latter vacancy will be caused by the decision of Huw Irranca-Davies to leave Westminster in search of a seat in the National Assembly for Wales. The parliamentary by-election is likely to be held on the same day.
The process of choosing his replacement as Labour candidate - defending that 13,043 majority - begins imminently and is due to conclude in mid-February. So who are likely to be the runners and riders?
My man in Maesteg Market tells me several names are being mentioned.
Barrister Paul Fisher who stood in a council by-election in Pentyrch recently has publicly declared his interest in the seat.
Alex Owen, a county councillor from Pencoed (Penprysg ward) and Ross Thomas (another Maesteg West ward councillor) are also tipped to throw their hat in the ring.
I was intrigued to hear the names of political veterans mentioned. Christine Gwyther was agriculture minister in the early days of devolution. Chris Ruane lost his seat at last year's general election although it is a long way from the Vale of Clwyd to the Llynfi, Garw and Ogmore valleys.
Tony Graham is Wales manager of the Trussell Trust, which enjoys a high profile for its role running food banks.
Jayne Brencher is a teacher and councillor. Ceri Reeves is another Maesteg West councillor - and prominent party activist.
Chris Elmore fought Vale of Glamorgan in last year's general election and is widely seen as a well-connected favourite.
My list isn't exhaustive - on paper it's a very safe seat and will attract many applicants. It is fair to say there has also been a marked (but understandable) reluctance on the part of some of the names above to confirm their intentions.
Mr Irranca-Davies resigned on Monday as chair of the environmental audit committee and is expected to resign as an MP in March to pave the way for the by-election.
Speaker John Bercow said: "I know the House will wish to join me in expressing its collective appreciation of the commitment to, and passion for, the remit of that committee that the hon. gentleman has exhibited since he took up the chair shortly after the general election."
Mr Irranca-Davies is well-liked across parties at Westminster, although his decision to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for the Labour leadership (to ensure he got on the ballot paper) did not go down well with some of his own party colleagues.
Although Guido Fawkes has reported local fears of a stitch-up, I'm told the short-listing will definitely take place in Wales rather than London. It would be a surprise if the winner, who should be announced on February 13, did not have strong local or Welsh connections.
