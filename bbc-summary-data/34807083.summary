Fire crews were called to a horse box on fire at a farm in Horris Hill, Newtown Common, early on Wednesday.
It emerged that burglars had broken into a tack store on the farm and taken nine saddles, worth Â£12,000, and some bridles.
Police said, during the raid, the suspects set fire to a horse box truck and flames spread to a nearby stable.
Although the occupants managed to rescue the horses inside the stable two were injured by the fire, with one suffering serious burns to its back.
Stable owner Martin Pope said: "They've caused an enormous amount of damage, threatened all the horses' lives and any humans who were trying to save the horses."
Det Con Alex Hall, of Hampshire Constabulary, said: "This type of offence is extremely rare.
"Although it is not clear why the horse truck was set on fire, it does not appear it was the offenders' intention to cause injury to the horses.
"Nevertheless I would urge horse owners to be vigilant and to report any suspicious activity in their local area."
Police said the incident was thought to have taken place between 02:30 and 03:30 GMT.
Anyone with information is urged to contact police.
