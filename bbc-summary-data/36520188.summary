England v Wales: Chris Coleman urges fans to avoid 'aggression' at Euro 2016 game

Wales manager Chris Coleman has urged fans not to get involved in anything "untoward" around their Euro 2016 game against England in Lens on Thursday.

Wales beat Slovakia 2-1 in their first Group B game and authorities praised the behaviour of travelling Welsh fans.
But in Saturday's other Group B game, the end of England's draw against Russia was marred by violence.
Coleman blamed a "mindless minority" for the incidents that have affected the tournament so far.
"The aggression starts on the pitch and it should remain on the pitch. Off the pitch there should not be any aggression," Coleman said.
Uefa has threatened to disqualify England and Russia from the tournament if there is any further violence by their fans. French prosecutors said 150 Russians were behind the most serious clashes before the 1-1 draw in Marseille.

England manager Roy Hodgson and captain Wayne Rooney have appealed directly to fans to "stay out of trouble".
Coleman understands there will be a lot of interest in the game from Wales' travelling supporters and has not advised them to stay away from Lens.
"It's difficult to say to the Welsh public don't come and sample the atmosphere," he added. "It's the Euros - they have been waiting for a major tournament for goodness knows how long.
"They deserve to enjoy this experience as much as anybody else."
About 24,000 Welsh fans had tickets to watch Wales beat Slovakia in their opening match and first major tournament in 58 years.
Welsh police officers, who are part of the police operation in France, praised the "great behaviour from thousands of fans around Bordeaux city centre" following Saturday's victory.
However, the Football Association of Wales fears there is the potential for trouble in Lens and nearby Lille  - especially with Russia meeting Slovakia in Lille the previous day.
It has warned fans without tickets not to travel there for Thursday's game.
