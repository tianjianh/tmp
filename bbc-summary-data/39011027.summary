Argyle reported the midfielder, 27, to the FA after the incident in the 86th minute of the game.
It was not seen by the match officials at the time, but was caught on video.
Kelly denied the violent conduct charge but the FA found him guilty and ruled that the standard three-match ban was "clearly insufficient".
