[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arlene, 15,  was last seen being driven away by Howard in the early hours of the morning after attending a disco in Bundoran, County Donegal in 1994.
Patricia Quinn denied she was in a relationship with Howard and said they were just friends.
However, under questioning, she said he slept in her bed when he stayed over.
She told Belfast Coroners Court: "He wasn't interested in me. He was interested in young girls in uniforms."
Ms Quinn's daughter, Donna, had been friends with Arlene since they were young children.
On the night in 1994 that the teenager disappeared she had been to a disco in Bundoran with Donna Quinn, her boyfriend and Robert Howard.
Arlene's body has never been found.
Howard has always been the prime suspect in the case despite being acquitted in 2005.
At the time the jury were not told he was already serving a life sentence for the murder of Kent teenager Hannah Williams.
The 71-year-old died in prison last year.
