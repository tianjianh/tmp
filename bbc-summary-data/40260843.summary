Ruan Pienaar completes move from Ulster to Montpellier

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South African scrum-half Ruan Pienaar has joined French Top 14 side Montpellier on a three-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pienaar spent seven seasons with Ulster and had been keen to extend his stay with the Belfast club.
But the Irish RFU told Ulster they could not retain the 33-year-old, claiming he was blocking the development of Irish-qualified players.
Pienaar has said he would like to return to Ulster in a coaching capacity at some stage.
On Tuesday Montpellier announced Pienaar had agreed a deal taking him up to 2020.
They have also captured French number eight Louis Picamoles from Northampton and New Zealand fly-half Aaron Cruden.
