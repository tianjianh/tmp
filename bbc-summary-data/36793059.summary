Edmund, 21, is leading the British team as Andy Murray sits out the tie on clay following his Wimbledon victory.
Although Murray is not playing, the British number one has flown out to support his team-mates.
"If any of the players want to ask me anything, I'll help or try and give some advice," Murray told BBC Sport.
"I'm not here to start telling anyone what to do. We've got a great team - this team has won the Davis Cup before.
"The guys that are here helping, they do a great job and I've had that advice from them over the last few years."
In Friday's second match, British number five James Ward takes on Dusan Lajovic, the world number 81.

Saturday's doubles match will see Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot take on world number 405 Tipsarevic and Nenad Zimonjic.
World number 67 Edmund made his debut in last year's final against Belgium as Britain won the Davis Cup for the first time since 1936.
Ward, ranked 240 in the world, earned a crucial win against American John Isner in the first round of last year's competition.
Serbia's world number one Novak Djokovic pulled out of the tie following his surprise defeat by American Sam Querrey in Wimbledon's third round.

Kyle Edmund has clocked up some useful tour wins since making his debut in last year's final and can be expected to be a major part of the GB team for another decade. Captain Leon Smith says he can "absolutely" see him as a top-10 player of the future.
James Ward, with his grass court shoes in his suitcase, was planning to fly to Rhode Island last Wednesday, before a call from his captain that morning altered his plans. He has not won a tour level match since last year's Wimbledon, but the hope is that his Davis Cup experience will come to the fore.
Friday's first rubber could be critical to the outcome of the tie. Edmund might be ranked 338 places above Janko Tipsarevic, but before a string of injuries the Serb was good enough to qualify for the 2012 World Tour Finals.
