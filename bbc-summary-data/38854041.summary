North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Arfon Jones said he feared counter-terrorism policing could be focused on ports in south-east England.
He warned it could leave ports such as Holyhead on Anglesey - the UK's second busiest passenger port - understaffed.
The commissioner added more security resources are needed, not less.
"I think we all know that criminals and terrorists are going to find the easiest way to get into the country, and they won't worry much if it's from Dublin or Heathrow," he said.
"If we cut down on the numbers of police officers in Holyhead, in Pembrokeshire, Lancashire and Scotland, it's going to make it easier for criminals and terrorists to come in."
Holyhead port carries 2.1 million passengers and 400,000 lorries between Anglesey and Dublin every year.
Mr Jones, who was elected to the post standing for Plaid Cymru last year, said he had quizzed the UK's security minister Ben Wallace recently, and was "told the Government were aware of vulnerabilities at the ports".
