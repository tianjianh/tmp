Pop musician Craig David returns to perform in his hometown as the opening headliner at the Southampton event, organisers said.
Scottish rockers Primal Scream have been revealed as the Sunday night headliners for the new Oxford festival next year.
Both artists will swap venues to play as each other's support acts.
Public Enemy, Gaz Coombes, Ghostpoet and Chas and Dave will also play at both venues over the weekend.
The festivals take place on 28 and 29 May on Southampton Common and in Oxford's South Park.
They are being organised by Rob da Bank, a DJ who started Bestival on the Isle of Wight and also runs Camp Bestival in Dorset.
