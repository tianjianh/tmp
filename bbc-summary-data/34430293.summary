Afghanistan have appointed former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq as temporary coach for their tour of Zimbabwe.

Inzamam talked with Afghanistan cricket officials on Friday and said he turned down a longer contract.
"I don't have experience of coaching an international team. That's why I wanted to first see how it goes," he added.
Afghanistan and Zimbabwe will play five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 internationals from 16-29 October.
Inzamam, 45, scored 8,830 runs in 120 Test matches and 11,739 runs in 378 ODIs before retiring from international cricket in 2007.
He becomes the third ex-Pakistan Test player to coach Afghanistan after Rashid Latif and Kabir Khan, and replaces Englishman Andy Moles, whose contract expired in August.
