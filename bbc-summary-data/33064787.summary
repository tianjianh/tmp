[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
RLC will be the first tenant of Global Point Business Park, Invest NI's largest industrial development site.
The company makes components for some of the best-known names in the aerospace sector, including Martin Baker and Rolls-Royce.
RLC, which is based in the Isle of Man, already employs more than 250 people at its facility in Crumlin, County Antrim.
The Crumlin facility will stay open.
RLC will also use it as the base for a research and development project focusing on engine components.
The company is investing Â£35m with Invest NI providing Â£6.5m in job creation and research and development grants.
The location of the factory, Global Point, was supposed to begin operating as a business park more than 10 years ago.
However, it was hit by the withdrawal of a private sector developer, planning issues and the economic downturn.
