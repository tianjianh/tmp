Wanderers, who are Â£172.9m in debt, recently appointed Trevor Birch as an advisor to the board in order to ease a takeover from owner Eddie Davies.
In a statement on their website, the club said the non-payment happened because of the need to find a new buyer.
"This is due to a short-term funding issue," said 57-year-old Birch.
"We are working hard behind the scenes and hope to have this resolved in a quick and timely manner and I will be meeting the players tomorrow (Tuesday) to update them."
Isle of Man-based businessman Davies is willing to forego the entire debt owed to his company Burden Leisure PLC in the hope of easing a takeover process.
Bolton are currently four points adrift at the foot of the Championship table, having won only one of their 17 league games so far this season.
They face Brentford at home on Monday evening.
