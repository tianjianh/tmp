In a case dubbed the "war on terrier", Depp's wife Amber Heard faces charges of breaching Australia's strict Quarantine Act for failing to declare the couple's dogs, Pistol and Boo.
Ms Heard had indicated the pair would avoid Australia because of Mr Joyce.
But Mr Depp now says he has been "invited to stay" at the newly-elected deputy prime minister's house.
"Of course, I love Australia," he told journalist Emma Dallimore on the Grammys red carpet on Sunday.
"Absolutely, [I will come back] ... I think that guy Barnaby? He invited me to stay at his house, for some reason."
The case sparked global attention after Depp's pet terriers were threatened with being put down by then agriculture minister Joyce.
Mr Joyce had said in an interview last year: "If we start letting movie stars, even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice, to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody? It's time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States."
Under strict Australian laws, dogs entering from the US must be declared and have to be quarantined.
