Party leaders also struck a culinary note, with visits including a butcher's shop, a bakery and a coffee shop.
SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, has highlighted her party's pledge to increase spending on the NHS by at least the rate of inflation if she remained first minister.
Visiting a cafe in Leith, where she tried her hand at icing cupcakes, Ms Sturgeon also pledged to build a network of new regional treatment centres to cope with the pressures of an ageing population.
Kezia Dugdale met Labour activists in Leith for an early morning coffee prior to a day's Holyrood election campaigning.
The Scottish Labour leader urged other parties to support anti-austerity policies, backing her plans to add a penny to income tax.
Ms Dugdale also insisted she had never supported the SNP amid claims she had applied for work experience with the rival party after university.
She said she had applied for a number of placements, but said she had never voted for or supported the SNP.
Ruth Davidson visited a butcher's shop recently re-opened after flooding in Ballater while campaigning in Aberdeenshire.
The Scottish Tory leader said her party supported a review of business rates, but said the taxes should be frozen in the meantime to relieve pressure on businesses.
Asked about air passenger duty, which the SNP want to cut, Ms Davidson said her priority was to help working families rather than cut the levy.
She also responded to speculation about David Cameron's tax affairs, saying the prime minster had made his position "perfectly clear".
Willie Rennie said new powers coming to Scotland were a "great opportunity" to do things differently.
The Scottish Lib Dem leader promoted his plans for a 1p rise in the basic rate of income tax, saying this would be "appealing" to people as it would provide extra money for education.
Mr Rennie focused on education during a visit to the Science Festival at Summerhall in Edinburgh.
He said: "At school I always loved science, and went on to study biology. I want every child to have the same chance to study subjects that tehy are passionate about, and that is what our digital plans will deliver."
Patrick Harvie launched the Greens campaign in the west of Scotland alongside England and Wales Green Party leader Natalie Bennett.
The pair met with activists in Paisley before visiting the Woodlands Community Garden in Glasgow
Ms Bennett said: "The Green party won more than a million votes at last year's general election, but because of the first past the post electoral system this translated into just one seat.
"This year's elections in Scotland use a form of proportional representation, giving voters the opportunity to realistically elect politicians who will commit to Holyrood using its significant powers to take radical action."
