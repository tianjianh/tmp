The singer-songwriter tweeted on Sunday that he had given his "whole wardrobe [to] a bunch of charity shops" in Suffolk.
Two shops in his home town Framlingham, Suffolk, and one in Ipswich were given several bags each on Wednesday.
Suffolk Family Carers, based in Claydon, near Ipswich, also received about 15 pieces of clothing and plans to sell them via eBay in May.
"It will give fans from around the world a chance to get them," said Anna Haley, from the charity.
She said the charity, which is fundraising with BBC Radio Suffolk for a new mobile carers centre, had been working with Sheeran's mother, Imogen, a jewellery designer.
"His mum has designed a bangle for us, so he's heard about the campaign from her," she said.
Sue Ryder is to sell its items in Framlingham on 18 April.
St Elizabeth Hospice, which also has a shop in the town, said it was still deciding on how its clothing would be sold.
East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), for whom Sheeran is an ambassador, said it planned to hold an online auction, but would be saving some of the items for a sale at its new charity shop, due to open in Framlingham in May.
