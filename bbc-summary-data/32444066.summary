[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby man who got daughter pregnant is jailed for life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father who repeatedly raped his daughter over a four-year period resulting in her having a baby has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, who cannot be named to protect the girl's identity, admitted attacking her from the age of 10.
After his sentencing at Derby Crown Court, his daughter ran to him, crying out that she still loved him.
Judge Stuart Rafferty QC said it was difficult to "describe his depravity" and ordered he serve at least 15 years.
The court heard that the father had "poisoned" his daughter against her mother, who did not live with them, as part of a grooming process.
Suspicions were first raised when it was discovered the youngster was pregnant.
The man, fearful that the authorities would find out, encouraged his daughter to continue kick boxing in the hope it would trigger a miscarriage but when that failed they fled.
Eventually a DNA test revealed what he had done.
Giving evidence at his sentencing, the girl shook as she told the court that her father had destroyed her childhood and teenage years.
But she added: "I know what he did was wrong but I grew up with my dad at my side.
"I just wanted him to get help, to make him better, but unfortunately this never happened and it came to this. It has come to me having a baby."
In sentencing him, Judge Rafferty said: "It is difficult to find words that can properly describe the extent of your depravity and damage it has caused - not to a stranger but to your daughter.
"To be a parent is a privilege. Children do not ask to be born, children are to expect the best from their parents in terms of care and parental love.
"You gave your daughter a warped version of that which suited you and not her."
He added: "You took your daughter's life. You did not take it once you did every time you had sexual intercourse with her against her will."
As the man was led away following sentencing his daughter tried to run across the court, crying and screaming "I love you dad".
