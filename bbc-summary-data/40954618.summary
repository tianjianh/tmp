[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gardaí (Irish police) were called to the scene at Balbutcher Drive, Ballymun, shortly after 16:00 local time on Wednesday.
The man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene. A gun was found nearby and has been removed for a ballistic investigation.
Another man and woman were treated for less serious injuries in hospital.
A silver Opel Zafria was found partially burnt out on Balbucher Drive, and Gardaí have recovered a second car in Santry - a grey Golf which they believe was also involved in the attack.
RTÉ reports that the dead woman is a mother of six, and that the shooting was related to gang criminality but not connected to the Hutch Kinahan feud.
The area remains sealed off while Gardaí continue their investigation.
