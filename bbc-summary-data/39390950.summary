[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricky Miller netted a brace as Dover saw off National League play-off rivals Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Whites began the day one point and one place behind the visitors, but ended it within two points of fifth-placed Aldershot with a game in hand.
Miller lit up a scrappy first half when he curled a superb free-kick into the top corner after he had been fouled just outside the area.
Gateshead arrived on the south coast on the back of a 10-game unbeaten run, but they slipped down to eighth as Miller sealed Dover's win with his 36th goal of the season.
