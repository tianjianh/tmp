Manchester United's stuttering start to life under manager Louis van Gaal continued with a Premier League draw at Sunderland.

Things looked rosy for the Reds when Juan Mata pounced on Antonio Valencia's deflected cross to give them an early lead from close range.
But poor marking allowed Jack Rodwell - making his home debut - to head in Seb Larsson's corner after half an hour.
To add to United's troubles, Ashley Young was booked for diving.
The winger, criticised for going down too easily by former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, fell in the area following a challenge from ex-United defender Wes Brown, and referee Martin Atkinson had no hesitation in reaching for his pocket.
Before the match, Van Gaal said United would need a "miracle" to win the Premier League, and there was further evidence on Sunday to add weight to his gloomy prediction following last weekend's 2-1 home defeat by Swansea City.

The Dutchman, who took over in the summer, persisted with a 3-4-1-2 formation and, while his side look bright going forward, they remained fragile at the back.
Angel Di Maria, the Real Madrid winger, is expected to arrive before the transfer window closes on 1 September for a British record fee, but Van Gaal may seek further reinforcements.
Mata's 17th-minute strike failed to settle the visitors and their nervy backline was given a warning when Connor Wickham turned on a throw in yards of space and shot wide.
United were exposed moments later when Rodwell, whose opportunities were limited at Manchester City before his summer move to the Stadium of Light, beat Valencia at the near post to power a header past David De Gea.

United, without ineligible new signing Marcos Rojo, lost defender Chris Smalling to a hamstring injury to add to an injury list that now features eight first-team players, including midfielder Ander Herrera.
In a second half high on energy but low on quality, Wickham volleyed at youngster Tyler Blackett, who saw the ball rebound past De Gea's near post.
Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone had to be quick off his line to deny Young as both sides pressed for a winner in a tense finale.
The Black Cats have not beaten United in a Premier League match at home since 1997, but there were several positives for manager Gus Poyet after a vibrant performance.
Winger Will Buckley, signed from Brighton in the summer, was a constant menace, while Rodwell's goal was a welcome reward for 63 minutes' action following his unsuccessful spell at Etihad Stadium.
Sunderland manager Gus Poyet: "It was a good game to watch. We played a very good first half, going forward taking chances and creating half opportunities after conceding at what was the wrong time really because we were in control of the game. It was a big effort.
"We made a few decisions on how to play against a different system and the boys have done exceptionally well. We showed that we were organised and difficult to play against.
"The goal from Jack Rodwell was perfect for a home debut. There are plenty of positives. It's important we started better than last year and that was key. Will Buckley played well and was incisive as well."
On Fabio Borini, the Liverpool target, who has been offered a Sunderland contract: "We're getting close to a final decision either way because it's been a bit too long.
"It's time now that it's a 'yes' coming or a 'no' as we need to move on."
