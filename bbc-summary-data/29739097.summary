Donovan Kitching, from St John's in the Isle of Man, pleaded guilty in September to causing the death of Gwen Valentine from Winchester, Hampshire.
She was visiting family when she was struck by a car driven by Mr Kitching on the Tholt-y-Will Road on 26 April.
Deemster Alastair Montgomerie passed the sentence at Douglas courthouse.
Speaking to Ms Valentine's family, Mr Montgomerie said: "No sentence can cure your anguish, no sympathy that I can express can alleviate your suffering.
"All I can hope is that to some degree the finalisation of these court proceedings can assist you in moving on with your lives."
Kitching received eight years for causing death by dangerous driving and two years and 72 days for breaching his licence. The sentences will run consecutively.
The court heard he was under licence, having been released from jail three weeks earlier after serving a sentence for burglary.
Mr Montgomerie said the sentence reflected aggravating circumstances including the fact Kitching had never had a driving lesson, had never held a driving licence, had no insurance and had just failed a road-side breath test.
After he was stopped for drink-driving, Kitching assaulted the police officer and drove away.
He lost control of the car moments before knocking over Ms Valentine.
The court also heard that he had been in possession of Class A drugs and had fled the scene of the crash to avoid arrest.
Ms Valentine, 62, was preparing for her wedding in June having retired a week earlier.
The mother of three's fiance and son were both with her when she died.
