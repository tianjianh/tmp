Team GB won 47 medals at the Beijing Games four years ago and UK Sport wants 48 medals from at least 12 sports from the home London event.
UK Sport has invested Â£300m in Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes in the past four years.
"I have no doubt that our athletes will do us proud," said Baroness Sue Campbell CBE, chair of UK Sport.
"I am confident that we have created a sustainable high performance system set to ensure that London 2012 marks the beginning, not the end, of our ambitions for British Olympic and Paralympic sport," she added.
The Paralympic performance targets will be outlined in August.
