Call for 'sympathetic' green-coloured Gower caravans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New static caravans on the Gower Peninsula should be painted brown or green, a Gower heritage protection group has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gower Society wants new caravans to be "more sympathetic" to the surroundings by blending in.
It was the UK's first area of outstanding natural beauty in 1956 and has dozens of caravan sites.
"We're not saying existing caravans should be painted," chairman Robin Kirby said.
"We're not saying they should be replaced either but when the caravans are upgraded, new caravans should be painted in darker colours so they blend into the countryside."
"The society has been concerned for some time with the colour of static caravans which are light in colour. We believe they should be darker."
Mr Kirby told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme some static caravans are "the wrong colour."
"They should be juniper green or rustic brown," he said.
"The surroundings are obviously green and brown and at the moment, they don't blend into the countryside as well as they should.
"There are not local rules but we are concerned that there should be.
"We are not opposed to caravan sites because caravans provide accommodation and enjoyment for many families to explore the Gower, which is beautiful.
"And in fairness, when some caravan parks introduce new caravans they are more brown.
"I feel their responsibility is when caravan parks do replace old ones, they consider the new ones are of a more acceptable colour."
