The visit, later in June, is part of the Let Girls Learn initiative.
It comes six years after she delivered an emotional address to pupils at Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School in Islington, north London.
Mrs Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, and daughters Malia and Sasha will accompany her on the trip.
Her 2009 encounter with the Islington schoolgirls is said to have been a significant inspiration to her taking on a more campaigning role.
She was reunited with them in 2011, when she gave a speech at Oxford University on the second day of President Barack Obama's state visit to the UK.
The US embassy said Mrs Obama would "meet with students and discuss how the UK and the US are working together to expand access to girls' education around the world - supporting adolescent girls in completing their education".
Her trip to Europe will also take in Italy, where she is leading a presidential delegation on health issues and visiting members of the US military and their families stationed in Vicenza.
The aim of the Let Girls Learn initiative is to "encourage and support community-led solutions to reduce barriers that prevent adolescent girls from completing their education".
