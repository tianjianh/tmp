A litter of kittens had a lucky escape after being found in a car that was due to be crushed at a scrap yard in Lincolnshire.

The five cats were discovered in the boot of a Peugeot 106 by a mechanic at Johnson's Garage in Boston.
Owner Graham Johnson said the employee was "shocked" when he came across the animals while looking for a spare part.
He said a customer has already pledged to give a home to some of the abandoned kittens.
Mr Johnson said: "He was just looking for some parts for an old car and just happened to lift it up and there he found five little kittens.
"He was really shocked... it was just like seeing a spider, really makes you jump sometimes.
"We don't think they're very old at all, a few days, really.
"The mother is about somewhere, she's been flying here, there and everywhere."
