[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles are in the third round for the first time since being reformed in 1989 after a 1-0 win over Barnet.
Sheridan appreciates the financial impact a big team can bring, but is more concerned about qualifying for the fourth round.
"Obviously we want to go as far as we can and financially it can help the club - as simple as," he said.
"Listen, the draw takes care of itself.
"The lads are excited - everyone says we want this [team] or we want them, but at the end of the day it's another football match and whoever we get we've got to believe that we can get through to the next round.
"It gives the supporters a bit of excitement - you're in the hat and you don't know who you are going to get."
The draw for the third round will be made in Cardiff at 19:00 GMT on Monday and will be shown live on BBC Two.
