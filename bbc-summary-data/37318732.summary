Juventus, who start their Champions League campaign at home to Sevilla on Wednesday, have taken nine points from their first three league games, while defeat was Sassuolo's first of the season.
Massimiliano Allegri's Juventus are three points clear of Genoa and Sampdoria, both of whom play on Sunday.
