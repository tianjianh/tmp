The building, on land next to the main security entrance to the dock, would include state-of-the-art training and classroom suites, accommodation and social and fitness facilities.
There would also be waterfront access and docking facilities for warships.
The Royal Navy said it would "meet the aspirations of the UK's reserves forces for the next 50 years".
Vice Adm Jonathan Woodcock, the Second Sea Lord, said: "I am delighted to announce the development of a reserve hub in Cardiff Bay.
"The Royal Navy has a strong connection to south Wales and this investment reflects the Royal Navy's continued commitment to the area."
The new site would offer shared accommodation for three naval units - the RNR Unit HMS Cambria, The Royal Marine Reserves Cardiff Detachment and the Wales URNU.
Cdr Steve Fry, commanding officer of the local RNR unit HMS Cambria, said: "We are very excited about this project.
"This significant investment by the Royal Navy in Wales will provide great opportunities for our reservists and for anyone wishing to be part of the reserve forces."
A planning application will be submitted in the new year, with work on the building due to start next year and be completed by 2019.
The project would be delivered by the Reserve Forces' & Cadets' Association for Wales in partnership with the Royal Navy and Associated British Ports.
