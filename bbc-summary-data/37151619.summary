[SN]TITLE[SN]
Forest Green Rovers 5-1 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Forest Green racked up a fifth straight win with a convincing victory at home against struggling Southport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieffer Moore gave the hosts the perfect start by heading in Liam Noble's free-kick. After Mohamed Chemlal doubled the lead inside 10 minutes, Moore slammed a shot against the post as Andy Bishop's men were run ragged.
The player-manager offered a brief riposte himself, reducing Southport's arrears five minutes after the break by turning in a cross. And minutes later he forced Sam Russell into a good save with a low shot.
But Charlie Clough put matters beyond doubt when he headed in Noble's corner, and Moore and substitute Rhys Murphy added further gloss to the victory late on.
