Linfield win appeal over County Antrim Shield final venue

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The County Antrim Shield final is to be held at a neutral venue after Linfield challenged a decision to stage it at the ground of opponents Crusaders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The match had been set for 24 January at Seaview but now a new venue and date will be arranged by organisers.
Linfield lodged an appeal against the County Antrim FA's decision to play the final at Crusaders' Shore Road venue.
The match gives David Healy the chance of a first trophy since taking over as Linfield manager in October 2015.
Under Northern Ireland's record goalscorer, the Blues have lost in Irish Cup and Shield finals and also finished runners-up in the Irish Premiership last season.
The most likely date for this season's Shield decider is Tuesday, 7 February and the choice of venue appears to be between the Oval in Belfast or the Showgrounds at Ballymena.
Meanwhile, Glenavon have confirmed that they have signed defender/midfielder Aaron Canning from Championship club Loughgall until the end of the season.
