Investigators said the 23-year-olds are suspected of killing 11 people in the Iraqi city of Tikrit in June 2014.
They arrived in Finland in September, police said, and were arrested in the south-western town of Forssa.
Chief Inspector Jari Raty said that in the video the two suspects "were not masked".
"The victims were lying on the ground and they were shot one by one," he told Finnish broadcaster YLE.
Police said the accused men - who were not named - had been tracked down with the help of the Finnish Security Intelligence Service, but did not give details.
Mr Raty would not say whether or not the men had arrived in Finland to seek asylum.
The brothers are due to appear before a district court on Friday when police will ask for them to be formally placed under arrest, YLE reported.
Footage of the killings was made during the IS massacre of unarmed Iraqi Air Force cadets at the Camp Speicher military base near Tikrit.
The jihadists posted the propaganda videos online.
It is estimated that up to 1,700 people died in one of the worst atrocities committed in Iraq in recent times.
Mass graves were discovered after government forces recaptured the city in a major offensive earlier this year.
