Reid, who has not played since September 2014 when Stuart Pearce was manager, will be part of Paul Williams' backroom staff until the end of the season.
The 30-year-old said: "I've been asked to help out in any way I can.
"I would urge people to get behind the chairman, the manager and the team and see where that takes us."
Freedman was sacked on Sunday night following a run of five Championship defeats in six games that leaves the Reds nine points above the relegation zone.
The Scot was the seventh manager used by chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi in his 44 months at the club. Paul Williams, who has taken over until the end of the season, is the eighth.
Long-serving midfielder Chris Cohen added: "We haven't been good enough and we feel that we've let Dougie down. We've apologised to Fawaz for that.
"The way we've been playing and the run we've been on is down to the players."
