[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Glovers spurned early chances, with Marc Laird and Kevin Dawson failing to score before Zoko headed in against his former club in the second half.
The hosts looked to add a second but Harry Cornick and Dawson were denied by Magpies goalkeeper Scott Loach.
And Loach was also on hand to save Leroy Lita's late penalty, awarded for handball, as Yeovil held on.
