The 25-year old becomes the sixth player to be retained by the Devils, who were runners-up in last season's Elite Ice Hockey League.
The Devils have also retained Jake Morissette, Ben Bowns, Mark Richardson, Joey Martin and Josh Batch.
"Jones is a great skater. His skating ability is his best asset," said coach Andrew Lord.
