The world number four is five under at 2018 Ryder Cup venue Golf National along with Mikko Ilonen, Brandon Stone, Thongchai Jaidee and Jeunghun Wang.
Twice-champion Graeme McDowell missed the cut after a 73 left him on 11 over in Paris on Friday.
Darren Clarke struggled to an 80 while Michael Hoey had a 77 as they both ended on 12 over.
Paul Dunne (78) was 13 over to also also miss the weekend action but Padraig Harrington (70) is safely in on one over.
England's Andy Sullivan is two shots back in a share of ninth.
Masters winner Danny Willett missed his second consecutive after a 72 left him five over but Lee Westwood made the weekend by shooting 70 to sit two over.
McIlroy had talked about struggling with his swing after Thursday's round, but started in commanding form on Friday by making birdies on four holes on the front nine.
His excellence saw him move clear at the top until his only blemish on his card at 18 dropped him into the pack.
