Oscar Pistorius girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp: You scare me

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp sent him a text message saying: "I'm scared of you sometimes," his murder trial has heard.

The message was sent after the couple had a row when he accused her of flirting with another man - weeks before he shot her dead.
A police captain has been testifying about the couple's mobile phones.
Mr Pistorius denies deliberately killing his girlfriend of three months, saying he thought she was an intruder.
The trial has now entered is fourth week, with the prosecution expected to wrap up its case before Friday.
Capt Francois Moller said he had been able to extract some 35,000 pages' worth of messages from Ms Steenkamp's phone.
He told the court on Monday that 90% of the messages between the couple were loving, but he had picked out exceptions.
Mr Pistorius has said he has forgotten the password to his iPhone and investigators went to the US shortly before the trial began to meet Apple officials to try and gain access to it.
In one message sent on 27 January 2013, Ms Steenkamp wrote: "I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me and of how you react to me."
The couple had attended a friend's engagement dinner and left abruptly.
In another message written a week before her death, she said: "I can't be attacked by outsiders for dating you and be attacked by you - the one person I deserve protection from."

The texts show Reeva Steenkamp  loved Oscar Pistorius dearly, but she also paints a picture of a possessive and jealous boyfriend. An excerpt from one reads: "I was not flirting with anyone today, I feel sick that you suggested it."
Ms Steenkamp described their relationship as having double standards. While she would often hear of Mr Pistorius' "many relationships" he would get upset if she joked about a past lover, she said.
Mr Pistorius frequently threw tantrums, would snap at her when in a bad mood and was mistrusting of men around her, she wrote.
While most of the messages between the pair were said to be "loving", Ms Steenkamp's words revealed a union that was a far cry from the picture perfect relationship painted by Mr Pistorius in his affidavit.
The BBC's Andrew Harding in Pretoria says some of the messages read in court could be extremely damaging for Mr Pistorius, who has spoken of the couple being in a loving relationship.
Ms Steenkamp's messages paint a picture of the athlete as a jealous and possessive boyfriend prone to anger, our correspondent adds.
The texts between the couple also suggest Mr Pistorius asked Ms Steenkamp to keep quiet over an incident in January 2013 where he allegedly fired a gun at a restaurant - another charge he denies.
"Angel please don't say a thing to any one... I can't afford for that to come out," he wrote.
Earlier, one of Mr Pistorius' neighbours said she had heard both a man and woman scream on Valentine's Day 2013.
Anette Stipp, whose husband gave evidence earlier in the trial, said she heard the screams and gunshots at around 0300 local time on the day of the shooting.
She said she heard two groups of gunshots with a woman screaming in between.
Her testimony has closely matched that of other neighbours and witnesses, including her husband.
The defence has previously claimed that Mr Pistorius screams like a woman and that neighbours had confused his screams with those of Ms Steenkamp.
"It was a definitely a woman screaming," said Mrs Stipp.
She also said that the light was on in the bathroom cubicle, where Ms Steenkamp was when she was shot.
This contradicts evidence given by Mr Pistorius, who said that it was "pitch dark" where the shooting took place.
On Sunday the trial was extended and will now run until the middle of May. It had been due to end this week.
The prosecution says it will call upon four more witnesses before closing its case.
The defence team, led by Barry Roux, will then call upon its own witnesses, including Mr Pistorius himself.
Last week the trial heard evidence from ballistics experts and computer forensic teams who described the sequence and timing of the shots that killed Ms Steenkamp.
Mr Pistorius is a double amputee who holds six Paralympic medals and competed in the 2012 Olympic Games.
The prosecution accuses him of intentionally shooting Ms Steenkamp - a model, reality TV celebrity and law graduate - after an argument.
But the athlete maintains he believed his girlfriend was in bed and that an intruder had entered the bathroom when he shot at the toilet door in the early hours of 14 February 2013.
There are no juries at trials in South Africa, and his fate will ultimately be decided by the judge, assisted by two assessors.
If found guilty, the 27-year-old - dubbed the "blade runner" because of the prosthetic limbs he wore to race - could face life imprisonment.
