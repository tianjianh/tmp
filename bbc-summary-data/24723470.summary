One person who'd like to see this change is Ruben.
Ruben swims for Great Britain, loves to DJ for his mates and also has Down's Syndrome.
The genetic condition means he has learning difficulties and looks a bit different to some of his friends.
In his report he meets Seb, a boy who has modelled clothes for Marks and Spencer.
