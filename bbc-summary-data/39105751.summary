[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eibar 1-4 Real Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Karim Benzema scored twice as Real Madrid overcame the absence of injured Cristiano Ronaldo and suspended Gareth Bale to beat Eibar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker scored from a rebound after Yoel had saved his initial effort and then turned home James Rodriguez's free-kick to double Real's lead.
Benzema set up the third with a cross which Rodriguez slid home over Yoel.
Marco Asensio scored a fourth after Rodriguez's effort hit the post before a late Ruben Pena consolation.
Real briefly went top of the table, but Barcelona's 5-0 win over Celta Vigo later on Saturday restored their one-point lead.
