Ambulances were called to the attraction, which is Europe's longest zip wire, at around 8.30 BST on Wednesday.
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said the injuries were "not life-threatening".
All other Zip World facilities remain open.
Customers due to ride Velocity over the next 48 hours will be contacted by the ride's booking team to rearrange their visit.
A Zip World spokesman said: "Our technical team has advised that the Velocity adventure should be closed for two days so that further testing can take place.
"Safety at Zip World is ensured through a combination of technology, training and supervision.
"We invest in the best equipment and best training on a continual basis to ensure that our participants are kept safe."
The incident follows a "medical emergency" on Saturday, September 3 involving an elderly male at Zip World Titan in Blaenau Ffestiniog.
