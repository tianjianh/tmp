The pioneering road racer was in collision with a car while riding with friends in Thornhill Lees on Wednesday.
He is being kept in hospital and is being treated for a broken collar bone, six broken ribs and a punctured lung.
In 1955 he became the first Briton to finish the Tour de France and in 1958 was the first to win a stage.
His son-in-law, Martyn Bolt, who visited him in Pinderfields Hospital, said Mr Robinson was feeling "chipper" despite his injuries.
"He is sitting up, he's talking and he's now wanting to get out and be a bit more active," said Mr Bolt.
The accident happened on one of Mr Robinson's twice-weekly rides.
"He is coming down within about three or four miles of home what he thought was a clear open road and all of a sudden there was a crash with a car that he hadn't seen in front of him," said Mr Bolt.
Mr Robinson, who lives in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, is regarded as a trailblazer for the sport in Britain and his successes inspired the talents of Tom Simpson and Barry Hoban who followed him.
He was also an ambassador for bringing this year's Tour de France to Yorkshire earlier this month.
Personalities from the cycling world have taken to Twitter to wish Mr Robinson well. Gary Verity, the man behind Yorkshire's Tour de France bid, said: "Thoughts & prayers tonight for Brian Robinson please."
Mr Bolt said the accident had not put his father-in-law off cycling.
"He will want him to be back out and riding his bike," he said.
"Brian is never content unless he is pushing himself."
