International ballroom champion Shirley Ballas has been named as the new head judge on Strictly Come Dancing.
Nicknamed the Queen of Latin, the 56-year-old will replace Len Goodman when the BBC show returns this autumn.
Highly regarded in the world of ballroom, she has numerous titles to her name and is also the mother to Dancing with the Stars professional champion Mark Ballas.
Strictly professional Anton Du Beke and former judge Arlene Phillips were among the favourites to take on the head judge role.
Although not widely known to UK audiences, Ballas has been frequently seen on Dancing with the Stars, the US version of Strictly - on which Mark appeared for 10 years - giving masterclasses and commentary.
"I am so excited and over the moon to have been given this wonderful opportunity," she said.
"I can't wait to get in to the ballroom and be part of the incredible and respected judging panel. Strictly is so loved by the British public, I have always been a massive fan.  I just can't wait!"
