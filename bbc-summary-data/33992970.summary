[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A North Wales Police detective has been sacked by a disciplinary panel for using police computers to check-up on an ex-girlfriend and disobeying his superiors.

Det Sgt Gerallt Davies, 31, allegedly used computers 286 times to find what his ex-girlfriend, a police community support officer (PCSO), was doing.
Gross misconduct allegations were found proven at the hearing.
The panel chairman said it would be not possible to have trust in the officer.
The detective, who had been a CID officer at Caernarfon, Gwynedd, admitted six allegations of misconduct by accessing police systems.
But he denied two allegations of breaching a "lawful order" by visiting Menai Bridge Police Station - having allegedly tracked where the PCSO was on duty and by delivering a Valentine's Day card to her home.
In December he had been spoken to by two senior officers because his behaviour was said to have been upsetting the PCSO, the panel was told during the hearing at the force headquarters at Colwyn Bay, Conwy county.
