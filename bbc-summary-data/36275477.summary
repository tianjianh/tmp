'Increased workload' forces Conwy GPs to end contract

Another north Wales GP surgery is set to end its contract - the sixth since the end of last year.

Conwy's Llys Meddyg GP surgery will terminate its contract with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) in October, affecting around 3,700 patients.
The practice said both its GPs had been working 12-hour days to cope with an "increased workload".
After failing to recruit a new GP, both doctors had "no choice" but to resign.
The health board is opening a new 'GP hub' in former council offices in Prestatyn, with six extra doctors.
BCUHB has recently taken over Prestatyn's Pendyffryn Medical Group, a practice in Blaenau Ffestiniog in Gwynedd, and Wrexham's Beechley Medical Centre.
Dr Phil White, secretary of the north Wales local medical committee, said many local practices were now finding it difficult to compete with the locum rates paid by BCUHB-managed practices.
He added: "It is costing the taxpayer a fortune. We have failed to train enough GPs and there is an attitude among doctors that it is a second rate job.
"There is a lot of bureaucracy within GP practices. Our doctors are disappearing abroad because they are disillusioned with the NHS."
A BCUHB spokesman said patients do not need to register with a different GP practice, and normal services will continue until the end of October.
"We are writing to all patients registered at Llys Meddyg to let them know about this change and they should receive a letter early next week," he added.
"Over the next six months, we will keep practice staff and patients informed of our progress, and will respond to any concerns and questions."
