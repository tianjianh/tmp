Following the retirement of Bill Knox, member clubs and associations chose directors to the board, from which the chairman was then chosen.
Beatt said: "I am proud to have been elected Chair of one of Scotland's most established sports governing bodies.
"I aim to sustain the sport for the future whilst ensuring that current members and clubs are supported."
Beatt, who lives in Glasgow and is described as a "passionate bowler", has been a director of Bowls Scotland for the past two and a half years.
She is the owner and director of two businesses - People Solutions (Scotland) Ltd and The Whisky Ambassador Limited.
Knox added: "The election of Sue as chair of Bowls Scotland is fantastic.
"It shows that our clubs and members have chosen an individual with the relevant skill-set for the position.
"Sue will be a great asset to our board."
