Kat Parker, from Plymouth, was 26 when she was diagnosed with the disease and had to have her breasts and ovaries removed.
She has been clear of cancer for two years but her hair has never recovered.
Following a community fundraising effort, she has now had specialist extensions for people suffering severe hair loss and says she feels like a "different person".
