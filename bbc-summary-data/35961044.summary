Broccoli said she was "honoured" to accept the role.
"I am passionate about Bafta's role in educating, inspiring and celebrating generations of British film-makers," she added.
Broccoli and her half-brother, Michael G Wilson, have produced the last eight Bond films together, including Spectre.
She will join Greg Dyke - who was recently appointed the charity's vice president for television - in co-chairing Bafta's Council.
Broccoli's main role will be as an ambassador for the organisation.
Previous vice presidents for film include Lord Puttnam and Broccoli's predecessor, Duncan Kenworthy.
Dyke, who used to be the BBC's director general and was previously chairman of the British Film Institute (BFI), is currently chairman of the Football Association but is leaving the sports organisation in June.
Chair of Bafta, Anne Morrison, said: "I am delighted that Barbara Broccoli, one of the most illustrious and respected people in the contemporary film industry, will be joining Bafta as our vice president for film.
"With her connections on both sides of the Atlantic, Barbara is well placed to be a brilliant ambassador for Bafta and I know we'll benefit hugely from her experience and wisdom over the next few years."
She added: "With Greg Dyke announced recently as our television vice president, we are in good hands for the future."
Broccoli already has many philanthropic interests - she is a trustee of Into Film, a film education charity working with young people, and she is also patron of the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.
She also sits on the board of governors for Bafta Los Angeles.
The producer is also an honorary fellow of the National Film and Television School and an honorary member of Women in Film and Television UK.
HRH Prince William, The Duke of Cambridge, has been president of Bafta since February 2010.
