Laura Muir: Scot has no regrets over Olympic 1500m final strategy

Laura Muir says she has no regrets about going for Olympic 1500m gold despite believing she could have won a medal with a different race strategy.

The Scot, 23, is "really happy" she "went for gold" in Rio despite slipping from third to seventh in the last 200m.
"Had I run the last part of the race a bit more conservatively, I think I could definitely have come through for bronze or possibly silver," she said.
"But I would always be thinking, 'Could I have got the gold?'"
Muir travelled to Brazil with high hopes of a medal after breaking Kelly Holmes' British 1500m record in London a few weeks before the Games.
But after taking up the pace and leading after two laps, she saw Kenya's Faith Kipyegon and six other athletes surge past her on the home straight.
The Scot swiftly put the setback behind her, however, knocking another two seconds off her British record in winning in Paris on 27 August with a world-leading time this year.
She then became the first Scot, and only the third British woman, to win a Diamond League series of races. She earned Â£30,000 after clinching the title with a second place finish in Zurich on 1 September.

"The Diamond League is the elite of the elite," she told BBC Scotland. "A lot of people that win them are Olympic or world medallists so to win the overall title is so surreal. I can't believe it.
"We didn't target the Diamond League as such. We just did the races to fit my training schedules and for peaking in Rio. I didn't run a few of them, so to come away with the title, I am so shocked really."
Muir wrapped up her season by winning the mile race at the Great North City Games last Saturday.
And with the World Championships coming to London next summer, she has another major target to aim for.
But as well as winter training, she will spend the next few months focusing on her studies, having passed her fourth year of veterinary school earlier this summer.
"I think I can carry it on," she added. "I am very lucky that I have a very supportive school. The University of Glasgow Veterinary School have been great in allowing me to juggle things and I just hope when I graduate, I would like to continue doing both.
"I never dreamed of being a full-time athlete. I know at any point it could finish.
"You hope it doesn't happen but you never know when you might knacker your knee, and that is you [finished]. I think it's very important to have that career and something other than athletics."
