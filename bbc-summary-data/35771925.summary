School Report 2016: News Day shout outs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of students are taking part in School Report's 2016 News Day on Thursday 10 March, and this is the place to find messages of support, encouragement and congratulations for pupils across the UK from their schools and teachers!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
We try to use as many as possible, but with so many schools taking part it's very hard to get every single one mentioned so please bear with us.
See if you can find your school's shout out here:
