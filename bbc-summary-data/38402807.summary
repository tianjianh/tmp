[SN]TITLE[SN]
New waste charges given go-ahead by Conwy council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charges for disposing of non-household waste will be introduced in Conwy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Council officers had said the move could raise Â£120,000 to boost coffers, although "concerns about fly-tipping will be raised".
There were 1,069 incidents of flytipping in the county in 2015-16 - an increase of 90 compared to the previous year.
The policy, agreed by councillors, covers non-household waste such as rubble, plasterboard and tyres.
Officers said charges would be "less than the hire of a private skip", while the disposal of household waste, such as beds and wardrobes, remains free.
