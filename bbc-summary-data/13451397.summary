The single father from Glasgow, who wishes to remain anonymous, hit the jackpot with a seven-horse accumulator.
The man, who has not worked for five years after heart surgery, said he was shocked and said his brain was "a wreck".
He intends to buy his own home and visit his sisters abroad.
He said: "I'm shocked. I regularly place these little bets and everyone tells me I'm mad.
"I've hit the bar a few times but this is incredible.
"My brain was a wreck and I couldn't understand the balance on my account. I first thought it would pay about £21,000 and had to get my son to come and translate that the numbers meant I'd actually won £353,000."
The lucky winner placed his 50p each-way accumulator on seven horses running at Brighton, Nottingham, Towcester and Kempton.
A spokesman for William Hill said: "He's our luckiest ever punter."
