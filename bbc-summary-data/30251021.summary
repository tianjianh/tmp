Judges commended Brodies for the quality of its legal services, growth in the Scottish legal market and track record for winning new business.
The British Legal Awards ceremony, which was hosted by Legal Week magazine, recognises the achievements of lawyers and firms across Europe.
This is the second consecutive win at the British Legal Awards for Brodies.
In 2013, it was named Regional Law Firm of the Year.
Announcing the award, the judging panel said: "Strong growth in client numbers, headcount and turnover have cemented this firm's position as a leading firm in its market."
Bill Drummond, managing partner of Brodies, said: "We're obviously delighted to be singled out in this way and would like to thank the large number of knowledgeable people - peers, experts, clients and commentators - who have experienced or taken a look at what we do.
"We'll continue to put clients at the heart of all we do and aim to ensure that if they're doing business in or from Scotland, they find us relevant, reliable and rigorous in representing their interests from start to finish."
Brodies, which runs offices in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Brussels, offers legal advice to private and public sector clients both in the UK and abroad.
