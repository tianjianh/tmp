Taylor, 25, featured in the third Test against Pakistan - his first cap since playing against South Africa in 2012.
"It was frustrating. The phone calls I had thinking I had been picked for a tour and it was 'no, sorry James you haven't been picked again', he said.
"But I used it as a positive. I tried to use it as kick up the backside."
The Nottinghamshire batsman, who was dropped after averaging 16 in his first two Tests in 2012, scored 76 in the first innings of his Test return in November.
He has also been selected to tour South Africa. later this month.
Taylor paid tribute to the staff and fellow players at Trent Bridge for helping him earn his latest call-up, having averaged 49.55 for Nottinghamshire in the County Championship this summer, including a career-best 291 against Sussex.
"Nottinghamshire is where I've had to score my runs and I've done that," Taylor told BBC East Midlands Today.
"I owe a lot to the coaching staff and players that have helped me along the way."
