Molly-Mae Wotherspoon was attacked by an American pit-bull at a house in Daventry, Northamptonshire in 2014.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said the RSPCA had reported concerns about the dog but the officer failed to take appropriate action.
Northamptonshire Police said officers have received further training.

The IPCC said a second officer, who also allegedly failed to act on the intelligence received, was found to have no case to answer.
A Northamptonshire Police spokeswoman said: "The officers identified by the Professional Standards investigation have since received the appropriate management words of advice
"Within weeks of the tragedy, we instigated new and robust operational procedures around dangerous dogs.
"Now, nearly two years on, the public should be reassured that officers have far greater awareness around this issue."
Molly-Mae's mother and grandmother were jailed for two years each on Thursday.
Claire Riley, 23, admitted owning a dangerously out of control dog and Susan Aucott, 55, admitted being in charge of one.
Jailing them, judge Mrs Justice Carr told the pair Molly-Mae was savagely attacked by the pit bull in "a tragic and totally avoidable incident".
James House, prosecuting, said the pit bull broke free from his cage in the kitchen and opened the door to the lounge to reach baby Molly-Mae on the floor.
The court heard that the baby's cries made it "an object of prey".
A vet who treated the American pit bull - a breed banned in the UK - said the dog, named Bruiser, was one of the most dangerous dogs she had seen.
