Leading jockeys say the racing world will continue to rally for Freddy Tylicki after a fund for the injured rider topped more than £250,000.

Tylicki, 30, was paralysed from the waist down following a four-horse pile-up at Kempton on 31 October.
Frankie Dettori said he was "in a state of shock" over the "terrible accident" to his friend and neighbour.
"My thoughts are with Freddy," said the three-time champion jockey. "Such a young man with a great future."
According to the Injured Jockeys Fund (IJF), Tylicki remains in intensive care at St George's Hospital in Tooting.
Dettori, who said all jockeys knew racing was dangerous, added that he and his fellow jockeys would be there to help Tylicki "through this bad time".
At The Races presenter Matt Chapman set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for Tylicki's recovery.
The money will go towards a charitable fund, set up by the rider's family.
Olympic cyclist-turned-amateur jockey Victoria Pendleton reflected on Tylicki's injury at the annual Cartier Racing Awards on Tuesday.
Pendleton said: "It's a really great camaraderie between the riders because they appreciate every ride could be their last.
"If you look at the odds, it's not as dangerous as some people think. But you'd be crazy if you didn't have a long hard think about that and it didn't affect you."
Leading flat jockey Ryan Moore described it as a "terribly sad situation" in a "dangerous sport", but added that jockeys push that to the back of their minds.
