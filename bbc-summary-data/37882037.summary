[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
National League leading goalscorer Ricky Miller stunned Solihull as he scored a second-half hat-trick for 10-man Dover as they came back from a goal down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dover's Jack Parkinson was sent off for bringing down Solihull's Andy Brown, as the striker was through on goal.
The hosts took advantage of the extra man and took the lead moments before half time as Brown scored his fifth goal of the season, heading home from a corner.
Miller scored a quick-fire double to give Dover the lead, before completing his hat-trick with a quarter-of-an-hour left - his 19th goal of the season.
Solihull made it 3-2 in stoppage time as Akwasi Asante scored his eighth goal of the season but it was too late for The Moors.
Report supplied by the Press Association.
New Solihull Moors head coach Keith Bertschin told BBC WM: "You've got to find your way in the first period of the game and I thought we hung in really well.
"The game changed a little bit when they had the man sent off and we got the goal, and not getting the second goal was the thing that undone us.
"We tried to make them aware of not being loose and thinking the game was over at half-time, but we never really got going, they got their tails up and we gave a couple of poor goals away.
"When that momentum changes - we've seen it so many times at all different levels of football - it's very powerful and we could never get back into the game."
