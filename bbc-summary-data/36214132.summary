Barnet have made Tom Champion, Ben Tomlinson, Shaun Batt and Mauro Vilhete available on free transfers.

Champion, 29, has made 30 appearances this season and been captain, but has been told his future lies elsewhere.
Tomlinson, 26, spent much of the season out on loan, while former Peterborough striker Batt, 29, has not been a first-team regular.
Neither has 22-year-old wide-man Vilhete, who spent part of the campaign on loan at Boreham Wood.
Vilhete scored both goals in the 2-0 win against Gateshead which clinched Barnet's promotion back to the Football League last year.
"Mauro Vilhete is always going to be a legend at this football club for scoring those goals," manager Martin Allen told the Bees' website.
"So it's with a heavy heart that I feel that Mauro needs to go out and play more first-team football. He's a terrific lad that is very popular, and it's a sad decision that I've got to make.
"Tom Champion has done really well for us through this season. But I just feel that we need to make some changes this summer.
"He's a great captain and a great person to have around the place. I really like him, but I do need to try to move the whole thing forward.
"Ben has also been made available for a free transfer to find himself a new club, get playing, and get goals under his belt. I know he can do it.
"I've also spoken to Shaun Batt. He is an absolute diamond of a bloke - you couldn't wish to meet a better person than Shaun Batt. He's great in the dressing room and he has been fantastic in training. I think he needs someone to give him a break."
