[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kolo Toure may feature in Celtic's home leg against Astana

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic defender Kolo Toure may feature in next week's return leg against Astana after being registered with Uefa for the Champions League qualifier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Toure, 35, has not travelled to Kazakhstan for Wednesday's third qualifying round first leg after joining Celtic on Sunday.
However, the registration allows him to feature when Astana visit Celtic Park next week.
Boss Brendan Rodgers is without several central defenders for Wednesday's game.
Injuries mean Kristoffer Ajer, Dedryck Boyata, Jozo Simunovic and Erik Sviatchenko will not feature in Kazakhstan.
Eoghan O'Connell, 20, played and scored in Celtic's friendly with Leicester City on Saturday and Efe Ambrose and Mikael Lustig are other options at the heart of defence for Rodgers.
Toure previously worked with Rodgers at Liverpool and won Premier League titles with both Arsenal and Manchester City.
