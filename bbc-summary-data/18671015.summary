Cheaper mobile charges in place

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New rules to prevent "bill shock" when using mobile data in Europe have come into force.

Data will now no longer cost more than 70 cents (56p) per megabyte - far less than previous rates.
Meanwhile, calls will be capped at 29c (23p) per minute, plus VAT, under the new rules.
The EU said the regulations were aimed at stopping people build up huge bills after making calls and using data applications, such as maps, while away.
However, price comparison website Uswitch.com warned that no such caps existed for those travelling outside Europe and networks may not alert users if they rack up huge bills.
From 2014, consumers will also be able to choose a different operator abroad in the EU from the one they use at home, under the EU rules.
It is hoped this split-network approach will encourage greater competition.
