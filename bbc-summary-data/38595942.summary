Winnall joined the Tykes from Scunthorpe in July 2014, but would have been out of contract in summer.
The 25-year-old scored 48 goals in 116 games for the club, including 11 in 22 Championship appearances this season.
He is available to make his Owls debut when they host Huddersfield Town on Saturday.
"Can't wait to get started and help this club back up to where it belongs!" Winnall posted on Twitter.
Wednesday are currently sixth in the Championship, but 10 points adrift of the automatic promotion places, with Barnsley eighth.
Winnall helped Barnsley win the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and League One play-off final at Wembley last season, and in a message to the club's supporters, he said he would "never forget the memories we shared".
Meanwhile, Barnsley have announced that chief executive Linton Brown has left the club.
