[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Atletico Madrid kept alive their hopes of winning La Liga with their biggest league win of the season against Real Betis.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Liverpool and Chelsea striker Fernando Torres opened the scoring with a lovely dinked finish.
Antoine Griezmann doubled the lead before right-back Juanfran made it 3-0.
Ruben Castro reduced the deficit before late goals by Griezmann and substitute Thomas Partey completed the rout and earned a fifth win in six league games.
The win leaves Diego Simeone's side six points behind leaders Barcelona, who are in action later in the day against third-placed Real Madrid.
Atletico's next game is away to Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Tuesday.
