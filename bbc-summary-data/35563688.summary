Welsh triathlete Non Stanford says she is not concerned about competing at the Olympics in Brazil following the outbreak of the Zika virus.

Kenya threatened to pull out if the Zika virus reaches "epidemic levels".
There are also concerns about water pollution in Rio de Janeiro, but Stanford is happy to represent Great Britain.
"I know that health and safety would never be compromised," she told BBC Wales Sport.
"The medical representatives from Team GB have been in touch to reassure us that they will do everything possible to make sure we're not affected by these issues.
"If by the time the Games come around there is a serious threat, then I'm sure the necessary steps will be taken to make sure we don't come into any harm."
Stanford earned her place in the Great Britain triathlon team by finishing second at the World Triathlon Grand Final in Chicago in September 2015.
The 2012 World Under-23 champion Stanford won the senior title the following year.
But injuries ruled Stanford out of most of the 2014 season, including the Commonwealth Games, and began her bid to win selection for Rio at the ITU event in Yokohama in May 2015.
That campaign ended successfully in Chicago where fellow Welshwoman Helen Jenkins finished 11th.
