A head teacher has been suspended after allegations a pupil was allowed to sit a GCSE exam a day early.

Colin Williams, head of Moreton School in Bushbury, Wolverhampton, is facing an independent investigation.
GCSEs can only be taken at different times in exceptional circumstances, an exams boards body said.
The school's governors said they were treating the allegations "very seriously" and the head had been suspended for the time being.
The school's governing body is due to appoint an investigator to look at the claims and the exact circumstances surrounding them.
Wolverhampton City Council said it would not comment on allegations the pupil was going on holiday the intended day of the exam.
A spokesperson for the local authority said there was currently no timetable for when the investigator would report back.
Rob Hewer, chair of governors, said he hoped the investigation could be concluded "quickly and efficiently".
He said the welfare of pupils was "of paramount importance" and an acting head had been appointed.
The school was expected to be supported by both the city council and a neighbouring school, Mr Hewer said.
He added the governing body would not comment further until the investigation had concluded.
The Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ), which represents the UK's largest exam boards, said pupils were only allowed to sit exams at different times if papers clashed or they required extra time due to access arrangements.
Even then, it said the exam had to be taken "on the same day".
The JCQ said holiday plans, weddings, work experience, and sporting events were not suitable reasons for altering the exam timetable.
Legislation introduced in 2013 means pupils are only allowed to take holiday in term time in exceptional circumstances and with the school's permission.
