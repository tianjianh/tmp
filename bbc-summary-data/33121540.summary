Police were called to St Stephens Street subway in Norwich at about 07:00 BST on Wednesday after a man named locally as Sergio was found collapsed.
David Peel, during a vigil for Sergio organised by Class War 2015, said he understood Sergio's sleeping bag may have been taken before his death.
Norfolk Police, which is yet to comment on the theft claim, said the death was not thought suspicious.
Mr Peel, who organised the vigil, said: "There are very few details around at the moment. He was sleeping rough in this awful underpass on very cold nights.
"What is to blame is our system and our society which put Sergio here."
Norfolk Police said the death was being treated as unexplained.
