Martyn Matthews, a father of two grown-up children, is thought to have been travelling to Germany for a meeting.
The Airbus A320 crashed in France on Tuesday after an eight-minute rapid descent. There were no survivors.
The family of the senior quality manager said they were "devastated at the news of this tragic incident".
In a statement issued through the Foreign Office, his wife, Sharon, and children Jade and Nathan, asked to be allowed to deal with "this terrible news without intrusion at this difficult time".
Margaret Goodyear, a neighbour and former colleague of Mr Matthews, said he was a "lovely, lovely man".
Police officers have been stationed outside Mr Matthews' home in the Old Hall Park area of Wolverhampton.
The Germanwings flight came down in a remote mountain valley, close to the village of Seyne-les-Alpes. It was en route from Barcelona in Spain to Duesseldorf in Germany.
Officials say that the plane's cockpit voice recorder has arrived in Paris for investigators to examine.
The "black box" is believed to be damaged but officials still hope to retrieve data from it.
Officials believe 67 of the 144 passengers on the plane were German citizens, including 16 pupils returning from an exchange trip.
At least three Britons died in crash, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said.
