Ziggy Worrell-Owusu, from Hackney, was attacked at the Basement Shisha Lounge in Goodmayes Road, Ilford, in the early hours of Thursday, the Met Police said.
He was celebrating his friend's 18th birthday and was attacked during a row, police said.
He was taken to hospital but pronounced dead at 01:45 BST. Post-mortem tests found he died from a single stab wound.
No arrests have been made, police said.
Ten teenagers have been stabbed to death in London this year.
A Met Police spokesman said: "It has been established that Ziggy had attended an 18th birthday party with a group of his friends at the venue and there were approximately 100 people in attendance.
"At some point during the evening an altercation occurred which led to Ziggy being stabbed."
