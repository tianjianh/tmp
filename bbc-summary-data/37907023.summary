'Border Fox' O'Hare facing extradition to Dublin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former INLA man Dessie O'Hare, once known as the 'Border Fox', is facing extradition proceedings to the Republic of Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was arrested in County Armagh shortly after 06:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Mr O'Hare, 60, is wanted over alleged offences including grievous bodily harm, false imprisonment, threats to kill and violent disorder
The offences are alleged to have happened in Dublin on 9 June 2015.
Mr O'Hare appeared in court around lunchtime and spoke only to confirm his name.
A lawyer for Dublin High Court said the offences involved are serious.
He said Mr O'Hare is accused of being the leader of a gang that carried out the offences.
The court was told his co-accused is Declan Duffy, who is currently in custody in the Republic awaiting trial.
Objecting to bail, the lawyer said that the defendant was a flight risk.
He is alleged to have run off after the incident with five others.
The lawyer said there is strong evidence in the case including CCTV footage and witnesses.
A lawyer acting for Dessie O'Hare said his client posed no flight risk as he was married with children and grandchildren.
He had a home that was worth between Â£200,000 and Â£300,000 in County Armagh and a handyman business.
He said his client also had a number of agricultural interests including a mushroom factory that he needed to tend.
The court heard that his Irish passport had been seized but enquirers were ongoing to establish if he had a British passport.
The judge said a bail hearing could take place on Friday once the passport issue and other matters were clarified.
A full extradition hearing will take place on 9 December.
Mr O'Hare was previously sentenced to 40 years for kidnapping but he was released in 2006 after court ruling that he met terms of early release under Good Friday Agreement.
