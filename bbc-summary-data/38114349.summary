[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 3-1 St Mirren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Falkirk came from behind to move third in the Championship, adding to the misery of bottom club St Mirren, who remain without a league win this term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Morgan fired Saints ahead but the visitors had Jack Baird sent off for throwing a punch before the interval.
Lee Miller levelled early in the second half, turning in a low cross from Myles Hippolyte, via the post.
Bob McHugh and Hippolyte then earned the Bairns maximum points with strikes inside the closing 12 minutes.
St Mirren, without a point since October, started in bright fashion and Kyle McAllister had an early effort that drifted wide of Danny Rogers' goal.
And when the breakthrough came, it was a goal of outstanding quality.
John Sutton knocked the ball down into the path of Morgan, who took one touch and blasted the ball high into the net from 18 yards.
The St Mirren defence were coping admirably with all that was being thrown at them before Baird was shown a straight red card after a clash with Falkirk striker Miller.
Within two minutes of the second half Falkirk were back on terms, with Miller applying the finishing touch.
Despite being a man down, St Mirren looked dangerous on the break but they could not find a way through.
Falkirk eventually made their personnel advantage count with McHugh on target from close range after good work by Miller.
And victory was secured when Hippolyte evaded a couple of challenges to create space to crash in a shot from 12 yards and lift his side up two places in the table.
