[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ian Brunner, 47, and John-Mark Duffy were both part of Bedford's "town centre drinking community", Luton Crown Court heard.
Brunner admitted murdering Mr Duffy, 39, at a flat in Byron Crescent, Bedford, in January.
Judge Richard Foster said Brunner must serve at least 12-and-a-half years before becoming eligible for parole.
The court heard both men had ended up in the flat with a third man, Steve Matthews.
Anne Evans, prosecuting, said: "At some point Mr Matthews remembers Mr Duffy asking Ian to make a joint. It seems he couldn't find any and Mr Duffy started to get agitated."
Brunner and Mr Duffy argued in the hallway before returning to the living room, grappling one another, the court heard.
Mr Duffy lifted his shirt and told Mr Matthews he had been stabbed.
Brunner left the flat and Mr Duffy died at the scene.
Brunner told police Mr Duffy had been his friend and he had not intended to kill him.
