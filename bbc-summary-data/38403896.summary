Jermaine Grandison: Colchester United sign former Shrewsbury Town defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United have signed defender Jermaine Grandison until the end of the season after he impressed during a trial at the League Two club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grandison, 26, left Shrewsbury Town in July and previously had spells at Coventry City and Tranmere Rovers.
He won two promotions from League Two during his time at Shrewsbury.
"I had a few moves on the horizon, but I just needed a bit of time to work on myself and have a little bit of time away," he told BBC Essex.
"I've had a few promotions at Shrewsbury and I think you need a little bit of experience in the team to help the younger ones in a few tough games, when you've got your backs against the wall."
He made 175 appearances for the Shrews, with 83 of them coming after he re-signed for them in December 2013, six months after rejecting a contract.
