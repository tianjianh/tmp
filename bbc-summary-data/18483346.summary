[SN]TITLE[SN]
Parking charge introduced at Brighton's Preston Park

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parking charges and a six-hour maximum time limit are being introduced in Brighton's Preston Park to stop it being used by commuters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brighton and Hove City Council said the charge was to tackle the problem of commuters using Preston Park as a free all-day car park.
The move follows a petition signed by more than 2,000 people, protesting over the number of cars in the park.
It will cost 50p per hour, rising to Â£3 for between three and six hours.
