Mr Freeman said benefits should go to "really disabled people" not those "taking pills at home, who suffer from anxiety".
The Labour leader recalled a speech Theresa May once made to the Tory conference and said Mr Freeman's remarks were "proof that the nasty party is still around".
The prime minister said Mr Freeman had "rightly" apologised for the remarks and accused the last Labour government of doing "nothing" to give mental health parity with physical health care.
