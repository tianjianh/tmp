They finished third at the Rio World Cup with 308.82 points, behind China (344.04) and Malaysia (318.90).
It is the sixth berth British Diving has attained for Rio, with five secured through results at the 2015 World Championships in Russia.
GB will aim for six further berths over the weekend.
Tom Daley and new partner Dan Goodfellow will bid to qualify for a place in the Olympic men's synchronised 10m event on Saturday.
Couch and Barrow were required to finish in the top four among nations who had not already qualified for the Rio Olympics.
China were the only country which had attained a place for Rio 2016 in attendance at the World Cup, with Canada and North Korea skipping the competition.
Couch and Barrow finished fifth at the London 2012 Olympics and won Commonwealth silver for England at Glasgow 2014.
However, with Barrow struggling with shin injuries over the past two years, British Diving performance director Alexei Evangulov broke up the pairing late last year.
Couch was partnered by rising star Lois Toulson for the National Cup in January, but they failed to impress and, with Barrow excelling individually at the event, the decision was made to restore her to the synchronised line-up.
The selectors are not expected to decide which pair will represent GB at Rio until after the British trials in June.
