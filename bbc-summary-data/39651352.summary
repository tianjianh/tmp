Welshman Ryan Day has described his World Championship defeat to China's Xiao Guodong as "embarrassing".

Day, Wales' sole representative at this year's Championship at Sheffield's Crucible, was beaten 10-4 in the first round.
The 37-year-old recovered from 4-0 down to trail 4-3 but won only one more frame and as a result will now drop out of the world's top 16.
"My form is OK but my concentration let me down," Day told BBC Wales Sport.
"It was a poor start and although my form was not too bad it was a bit of an embarrassing day at the office.
"I just never settled. I lost the first frame that I should have won. I got back into the match at 4-3 and let the last two frames slip.
"Xiao started quite well [in the evening session] and it was too much of a lead."
Day's defeat means there will be no Welsh representation in the second round of the World Championship for the first time since 1969.
