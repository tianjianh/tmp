[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has agreed to meet a nurse whose daughter has tried to kill herself after failing to get the right treatment for depression.

Nurse Sarah Hardy said the 18-year-old's treatment had been "dreadful" and she had not had a mental health assessment over six months, Coventry North West MP Geoffrey Robinson stated.
Mr Hunt said it was "not good enough" and he was "more than happy to meet".
The trust said it had contacted the family to try and resolve the issue.
Labour MP Mr Robinson read out a letter from Mrs Hardy, a nurse with 26 years' experience, in the Commons.
"I'm somebody who works in the NHS so I understand the strains the service is under," it said.
"But I also expect as a family who gave so much to society and still do, when it is our time of need, we can expect a service that meets our needs."
Mr Hunt responded he would like "to try and look at the particular issue as to why she's having to wait so long".
He told the Commons: "I mean, we owe a huge debt to people like that and what she is describing in terms of her own... daughter's treatment is just not satisfactory. It's not good enough."
Mrs Hardy said later: "This is a staffing issue, this is a funding issue, this is an availability issue rather than an attack on the mental health teams.
"By speaking out I want this to improve services for other people and I just want my daughter to get better."
Simon Gilby, Chief Executive of Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust, said staff worked hard to "respond promptly and appropriately" to referrals.
The trust is trying to resolve "any wait for care" felt by the family, he said.
