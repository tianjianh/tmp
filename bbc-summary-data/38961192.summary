Britain's most senior police chief has called for "less suspicion and more trust" in officers who carry guns, in his final speech before retirement.

Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) that firearm officers needed greater public support.
He also revealed that despite a push for more armed officers, there were not enough people willing to do the role.
Sir Bernard is retiring after more than five and a half years in the post.
During the speech, the Met's commissioner said public pressure on firearm officers had meant "we simply don't have enough people now wanting to do these jobs".
"This a dangerous place to be... we can't afford to have officers think twice because they fear the consequences of shooting someone".
"That's how they get shot or the public gets hurt or a criminal gets away with a gun," he said.
Sir Bernard also stated that armed officers did not fire a shot at a suspect in more than 3,300 incidents involving firearms in 2016.
"It's an urban myth that officers are trigger-happy," he said.
The Met has said it will increase firearm officer numbers by 600, with more than 400 extra staff trained or selected to date.
According to a staff survey, nearly half of Met Police officers believe more officers should carry guns.
