Michael Turner hid his glazed creations around Lymington and posted clues to their whereabouts on his Facebook page.
He asked those who found them to make a donation to the Royal British Legion.
The artist said he came up with the idea after his parents gave him a box of World War Two memorabilia which had belonged to his grandfathers.
He said he had also been inspired by last year's ceramic poppies art installation at the Tower of London.
Memorabilia in the box included medals, photographs and a certificate of outstanding service.
"It had quite a big impact on me just how much they went through," Mr Turner said.
He created 11 poppies because it was a "poignant number" for Armistice Day, which marks the end of World War One on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month each year.
He said he did not want to benefit "in any way", and instead said it was "about sending a message".
Sian Morris, who found the first of the poppies, said: "So pleased to have found such a beautiful piece of artwork, especially something with such meaning. Just going to make my donation now."
Annabel Cook said her 10-year-old daughter Edie Keates, who found another of the sculptures, was "thrilled" and was going to make a donation from her own savings.
