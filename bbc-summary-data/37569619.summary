The hotel was the location for two police raids in 2015.
The raids saw a number of members from football's world governing body arrested in connection with bribery and corruption allegations.
As part of a cost saving exercise, Fifa Council members are to be relocated when they attend a key meeting later this month.
Officials, including England's David Gill, will not have to suffer too much though. They will now stay at the equally high-end Park Hyatt, another five-star residence located nearby.
The luxury Baur au Lac has been a favourite of football's world governing body for many years.
The service and discretion of its staff was famously highlighted when they held up white tablecloths to hide the identities of arrested executives during the first early morning raid in May 2015.
Fifa is under pressure to save money after losing a number of sponsors and incurring expensive legal bills in the wake of investigations led by the Swiss Attorney General and the US Department of Justice.
