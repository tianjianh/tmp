Women's Rugby: Wales 43-5 UK Armed Forces

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales made the most of a flying start to beat the UK Armed Forces 43-5 in a special Armistice Day match at the Arms Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dyddgu Hywel, Mel Clay and Sioned Harries all crossed in the first eight minutes with Alisha Butchers' try making it 24-0 at the break.
Clay again. Jess Kavanagh-Williams and Elen Evans added second-half tries with Elinor Snowsill converting four.
RAF and Wales full-back Charlie Murray scored a late Forces consolation.
Clay's second after 51 minutes was the pick of the bunch as the rangy lock ran in from a Keira Bevan break out of defence.
It was a second Wales victory of the month after beating Scotland 15-0, as they prepare for the Six Nations and 2017 World Cup.
Woman of the match Elinor Snowsill told BBC Wales Sport:
"I'm chuffed with the performance of the whole squad, we scored tries early on, then we had a 20-minute period where we switched off, but we came back out, finished the game off and scored some nice tries.
"It's a massive positive that we threw on a lot of subs, we made a lot of positional changes, and still kept our structure.
"We're really thankful for the chance (to play autumn internationals), it gives us time to work on different combinations, and you blow out the cobwebs to keep moving forward into the Six Nations and World Cup.
"I only switched to left-foot (goal) kicking two weeks ago, I'd always struggled with my right foot kicking for the posts, so I gave the left a go and it worked."
