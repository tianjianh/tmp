The singer says she asked her mum to go for a health check-up at Christmas, when doctors found the disease.
Writing on her Tumblr page, Swift said they were keeping the exact details private.
"I'm writing to you with an update I wish I wasn't giving you, but it's important and I'm used to sharing important events in my life with you," she said.
"Usually when things happen to me, I process them and then write music about how I feel, and you hear it much later. This is something my family and I thought you should know about now.
"For Christmas this year, I asked my mom that one of her gifts to me be her going to the doctor to get screened for any health issues, just to ease some worries of mine.
"She agreed, and went in to get checked. There were no red flags and she felt perfectly fine, but she did it just to get me and my brother off her case about it.
"The results came in, and I'm saddened to tell you that my mom has been diagnosed with cancer. I'd like to keep the details of her condition and treatment plans private, but she wanted you to know."
Taylor Swift grew up in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania before moving to Nashville aged 14 to start her career in country music.
Her mother has been with her all the way and are often pictured together.
Andrea often accompanies her on tour as well.
Taylor Swift's song The Best Day is written for and dedicated to Taylor's mother, who also features in the video, which is a compilation of home movies and ends with the words, "I love you Mom".
Andrea Swift is also in the videos for I'm Only Me When I'm With You and Beautiful Eyes.
Swift said she hoped sharing the news might help other people.
"She wanted you to know because your parents may be too busy juggling everything they've got going on to go to the doctor, and maybe you reminding them to go get checked for cancer could possibly lead to an early diagnosis and an easier battle.
"Or peace of mind in knowing that they're healthy and there's nothing to worry about.
"She wanted you to know why she may not be at as many shows this tour. She's got an important battle to fight.
"Thank you for caring about my family so much that she would want me to share this information with you.
"I hope and pray that you never get news like this."
