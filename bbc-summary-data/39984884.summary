Brynglas tunnels close eastbound until Monday for work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The M4 motorway will be closed at the Brynglas tunnels eastbound from Saturday night until Monday morning.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is for refurbishment and forms part of upgrading work that is ongoing until February 2018.
The closure lasts from 20:00 BST on Saturday until 06:00 Monday.
Traffic Wales said the A48 Southern Distributor Road around Newport is the dedicated diversion route but local people can use other alternatives.
Motorists travelling westbound will be unaffected by the work.
