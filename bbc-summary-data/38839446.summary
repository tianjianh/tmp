Hartlepool's Dave Jones concerned about lack of British-owned club and managers

Hartlepool United boss Dave Jones believes there might not be a "British coach at the top end of football in this country or a British-owned club" in five to 10 years.

At present, there are seven British bosses out of 20 in the Premier League and 18 from 24 Championship clubs.
Jones said: "In five to 10 years, you'd be surprised if there's a British-owned club in the top two divisions.
"And, bringing in foreign owners, they're bringing foreign coaches."
Jones highlighted the number of Midlands clubs under foreign ownership, with Aston Villa, Birmingham City, West Brom and Wolves each having recently been taken over by Chinese investors.
"I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm not having a go - but it's a trend that's going on in our country at the moment and it's what I believe," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live.

Chinese firm Trillion Trophy Asia (TTA) completed its acquisition of Championship side Birmingham in October and replaced Englishman Gary Rowett with Italian Gianfranco Zola.
Zola has since failed to win any of his 10 matches in charge and the Blues have dropped from seventh to 12 in the Championship.
"Gary was doing a good job but the owners decided they felt they would bring in another manager that wants to do it their way," said Jones.
"They do own the club and they are entitled to do whatever they want. It was just a bit harsh on Gary - a good manager, working hard, up-and-coming.
"There are a lot of good British managers out of work but if you look at all the top divisions around the world and see how many foreign coaches are in maybe Germany, France, Italy, more of their own nations are running the clubs."
Jones also mentioned Wolves and Aston Villa replacing Italians Walter Zenga and Roberto Di Matteo with Paul Lambert, of Scotland, and Englishman Steve Bruce respectively.
"Lambert knows the team, knows the league, is a good manager," he said. "The same with Steve Bruce - the manager they have had has failed and, all of a sudden, they bring in someone who knows the league and has done OK."
Jones took over at League Two Hartlepool in January in his first managerial job since 2013.
"I have a lot of friends who are foreign managers and they have brought a lot to us," added Jones.
"But being out of work as a manager and a coach I bumped into a lot of coaches who felt the same, that we weren't getting the opportunities that we used to and that might just be because there are a lot of foreign-owned clubs who want to go with what they know rather than people in this country."
Burnley boss Sean Dyche and Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce have both previously stated their belief that foreign managers are viewed as "sexier".
"Antonio Conte came in at Chelsea and he got commended for bringing a hard, fast, new leadership to Chelsea, which involved doing 800m runs, 400m runs and 200m runs," said Dyche in August last year.
"I thought that was interesting because if you see us doing that you'd say we're running them round in circles - 'a young English dinosaur manager. Doesn't know what he's doing'.
"At Chelsea under Conte everyone thinks it's amazing."
Former England manager Allardyce has also voiced his concern about this issue in May 2016, saying there could be no English managers in the Premier League "very shortly" if current trends continue.
"It always goes to what seems a sexier version than we are. That is, a foreign coach, which I think is a great shame," Allardyce told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek.
"Every time a job becomes available nobody goes down to League One.
"None of the foreign coaches are trained or equipped any better than we are but unless we get the opportunity to get interviewed, which is rare now, particularly for young managers, a manager getting into the Premier League now that is English or British would have to do it via getting promoted through the Championship."
