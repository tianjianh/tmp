French terror attacks: Victim obituaries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twelve people died when a bloody attack was launched on the office of France's satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The following day a policewoman was murdered by Amedy Coulibaly, who held up a Jewish supermarket the next day, killing four people. Here are brief profiles of all 17 victims.

"Charb" was 47. He had received death threats in the past and had been under police protection.
A stout defender of the left-wing magazine's provocative approach, he refused to bow to critics.
"I don't have kids, no wife, no car, no debt," he once told France's Le Monde newspaper. "Maybe it's a little pompous to say, but I'd rather die standing than live on my knees."
Mr Charbonnier's partner, Jeannette Bougrab, told the BBC she rushed to the magazines offices after Wednesday's attack to find out if he was dead.
A former government minister, Ms Bougrab told the BBC's Fergal Keane they had discussed the possibility he might be targeted.
