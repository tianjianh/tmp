Lamara Bell, 25, was found conscious inside the car near Stirling on 5 July but died in hospital four days later.
Her partner John Yuill, 28, died in the crash which was reported to police but not followed up.
Ms Bell's brother Martin said police investigations revealed she was able to speak to rescuers when they found her.
In a post on Facebook, Mr Bell said: "She was defo 100% conscious. She was able to tell them her name. She added 4 years on to her age and told them she was 29. She did also say she was only in the car for 20 mins.
He added: "They also said she was still moving around trying to get out the car but was trapped.
"Proud of my sis for doing so well over those three days then the following days in hospital for not giving up the fight. Brave amazing girl. She gave it her all and fought until the end."
Ms Bell, a mother of two from Falkirk, was found beside Mr Yuill in the couple's blue Renault Clio on 8 July.
The car, which had left a slip road and gone down an embankment, was reported to police on the day of the accident by a member of the public.
But the details were not entered into the police system.
It was eventually located by officers following up another call from a member of the public who had seen the vehicle.
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has ordered a review of all police call handling and the case is also the subject of an independent investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).
