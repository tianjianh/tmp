Can your GP help you recover from a cold or flu?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's winter - the cold and flu season. Accident and emergency departments are warning of increasing pressure on beds, and GPs' surgeries are fielding calls from sniffling patients desperate for quick fix. But just how sick should be before you make that call to your local health centre? Could a pharmacist help? And what exactly warrants a trip to A&E?

Accident and Emergency
Official advice suggests that A&E should only be used when an injury or illness is "serious or life-threatening".
In reality, patients often find it difficult to judge whether the pain they are suffering is "serious".
NHS 24's medical director, Professor George Crooks, urged people to use common sense.
"Falling ill can sometimes be a daunting experience, so it's important to know who to turn to if you or a family member are struck down in any way," he said.
"Normally a common sense approach is best. If you have just had an accident and have sustained an injury that results in a fracture, a serious cut which is gaping and will not stop bleeding, severe pain that will not ease off or a head injury that resulted in loss of consciousness  - these are good reasons for going to A&E.
"Other medical emergencies include severe breathlessness, a fit that is prolonged, a stroke, severe chest pain or uncontrolled bleeding. These are some of the examples that would merit A&E attendance."
Minor injuries unit
Cuts and minor burns, sprains and strains, as well as some broken bones and fractures can be treated at minor injuries units (MIUs) at local hospitals.
They are run by experienced emergency nurses who can assess and treat minor injuries.
In most cases, patients do not need to make an appointment and waiting times are generally half those at A&E departments.
And if staff discover that patients are suffering from a more serious problem, they can arrange for them to be transferred elsewhere.
GP surgeries and pharmacies
People with colds, flu and even the winter sickness bug should recover at home without visiting their GP, according to Prof Crooks.
He said: "In the winter months, it won't come as any surprise that we answer a high volume of queries on colds and flu, including the nasty norovirus.
"The best possible advice if you're feeling really unwell with this type of ailment is to stay at home, take paracetamol, drink plenty of fluids and rest.
"Although these illnesses can be miserable, it will get better and it's best not to spread viruses around."
When local health centres are closed, he said people should visit a pharmacist.
Prof Crooks said: "Many people do not know who to turn to when their doctor's surgery is closed. That's where local pharmacies come in.
"Pharmacists not only dispense medicine, they have a lot of knowledge and training on how to manage a range of common conditions.
"However, if you have concerns about your health that just won't go away, such as a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks, then it's best to wait until your surgery is open and make an appointment to see your GP."
NHS 24 and online information
People often fall ill or get injured outside of office hours, when GP surgeries and many pharmacies are closed.
That is where the NHS 24 helpline provides assistance to people who feel they are too ill to wait to speak to a health professional.
There are also a series of websites which are supported by NHS Scotland which can offer self-help advice.
Prof Crooks said: "If you have a condition which cannot wait until your GP surgery opens, then phone NHS 24 on 111. We answer a range of queries from all age groups, both young and old.
"We also provide extensive health information and advice in the form of our website www.nhsinform.scot. It has a number of tools and detailed information on all types of medical problems as well as the contact details of local pharmacies, GP surgeries, MIUs and emergency dentists.
"The information and self-help guides on the site make it easy for people to care for themselves when they need to, but it also provides signposting and reference to know who to turn to.
"Another website which is also useful is www.knowwhototurnto.org - this helps people distinguish between the services which are available and assists patients in making a decision on who best to contact when they feel unwell.
"If a sensible approach is followed, then self-help can help enormously. It can take the pressure off and help us assist those in need of urgent medical care."
