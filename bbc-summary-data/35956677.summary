Alex headed the home side in front from Mario Balotelli's corner.
Juve soon equalised, though, as Mario Mandzukic stroked a shot into the corner after receiving Alvaro Morata's perfectly-weighted return pass.
Balotelli had a goal ruled out for handball and then Pogba hit the post with a free-kick, before scoring.
The France midfielder chested down Claudio Marchisio's corner at the far post and thumped a shot into the ground, with the ball bouncing across goal and in.
Balotelli, recalled to Milan's starting line-up, had a mixed night, claiming an assist for his side's goal and testing keeper Gianluigi Buffon with a fine first-half free-kick before being booked.
The striker, who was substituted with 13 minutes left, received a yellow card for punching the ball into the net as it dropped loose after Buffon had made a great double save.
Milan's defeat leaves them in sixth place, while Juve's lead will be cut back to six points if second-placed Napoli beat bottom club Verona on Sunday.
Elsewhere in Serie A, Mauro Icardi's second-half goal ensured Inter Milan moved up to fourth with a 1-0 victory at next-to-bottom Frosinone, who finished with 10 men after defender Leonardo Blanchard was sent off late on.
Carpi remain outside the relegation zone only on goal difference after losing 1-0 at Chievo, while Genoa won 1-0 at Sassuolo in the day's other game.
