Friendlies in March have been confirmed at home to Northern Ireland and away against Ukraine.
Coleman's side will play one more friendly before their opening Euro 2016 group game against Slovakia in Bordeaux on 11 June.
"We'll come together in May and we're looking to play Sweden," Coleman told BBC Wales Sport.
"I'm 99% certain it's going to be Sweden, whether it's in Malmo or Gothenburg.
"That will be a tough test for us and on the back of that we'll fly straight to France and get ready for the big one.
"Ideally we would have had a home game but it's difficult with pitches at that time of year."
Wales will host fellow Euro 2016 finalists Northern Ireland on Thursday, 24 March at Cardiff City Stadium.
They face Ukraine at Kiev's NSK Olympiyskiy Stadium four days later .
