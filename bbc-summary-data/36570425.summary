[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £1.5m project to resurface a part of the M6 in Cumbria will start on Monday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The eight-week scheme will see work carried out by Highways England on all three carriageways between Millness and Carnforth.
Drainage repairs will also be made and extra protection installed to reduce the risk of bridge strikes along the 2.5 mile (4km) stretch of road.
Project manager Peter Gee said most of the work will be done overnight to minimise disruption for drivers.
He said: "These are important, if routine, wear and tear repairs to ensure drivers can continue to enjoy safe and smooth journeys along this section of the M6."
