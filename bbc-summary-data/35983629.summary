English debutant Andy Sullivan and Americans Rickie Fowler, Zach Johnson and Webb Simpson were among the others to shoot a hole-in-one.
Jimmy Walker, who won with a record eight-under 19, also carded an ace.
Sweden's David Lingmerth, Smylie Kaufman and fellow American Justin Thomas did likewise, the latter on the same hole as playing partner Fowler.
