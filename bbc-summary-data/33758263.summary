UK manufacturing growth picked up in July, a survey has suggested, after a 26-month low in June.

But growth remained "near stagnant", Markit said in its monthly UK Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing.
The index rose to 51.9 in July, from 51.4 in June. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
However, it remained below the average of 54.3 the sector has had since April 2013.
"Although an uptick in the headline PMI breaks the decelerating trend in UK manufacturing, growth remains near-stagnant and suggests that the sector is continuing to act as a drag on the economy," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
