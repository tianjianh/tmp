The actor, comedian and singer, who was born in Maesteg, south Wales, also appeared in shows including Coronation Street, Casualty and Open All Hours.
He died surrounded by his family on Tuesday.
Cardiff agents Emptage Hallett said Evans' "warmth, positivity and sense of humour made him a joy to work with".
In a statement, they said: "His love of life and brilliant sense of humour was inspirational.
"We are deeply upset. Howell was a hugely talented actor, a consummate professional and a lovely human being.
"Our thoughts go out to his wife Pat Kane and son Warwick Evans."
Evans' long entertainment career began with a spell as an impressionist touring the war zones from the age of 16.
On tour he met his wife, Pat Kane, a member of a dance group entertaining the troops.
After three years in the RAF, Evans emerged in 1949 to join the Carroll Lewis Discovery Show where he was introduced as "the star from the services".
His wife Pat joined him, and they soon became a comedy double act, working together for many years in music hall, variety, revue and pantomime.
When their son Warwick was born he was taken on tour with them until he went to school, and later followed them into the acting profession.
Evans' TV credits include Welsh favourites How Green Was My Valley and Satellite City, and he also appeared in TV classics, including Holby City and Softly, Softly and Z Cars.
He also played Grandpa Jack in The Story of Tracy Beaker and Mr Bolder in the BBC drama series The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.
The Ipcress File and An Englishman That Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain are among his film credits.
He also did a great deal of charity work and still performed his music hall revivals with his wife.
