[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three armed and masked men forced their way into a house on Chestnut Road in Artane, in the north of the city, at about 05:00 local time on Thursday.
The women were held hostage while the man, a cash in transit employee, was forced to go to work and hand over money.
Up to 200,000 euros (Â£143,000) was reportedly handed over.
A GSLS security van was driven from south Dublin to deliver the cash to a business park at Dublin Airport.
The employee locked himself into the van at the airport before police arrived.
His wife and adult daughter had been tied up and driven around for a number of hours in the back of a van.
They were found in Dunboyne, County Meath and were not physically injured. However, police said they had been left traumatised by their ordeal.
A forensic examination was carried out at the airport before police removed the cash in transit van and another van.
