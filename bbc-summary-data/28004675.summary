Gomis, 28, was out of contract after spending almost five years at the French club, where he scored 56 goals in 120 league appearances.
The forward was a target for the Swans last summer and has now signed a four-year deal.
Newcastle United agreed a fee in the region of Â£8m for the Frenchman in August, but the deal fell through.
Gomis was impressed by the persistence of manager Garry Monk and chairman Huw Jenkins in their continued interest in him.
"They showed they really wanted me - and that's one of the main reasons I chose Swansea ahead of the other interested clubs," said the 12-times capped Frenchman.
"They've been trying for over a year to sign me. It didn't quite happen back then, but they kept trying and I'm absolutely delighted to be here now.
"Although I've been aware of Swansea for a number of seasons, I've been following them a lot closer since the interest first materialised last year.
"It's a proud club with strong philosophies. It is growing all the time and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to be part of it."
Gomis, a product of St Etienne, made his last appearance for Les Bleus in their 3-0 friendly defeat by Brazil in September.
He became Monk's second signing since becoming manager at the Liberty Stadium.
His first was a deal to secure goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski from Arsenal, whose contract with the Gunners expires at the end of June.
