[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The red brick terrace at 9 Newcastle Road, Wavertree, was where the member of The Beatles lived from birth, in 1940, until he was five.
The house has been given a guide price of between Â£150,000 and Â£250,000 ahead of the auction on 29 October.
It has three bedrooms, a rear yard and is a few streets away from Penny Lane, made famous by The Beatles.
The particulars say: "Imagine owning John Lennon's first home".
It is described as "an iconic three-bedroom terrace" in need of some modernisation.
The current owner, who did not want to be named, said: "The main structure of the house and features, such as the original Victorian sliding sash windows, are as they were when John Lennon lived here with his parents and his grandparents from 1940 onwards."
Entwistle Green's regional sales director, Stephen Giddins, said the property had a "unique history".
"To get the opportunity to offer for sale John Lennon's first home is very exciting," he said.
