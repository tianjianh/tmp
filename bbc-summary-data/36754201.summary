Three men have been jailed in connection with the "cowardly" killing of a father-of-six.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeff Henry, 39, was chased and fatally assaulted in Cambridge in June 2015.
Martin Saunders, 35, and Anthony Kenny, 37, admitted manslaughter at the Old Bailey and were jailed for 22 years and 16-and-a-half years respectively.
Ben Maguire, 29, was jailed for four-and-a-half years after admitting conspiracy to commit GBH and assisting an offender.
The attack, the court heard, was the result of a feud between Mr Henry and Saunders, of Beaton Crescent, Huntingdon, over Mr Henry's attempts to get back with his ex- wife.
When Mr Kelly arranged to meet Maguire, of Cambridge, he contacted Saunders and Kenny, of Burgess Walk in St Ives, knowing they wanted to assault him.
After Friday's sentencing Det Insp Al Page said: "This was a cowardly attack."
Mr Henry's sister Suzanne Henry said: "There is no excuse for what they did to Jeff that night and the devastation they have caused, which we have no choice but to live with, and then will have to re-live, when Jeff's youngest children are old enough to understand what happened to their dad, and then we will have to watch them hurting and grieving."
