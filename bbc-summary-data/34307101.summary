A life-sized cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley that stood on rocks at a Dorset beauty spot has toppled over into the water following a storm.

Part of a commission entitled "Land", the sculpture at Clavell Tower, Kimmeridge Bay, was created to mark 50 years of UK building conservation charity Landmark Trust.
At the time Gormley said the artworks were "catalysts for reflection".
The figure was supposed to remain in place until May 2016.
Howard J Curtis, who spotted the statue lying in the bay, said: "I know it wasn't popular with everyone."
The Landmark Trust told the Bournemouth Echo: "We are aware that the "Land" sculpture has come down in the storm at Kimmeridge Bay and we are taking steps to deal with it asap."
Four other statues in the series stand at Lengthsman's Cottage, Lowsonford, in Warwickshire, Lundy Island in the Bristol Channel, Martello Tower, Aldeburgh, in Suffolk, and Saddell Bay, Mull of Kintyre, in Scotland.
