[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denbighshire CCTV operators to be scrapped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
CCTV camera footage from Denbighshire towns will no longer be monitored by operators in a money-saving scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are 59 cameras covering public areas in Rhyl, 18 in Prestatyn and four in Rhuddlan, all linked to a control room in Rhyl police station.
Funding for council staff to monitor camera footage 24 hours a day ends in March, saving Â£200,000 in 2016/17.
Cameras will still run, but footage will not be monitored, and a consultation on job losses has begun.
The plans will be discussed at a Denbighshire council meeting next week and the present service is due to end on 31 October.
