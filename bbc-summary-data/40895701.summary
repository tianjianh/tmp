[SN]TITLE[SN]
Burton Albion 2-1 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lloyd Dyer and Marvin Sordell both scored superb goals as Burton Albion came back to beat Birmingham City and register their first win of 2017-18.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacques Maghoma had put Blues ahead against his former side, stabbing home after Lukas Jutkiewicz's knock down.
Sordell's brilliant turn and 20-yard strike then deservedly made it 1-1 early in the second half.
Dyer's smart finish after Lucas Akins' backheel completed the turnaround to give the Brewers victory.
Nigel Clough's side had been rooted to the bottom of the early Championship table following defeats by Cardiff, Hull and Middlesbrough - but they were good value for their victory against Blues.
The Brewers had looked the more threatening in the early stages and Maghoma, who spent three seasons with Burton, put the visitors in front against the run of play.
But two fine second-half goals - a solo effort from Sordell and an eye-catching team goal finished by Dyer - ensured Albion would continue their 100% record in competitive fixtures against Birmingham.
Blues' biggest threat came from big front men Jutkiewicz and Clayton Donaldson, who came close to altering the course of the match when his overhead kick struck the foot of the post with the score 1-1.
Harry Redknapp's Birmingham have now lost two and won just one of their opening four league fixtures.
Burton manager Nigel Clough:
"It's a big moment in the season for us having lost the first three to get us off the mark.
"A point wouldn't have been a bad result actually for us tonight, but to get all three points and to do it by coming from behind with the way we played at the start of the second half will do us the power of good.
"We managed to get on the front foot more after half-time. We changed formation as well but it wasn't really anything to do with that, it was all down to the application of the players."
Birmingham manager Harry Redknapp:
"We were in a great position to win the game at 1-0 up and with no problems, in control. They came out second half and changed system, went 4-4-2 and we lost it.
"Suddenly four or five of them disappeared and we didn't see them in the second half. We didn't win any battles and in the end it wasn't good enough.
"I need to change a lot of them because they are not good enough for Birmingham City. This is a fantastic football club and if it's the last thing I do in football I will give their fans a good team."
