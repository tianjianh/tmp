Gomez scored 28 goals in 41 games for the Istanbul club, while on loan from Serie A side Fiorentina, and won the Turkish league title.
On Friday, an attempted army coup took place in Turkey with 161 civilians and police killed.
"There are no sporting or any other reasons that have made me make this decision," Gomez, 31, said on Facebook.
Gomez had agreed a season-long loan last year, which included an option to make the deal permanent.
But the former Bayern Munich player has decided to leave following the unrest in the country.
"It was a difficult decision that I had to think about a lot," he said. "I have to tell you Besiktas fans personally that it is very heavy for me that I will not be playing for this great club in front of you wonderful fans in this unique stadium anymore.
"It is purely down to the terrible events that happened in the last few days. I hope you can understand that.
"A huge thanks to the club, to you fans and to all the people with whom my family and I had a lot of wonderful times.
"It was a fantastic year with the championship providing the absolute highlight. I hope that these political problems can be solved in a peaceful manner soon."
Gomez represented Germany at Euro 2016, scoring twice as they went out at the semi-final stage to hosts France.
