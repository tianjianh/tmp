[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to end slum housing conditions in one of Glasgow's most ethnically diverse areas by buying privately-owned flats is to be extended.

Last year Glasgow City Council and the Scottish government committed £11.4m to buy flats in four tenement blocks in Govanhill and help revamp the area.
So far, Govanhill Housing Association has purchased about 100 flats.
The Scottish government has now said it will provide a further £2.5m to enable the purchase of about 40 more flats.
Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said the pilot scheme had been successful and "focussed on tackling the poor condition" of properties in south west Govanhill.
"In partnership with Glasgow City Council and Govanhill Housing Association the pilot has already seen the purchase of 100 properties," he said.
"A substantial repairs programme to the flats is scheduled to start, and I am pleased to hear that work has already been completed to a number of these to bring them up to lettable standard.
"While much remains to be done, Govanhill Housing Association had done great work in the year-and-a-half since this project started and I look forward to this continuing so that we can see real improvements in the area."
The South-West Govanhill Property Acquisition and Repair Programme aims to end overcrowding, poor landlord practice, a lack of factoring arrangements and high tenancy turnover.
The blocks earmarked last year for purchase are located between Calder Street, Allison Street and Dixon Avenue.
The council has already committed £7.1m to the scheme, with a further £4.3m coming from the Scottish government
The council's executive member for communities, Councillor Soryia Siddique, said: "The programme is a vital part in the effort to bring lasting, sustainable change to the way property is managed in Govanhill.
"As more property comes into social housing, we fully believe we can get on top of many of the problems that have affected the area in recent years.
"Alongside the acquisition programme, we have been using all the tools available to us and are now seeing a positive shift in housing standards in Govanhill."
Annie Macfarlane, of Govanhill Housing Association, added: "The original aim...was to purchase around 80 properties over two years and we reached that target after just one year, then passed the milestone of 100 purchases in recent weeks, so it is encouraging that we are successfully taking housing into the social rented sector."
