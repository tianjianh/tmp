Gary Haveron is vying with Colin and Alan Nixon for the vacant manager's post at Glentoran, with the trio to be interviewed on Tuesday night.

Roy Coyle has been in temporary charge at the Oval since Alan Kernaghan's resignation last month.
Haveron won the Championship as Carrick Rangers manager but quit in May despite keeping them in the Premiership.
The Nixon brothers, both former Glens players who are now at H&W Welders, would manager together at the club.
Colin, who made a record 792 appearances for Glentoran, works with the Welders U20 side while Alan is first-team coach.
Former Coleraine and Ballymena United player Haveron left Carrick after a controversial end to last season.
Rangers avoided relegation by finishing 10th but the club was later charged for failing to implement Haveron's touchline ban against Dungannnon.
It could have resulted in Carrick losing three points and being relegated but the Irish FA decided not to apply any sanction following a hearing.
Glentoran have made a poor start to the season and lie 10th in the Premiership standings while Kernaghan stepped sown after a shock League Cup defeat by Annagh United.
