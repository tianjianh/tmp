Hibs had the better of the early chances but Jordan White volleyed in the opener for the visitors.
After Anthony Stokes missed from three yards, he grabbed his sixth goal in Hibs colours this season with a low drive.
Then Martin Boyle thumped a 30-yard screamer into the top corner.
The win allows Hibernian to reduce the gap on second placed Falkirk while Livingston remain in the relegation play-off spot at the bottom.
Hibernian were playing their first home league match since the 3-0 defeat to Morton in late February and the players looked intent in getting back to winning ways with intense early pressure.
John McGinn went on a mazy run and found his way into the 18-yard box, but his shot was brilliantly tipped wide of goal by goalkeeper Marc McCallum.
Jason Cummings was next to try his luck on goal but his shot was just over the crossbar.
The visitors slowly eased their way into the game and shocked the home support when they took the lead midway through the first half.
Osman Kakay, on loan from Queens Park Rangers, had a close range effort blocked by Paul Hanlon, but the rebound fell straight to striker White who sent a stunning volley into the top left hand corner of Mark Oxleys goal.
The 167 away fans that were inside Easter Road were quick to show their team how much they valued the strike.
The goal also led to a chorus of boos ringing around Easter Road as the home fans began to show their frustrations on their teams performance.
Captain David Gray fired just wide when he should have at least tested the keeper, then Liam Henderson and Stokes combined with a set-piece from the training ground, but the on loan Celtic strikers effort was straight at McCallum in the Livi goal.
Another blow came for the home side when El Alagui had to be replaced after suffering a hamstring injury with Jason Keatings his replacement, but Alan Stubbs half-time team talk looked to have ruffled the feathers of his players as the came out of the traps quickly after the break.
They forced four corners in the opening four minutes and it took a goal line clearance from Ben Gordon to deny Stokes an equaliser.
Then an amazing escape for the visitors as Hibs began to pile on the pressure.
Substitute Boyle was only on the pitch for a few minutes when he used his electric pace to take the ball to the bye-line. His cross was met by Stokes on the angle but his glancing effort crept agonisingly along the goal line and was cleared away.
The hosts eventually made the breakthrough when Stokes latched onto a flick by Cummings on the edge of the box and turned before hitting a right foot drive beyond the goalkeeper.
Then Easter Road came to life with with a contender for goal of the season.
The ball fell tantalisingly to Boyle fully 30 yards out and he thundered a shot that was still rising as it hit the roof of the net.
Cummings then had an opportunity to wrap up all three points when sent clear by Keatings, but his effort was straight at McCallum who was able to parry the ball clear.
Hanlon also came close with a header that drifted just wide of goal but the home side were able to see out the game with ease.
