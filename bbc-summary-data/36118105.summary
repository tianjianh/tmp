The loss ended a run of 11 league games unbeaten for Rotherham, who secured Championship safety seven days earlier.
Shane Duffy headed Rovers' winner from Matt Grimes' corner, while Millers keeper Lee Camp denied Danny Graham, Elliott Bennett and Jordi Gomez twice.
Ex-Blackburn striker Leon Best missed the hosts' best chance before half-time, heading wide from close range.
Rovers confirmed Lambert's impending departure on Thursday, with the Scot having only taken charge at Ewood Park in November.
As for Rotherham's managerial situation, Neil Warnock is still to commit his future to the Millers beyond the summer, although chairman Tony Stewart says there is a "strong chance" that the 67-year-old will remain at the club next season.
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock: "I don't think we were prepared. The goal comes and he didn't have to jump for the header. It was a Sunday League goal and I was disappointed in that.
"We lost the game but I can't fault the lads. They have been remarkable but everybody has played their part from the chairman down to the tea lady.
"People have seen magical moments that they will remember for the rest of their lives in this run. We're limited but they have listened to what we've wanted and done their best."
Blackburn manager Paul Lambert: "I thought we deserved to win the game. Lee Camp kept them well in the game but I thought we were brilliant from start to finish.
"We came to play a team who have been playing really well and thought we were outstanding.
"I don't think there is much in the Championship. It doesn't matter if you're on a 20-game winning streak - somebody can come and beat you."
