The arrests were made after 30 officers raided more than 25 addresses across the region on Monday.
Eight men and one woman are being questioned on suspicion of a range of offences, including domestic violence, drug dealing, robbery and assault.
The cash was seized from a property in West Derby, Liverpool.
Ch Insp Chris Gibson, of Merseyside Police, said: "This arrest day was held to locate and detain offenders who are more elusive.
"It has come as a result of lengthy investigations by Merseyside Police and other forces.
"It is extremely pleasing to be able to arrest nine people who we suspect are involved in crime."
