[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Ceredigion surgery serving 4,500 patients which had been under threat of closure has said it will remain open.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ashleigh Surgery in Cardigan received no applications over a seven-month period for a new GP to take over.
The current GPs were due to retire in January 2017, with notice on the practice's contract having been handed to Hywel Dda University Health Board.
But on Wednesday, the surgery posted on its Facebook page that it had withdrawn that resignation.
The surgery said it was "relieved" the health board had accepted that withdrawal after one of the GPs decided stay on beyond retirement, with a long-term locum secured for the "foreseeable future".
"This will ensure we have a period of stability to allow us to continue recruiting and to attract incoming practitioners," the statement said.
The health board has been asked to comment.
In July, 150 concerned patients attended a meeting over the future of the surgery.
