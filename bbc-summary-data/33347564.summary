Heathrow third runway: Living under a flight path in Hounslow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An independent report has recommended a third runway should be built at Heathrow Airport to increase the UK's airport capacity, but what do those living by the airport think?

People in Hounslow West are used to living with noise.
From the Tube trains and buses to the drone of constant traffic along Great Western Road, they are surrounded by noise.
Planes in the sky are just another sound they have become accustomed to tuning out, living and working beneath the flight path of Heathrow Airport, which is about four miles (6km) away.
"Look, if you don't like noise and pollution, don't move to Hounslow West," Terry Ong, manager at MWH Practice said.
"Lots of people living here have at least one or two family members that have some connection to Heathrow, either working there or working for companies that serve it. Many of them moved here for work there, so don't complain then when it expands."
That kind of stoicism and reasoning is why many residents chose to move to the area in the first place.
The residents recognise construction work will cause major disruption in the immediate locality and could worsen the already high level of pollution, but they largely support the development.
Vimal Tadvi, 36, of Strawberry Local newsagent on Great Western Road, said: "Of course this is good. The planes don't bother me, it's not exactly quiet here is it? The traffic is a problem already, but it will bring many, many more jobs. I hope they do it soon."
Lukasz Komor, 27, already depends on Heathrow for his livelihood. He works in the airline catering industry packing cutlery and napkins into boxes and moved to Hounslow West five years ago.
He said: "Yes, it is a good thing. We received a newsletter about this through our door and were very pleased.
"It will create more jobs for people like me. It means I can stay here longer and bring up my son Francis here.
"Yes, I would like to live somewhere greener and prettier but I am close to work and I have everything I need."
Hounslow West has a large mixed population of recently arrived immigrants and British-born second generation immigrants too.
Mr Ong said unemployment was relatively low because of the abundance of skilled and unskilled work provided by the airport.
Chain stores and the main shopping centre can be found down the road in Hounslow, but in Hounslow West independents thrive with a selection of Asian-style supermarkets and Halal butchers.
The western neighbourhood is also more residential, where a one-bed maisonette flat sells for about  Â£200,000.
Vina Rha has lived on Rosemary Road in Hounslow West for 17 years. Planes fly over her house every 10 minutes or so, sometimes more. She said: "I don't hear the planes much anymore, you get used to it.
"The environmental issue is a problem, that's the downside to it I guess. But for me, it's a good thing on balance I think."
Gamel Henin, 52, a former sandwich maker from Feltham, said it would be good for local businesses, but also for tourists and holidaymakers who would be better served by flights. "These people who say there will be more noise, they have to consider other things, other than themselves."
Jobs are the key consideration for Shivraj Grewall, Labour Party branch secretary, who lives near Hounslow West Tube station.
He found out from his MP this morning about the recommendation. He said' "This is going to get through, that's all there is to it.
"People who are living in glass houses, rich people, don't want this, but people want jobs and this will create a lot of jobs.
"People are saying technology has advanced so there won't be as much noise or pollution as there was before."
There is another potential downside though as more jobs could attract more people to the area, which would drive up house rental and sale prices, Ken Shah from Bridge Property Services in Hounslow West High Street said.
"Ok, we're not going to have our homes demolished like the people in Harmondsworth whose village will probably be wiped out by this, but it will make it more expensive for people to move here in future.
"That's good for us, as it means more commission, but there is already a housing shortage here.  It means rents and sale prices will rise unless the government builds more houses here," he said.
His solution is for the council to allow people to build studio flats on the back of their homes.
Mr Shah added: "If we don't find a cheap housing solution the jobs are going to be taken up by people from outside the area who will have to travel in from a long way and who won't be contributing to the local economy."
Government ministers are split about the runway decision and people are bracing themselves for a long wait before they see any development.
John Hallissey, 53, from Hayes has lived around the area his whole life and said: "The thing is they have a job on their hands to get HS2 through first, there's been a big hoo ha. This will be another fight."
