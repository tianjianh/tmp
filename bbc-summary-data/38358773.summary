Two fine goals from Ethan Rafferty and a Conor White strike proved enough for Kieran McGeeney's side to triumph.
The Orchard men held out to claim the trophy despite having White and Aidan Forker sent-off in the second half.
Armagh led 2-5 to 0-7 at the break and their third goal 90 seconds into the second half gave them a vital cushion when their numbers were reduced.
Each time the Red Hands went level, the Orchard men hit them with a goal.
Harry Loughran had just tied it up at 0-3 each when White collected Oisin MacIomhair's pass to fire a low, angled shot past Mickey O'Neill.
And in the 36th minute, moments after Cathal McShane's point had made it 1-4 to 0-7, Rafferty set the game alight with a brilliant strike, smashed into the net from 12 yards from Rory Grugan's assist.
The Tyrone defence was caught cold after losing a kick-out, and Rafferty raced through to slot a low shot to the net for his second.
Points from Oisin MacIomhair and Anthony Duffy opened up a massive nine points gap, before White and Forker were both sent off on second bookings.
Tyrone fought back with scores from Declan McClure, Ronan O'Neill and Lee Brennan, but they had too much to do, and Armagh claimed the trophy with six points to spare.
