Autumn international: Ireland 52-21 Canada

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland's second string eased to a comfortable eight-try victory over a determined Canada at the Aviva Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
With 15 changes from the win over New Zealand, the Irish led 14-0 after tries by Keith Earls and Luke Marshall.
Tries from DTH van der Merwe and Taylor Paris levelled but Tiernan O'Halloran gave Ireland a 21-14 half-time lead.
A penalty try, Ultan Dillane, Kieran Marmoin, O'Halloran and debutant James Tracy added to Ireland's tally while Matt Evans got Canada's third try.
Paddy Jackson landed all of his six conversion attempts for the hosts with scrum-half Gordon McRorie kicking three out of three for the visitors.
Ireland now face a rematch with the All Blacks who will be hungry to avenge that 40-29 defeat by Joe Schmidt's men in Chicago.
Ireland's fringe players were given the opportunity to impress, and several seized their chance to give head coach Joe Schmidt plenty to mull over ahead of the All Blacks rematch.
Eight players made their debut, five off the bench, and did enough to suggest the future looks bright for Irish rugby.
But it was the experienced players like Cian Healy, Sean O'Brien, Peter O'Mahony, Paddy Jackson and Keith Earls who were under most pressure to prove a point and, for the most part, they delivered.
O'Brien was one of the big success stories of the evening.
The Leinster flanker had been building up his match fitness in recent weeks and displayed all the dynamism of old in the loose, making 13 carries to press home his claims for a place on the bench next week.

Coach Schmidt has often been criticised for not giving youth its chance but handed out eight new caps, taking the total of players who have made their debuts this year to 18.
Garry Ringrose's rise to the international ranks did not come quick enough for some, but the Leinster centre enhanced his reputation with a couple of line breaks and was unlucky not to get on the scoresheet.
Jack O'Donoghue's composure in the back row, in between the vastly experienced O'Brien and O'Mahony, suggested he has a lot to offer at this level.
Apart from the rookies, a trio of Connacht players whose international careers are still in their infancy excelled on an encouraging evening for Ireland.
Tight-head Finlay Bealham transferred his off-loading game to the international stage and Ultan Dillane, who is highly-rated by Schmidt, showed ambition and adventure.
After making his debut on the summer tour of South Africa, full-back O'Halloran picked some fantastic lines and did his chances of another appearance during the autumn series no harm with two well-taken tries.
