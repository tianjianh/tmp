The 65-year-old victim, who has not yet been formally identified, was discovered at a property in Cottage Walk on Tuesday afternoon.
His death was originally treated as unexplained and officers have said he may have died up to four weeks ago.
A post-mortem examination on Friday afternoon revealed he died from stab wounds.
Officers were called to the address after a member of the public raised concerns about the man's welfare, West Midlands Police said.
Det Insp Ian Iliffe said the victim was known to be alive on 5 May and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
"It is possible that he may have been dead for up to four weeks but we are currently in the process of establishing the circumstances," he said.
