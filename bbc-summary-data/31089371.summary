Katy Perry used a giant tiger, Lenny Kravitz and backing dancers dressed as sharks to wow the crowds with her Super Bowl half-time performance.

The US singer rattled through a medley of hits during a 12-minute concert that also included a guest appearance from rapper Missy Elliott.
It ended with Perry singing Firework as actual pyrotechnics exploded above her.
According to The Guardian, the result was a "high-octane show [as] notable for its surreal camp as for its tunes".
The New York Times said she "held her own, navigating a handful of her smashes and three wardrobe changes in a performance that resisted bad mood".
"Even if you weren't a fan of Perry's music, you had to be impressed with her spectacle," agreed USA Today.
Britney Spears, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg were among the celebrities on hand to watch the New England Patriots narrowly beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24.
Earlier, Frozen star Idina Menzel kicked off proceedings at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale, Arizona with the traditional rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner.
Perry followed such other high-profile half-time performers as Madonna, Beyonce and last year's interval act, Bruno Mars.
The 30-year-old avoided the controversy that dogged such previous performers as Janet Jackson, whose infamous "wardrobe malfunction" made headlines around the world in 2004.
The California Gurls singer marked the occasion by having XLIX - the Roman numerals for 49, marking the 49th Super Bowl - tattooed on one of the fingers of her right hand.
"I thought it would be appropriate to draw blood tonight," tweeted the singer, who also sang excerpts from I Kissed a Girl and Teenage Dream during her set.
Viewers in the US were also treated to new trailers for Jurassic World, Pitch Perfect 2 and other upcoming films during the ad breaks that punctuated the American Football action.
Other highlights included actor Bryan Cranston reviving his Walter White character from Breaking Bad for a car insurance commercial.
