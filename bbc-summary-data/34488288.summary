Truro City boss Steve Tully says a 'crazy' five-minute spell cost his side their place in the FA Cup.

City lost 4-1 at Margate in the third qualifying round, failing to hold on to an early lead given them by Craig Duff.
Margate scored twice at the end of the first half and hit two more after the break to complete the comeback win.
"The plan worked effectively, we scored an early goal and for 40 minutes in the first half we just needed a second goal to kill the game," Tully said.
"You could see they were a team lacking confidence, but we had a five-minute crazy spell just before half-time, we gave them one soft goal, but to give them two, just before half-time, changed the whole complex of the game, " Tully added to BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I'm disappointed for the lads because they put in a lot of effort and we've travelled a lot of miles in the last few days to get here, but we'll dust ourselves off and make sure we're ready to go next weekend.
"We're still undefeated in six games in the league and we'll want to continue that next weekend at Whitehawk.
"We'll make sure all the good things we've been doing over the past five or six weeks don't go out of the window."
