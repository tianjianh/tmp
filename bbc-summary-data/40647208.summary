The 25-year-old was a free agent, having been released by Blackburn Rovers when his contract expired earlier this summer.
He began his career at Everton and has also played for Crawley and Reading, and had a spell on loan at Hull City.
"The fans can expect me to be energetic in midfield. I like to tackle and hopefully I can also score a few goals," he told Burton's website.
