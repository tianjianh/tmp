Why is this street food a great social leveller?

That jhalmuri is delicious is something that all Bengalis can agree on.

Buy a packet of the stuff from one of the many jhalmuri stalls in Kolkata's (Calcutta) famous Maidan - the vast park in the centre of this magnificent city - and just watch the customers as you eat.
You will see suited businessmen step out of sleek limousines to join the queue alongside the city's poorest residents.
The great leveller indeed!
