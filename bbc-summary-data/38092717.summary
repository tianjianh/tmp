No prosecution over death of Keane Wallis-Bennett in wall collapse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
No criminal proceedings will be brought over the death of a high school pupil who was killed when a wall collapsed onto her, prosecutors have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keane Wallis-Bennett, 12, died at Edinburgh's Liberton High School in April 2014 when a changing room wall in a gym collapsed.
The Crown Office said the decision not to prosecute "may be reconsidered" if further evidence came to light.
A fatal accident inquiry will now be held into Keane's death.
No-one else was injured in the incident, which involved a freestanding "modesty wall" in the changing room.
Keane's death was investigated by the Health and Safety Executive and Police Scotland.
Liberton High School, which has about 650 pupils, was built in 1959, and the PE accommodation was refurbished in the mid-1980s.
The gym hall where Keane died has since been demolished, with Â£2.5m spent on new facilities.
A statement from the Crown Office said: "After giving the case careful consideration, Crown Counsel have concluded, based on the available evidence, that there will be no criminal proceedings brought as a result of the death. Should additional evidence come to light that decision may be reconsidered.
"Crown Counsel have decided that it is in the public interest to hold a fatal accident inquiry to examine the full circumstances surrounding this tragic death to help avoid such an incident happening again in the future.
"The fatal accident inquiry will have an opportunity to consider the safety of internal freestanding walls."
A date has not yet been set for the inquiry.
