[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The union which represents striking contract staff at An Post in the Republic of Ireland has said it has agreed to suspend industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thirty-six staff who maintain sorting equipment at four An Post centres have been on strike in a row over pay cuts since Friday.
The staff are employed by contractor IO Systems, but are retained by An Post to work at its sorting centres.
The Communications Workers' Union (CWU) said talks would resume on Tuesday.
The action by IO Systems staff had caused disruption to services in the Republic of Ireland and had led An Post to issue an appeal to people not to mail letters or parcels.
CWU said the IO Systems workers were in dispute "in response to the unilateral imposition of rostering arrangements that cut their wages by 22%".
IO Systems managing director Fergal Lynam said the dispute had been ongoing for more than two years.
He told Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ that contract changes were needed as weekend working was no longer required in the mailing centres and because of decreasing volumes at An Post.
In a statement on Monday, CWU said it had agreed to suspend industrial action at the request of mediator Phil Flynn and after confirmation from IO Systems that its workers would be reinstated in their jobs at their agreed wage levels and rostering arrangements.
"The union understands that talks are being arranged through Phil Flynn involving IO Systems for tomorrow (Tuesday) afternoon," the statement said.
"The union said it expects An Post management to immediately restore full service across the National Postal System."
CWU general secretary, Steve Fitzpatrick said said the union was prepared to engage but only on the basis that workers at IO Systems had their jobs restored to their agreed wage levels and rosters.
"We are also prepared to back Phil Flynn's intervention in good faith," he said.
"However, we hope that IO Systems, or indeed An Post management, don't squander the opportunity that is being presented."
