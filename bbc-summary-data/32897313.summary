Parliamentarians in Madagascar have voted to impeach President Hery Rajaonarimampianina.

The constitutional court will now decide whether he has violated the constitution and can be dismissed.
The BBC's Martin Vogl in the capital, Antananarivo, says the late night vote came as a surprise to many.
Mr Rajaonarimampianina has been in office for 16 months and it was hoped his election would end years of political unrest on the island nation.
Madagascar suffered five years of political turmoil beginning in 2009 when Andry Rajoelina ousted Marc Ravalomanana from power.
The coup left the country isolated in the international community and deprived of foreign aid.
Ahead of the parliamentary vote, the US embassy in Antananarivo urged the MPs to put the stability of the country first.
