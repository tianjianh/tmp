Motorists saw the vehicle "tootling along" the A601 in Derby on 2 March, with one capturing the scene on a dashcam.
Officers said they had traced the owner to the Chaddesden area.
The man, who had a stroke some years ago, also offered his apologies to other road users, police said.
PC Mark Atterbury from the Chaddesden Safer Neighbourhood Team said: "Unfortunately he had been given some incorrect information about where and when he could use it that caused him to be on a road that was very unsafe for a vehicle of that type.
"Thankfully with the information we received I have been able to pay him a visit and give him the correct advice that means he will now be able to use his scooter in a safer fashion.
"He wanted me to apologise to any of the other road users who had been concerned about his actions but is now pleased to have had the correct information."
