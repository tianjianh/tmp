Speaking to delegates gathered in Perth, the MSP insisted: "The Labour Party I lead will never betray its values so easily.
"It will never turn its back on the idea that together weâ€™re stronger.
"That we can achieve far more working in partnership than we can alone."
Ms Dugdale went on to say in her keynote speech: "Conference, the Labour Party I lead will never support independence."
