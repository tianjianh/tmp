GB's Abbie Brown opened the scoring after just 15 seconds before Fiji's Litia Naiqato finished off a stunning team move to level.
But Alice Richardson and Joanne Watmore gave Team GB a 19-7 half-time lead, and Brown sealed the win with her second.
Australia and Canada will play in the second semi-final on Monday.
Great Britain earlier beat a strong Canada side 22-0 in their final group game.

And Brown said that Sunday's improvement came because the team had "settled" after feeling nerves on the first day.
"It is an Olympics, the nerves are going to hit," she said.
"We have shown everyone today with Canada and Fiji, we have done ourselves justice."
Britain's semi-final will get underway at 19:00 BST on Monday, with the final following at 23:00.
