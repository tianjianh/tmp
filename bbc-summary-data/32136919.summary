[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barry Crossan, from Creggan Heights, had denied involvement in the armed robbery at Ladbrokes on the Racecourse Road back in December 2013.
However, Crossan was convicted last month by a jury of stealing almost Â£400 in the raid.
The 38-year-old was also found guilty of possessing a firearm or imitation firearm.
The court was told that Crossan was armed and wearing a black balaclava during the robbery.
He shouted at the male staff member behind the counter "give me the money".
A judge said: "Offending such as this against small businesses must be deterred."
Crossan will serve five years of the sentence in custody and five years on licence in the community.
