A sex attacker who raped a woman after her first night out clubbing in Scotland has been jailed for five years.

The victim moved to England shortly after she was subjected to the ordeal at a flat in Edinburgh.
Mike Okah, 26, had earlier denied assaulting and raping the woman at the flat in Telford Grove on 19 July 2014, but was found guilty by a jury.
He was placed on the sex offenders' register.
A judge told Okah: "You subjected a woman who you had only just met to a terrifying attack."
Lady Wise told Okah, a Nigerian who was in the country on a visitor's visa, he would be deported to his African homeland after he served his sentence.
Police who saw the Latvian woman after she was subjected to the sex attack by Okah said she appeared upset and having trouble walking. One officer said: "She was holding her groin."
The woman had arrived in Scotland for a visit but got work at a bakery and found accommodation in Bathgate, West Lothian.
Acquaintances had encouraged her to go clubbing in the capital but first they had called at a flat where Okah was staying in the city's Telford Grove.
The woman was asked at the High Court in Edinburgh whether there was anything such as kissing and cuddling between her and Okah before the group went out.
She said: "Absolutely nothing at all. We actually didn't talk."
After they returned from the disco the plan was she and the others would stay over at the flat and the 28-year-old intended to sleep on a mattress in the living room fully clothed.
She said Okah came into the room and attacked her.
The woman told the court: "I felt terrible. It was very painful."
Defence solicitor advocate Leanne McQuillan said Okah continued to deny involvement in the offence. She added he had no previous convictions in the UK.
Det Ch Insp Alwyn Bell, of Police Scotland, said: "I would like to acknowledge the courage of the victim throughout this investigation.
"This was a particularly violent incident and Okah refused to acknowledge his guilt, going to great lengths to attempt to cover up his crime.
"Tackling sexual crime is a priority for Police Scotland.
"We continue to encourage anyone subjected to any crime of a sexual nature to contact Police Scotland."
