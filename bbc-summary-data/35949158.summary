"We played very well first half and we started the second half alright. We made three massive errors.
"I don't think they won it. I actually think we lost it.
"Everything about what we were doing was fine. You've got to play with your head."
Portsmouth manager Paul Cook told BBC Radio Solent:

"I think the most important thing to speak about is the end result. It was a great performance today by the lads in general.
"We've got to keep going, we've got to keep believing in what we're doing. It's important we believe in the run we're putting together now.
"I don't think this team's character will ever be in question; the consistency, yeah.
"We're on 69 points. There's a lot of points for us to play for and, as I say, it's a benchmark for where we want to go in the future."
