[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sanjay Salhorta, 26, of Clarence Street, Southall, was found guilty of murdering Harinder Ratten near his home on 4 January.
Police said Salhorta killed the 41-year-old after he previously attacked him in his car, only for Mr Ratten to hit him with a crowbar in retaliation.
He was sentenced at the Old Bailey to serve a minimum of 26-and-a-half years.
During the first attack on 20 December 2014, Harinder Ratten had been sitting in his car when a man in a hooded top opened the door, struck him in the face and demanded he get out of the vehicle.
Mr Ratten retaliated by hitting the attacker with a crowbar until the attacker fled.
Tests done on the crowbar after the 41-year-old's death found blood on it belonged to Salhorta.
In January, Mr Ratten was found lying in the road with multiple stab wounds.
After the stabbing, Salhorta hid in a nearby alleyway where he dropped the murder weapon. This was found by the police with Mr Ratten's DNA upon it.
Salhorta then went to the house of a friend, Inderjit Bhachu, who also lived in Clarence Street.
He changed clothes in the house before the pair drove to Staines where they burnt Salhorta's clothing.
Bhachu, 28, also of Clarence Street, was sentenced to four years in prison after previously pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice.
He was cleared of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm with intent.
Det Ch Insp Simon Aswin of the Metropolitan Police said it was "a brutal attack for nothing other than for Sanjay Salhotra to save face".
"I am pleased that Salhotra and Bachu now face a considerable prison sentences," he said.
