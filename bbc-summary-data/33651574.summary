His car flipped and came to rest upside down after hitting the wall following a spin out of the Hungaroring's Turn 11, caused by a rear suspension failure.
Perez climbed out of the car and told his team he was unhurt.
Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton ended the session fastest after a very impressive 90 minutes, 0.109secs ahead of team-mate Nico Rosberg in second.
Perez's car was pitched into a spin when the right-rear suspension broke as he ran wide, and flipped when a front wheel was caught under the chassis.
The initial spin sent the car spinning across the track into the inside wall, after which it continued to spin and then turned over.
Perez conducted media interviews minutes after the crash following his return to the paddock.
"Thanks to God, everything is OK," Perez said.
"I lost the rest and went into the wall. On the Astroturf, it is very slippery. The car is quite badly damaged but hopefully we can recover and do a bit of second practice. I hope we can recover from this."

The incident was a reminder of the ever-present dangers involved in F1, just three days after the funeral of Jules Bianchi, who died last week from injuries sustained in a crash in last October's Japanese Grand Prix.
The teams and drivers are all carrying tributes to the Frenchman on their cars and helmets at this weekend's race.
On track, world champion Hamilton was two seconds clear of the field after the first 20 minutes, as he reached the limits faster than his rivals.
At the end of the session, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was third, 0.671secs slower than Hamilton and 0.241secs ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo in fifth.
The second Red Bull of Daniil Kvyat was sixth, ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.
Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz, Perez, Williams's Valtteri Bottas and Toro Rosso's Max Verstappen completed the top 10, ahead of the McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button.
Raikkonen's session ended a few minutes early when the front wing dropped off his car coming out of Turn 12, leaving debris on the track and puncturing the Ferrari's front tyre.
Some teams did sneak out for an extra couple of laps when the green light came on again with less than a minute to go.
Lotus did very limited mileage after solving a financial dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli shortly before the session, Pastor Maldonado ending up 17th and reserve driver Jolyon Palmer 20th after not setting a time.
At Manor, reserve driver Fabio Leimer had his first outing on a grand prix weekend and was 19th, about a second slower than team-mate and regular race driver Will Stevens.
