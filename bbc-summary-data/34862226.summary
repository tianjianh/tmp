Edinburgh trams: Councillors to vote on extension to Newhaven

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to extend the tram line in Edinburgh are expected to be approved in principle later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City councillors will consider a report which recommends the track should be run through Leith to Newhaven.
Leith was part of the original tram route but after the project hit problems the tracks got no further than York Place in the city centre.
Now councillors are voting on recommendations to extend services north into Leith and onto Newhaven.
Officials said this would bring benefits to Edinburgh's most densely populated area with the fewest car owners.
It is estimated the three mile extension would cost £144.7m to build.
If the proposals are agreed in principle, a nine-month period of development will begin, including site investigation and procurement.
Once that is complete, a report will be brought back to the council recommending the way forward.
Edinburgh's tram service began running in May 2014, but only after six years of disruption and a bitter dispute between the city council and its contractor.
The previous Labour-led Scottish government originally earmarked £375m to pay for the tram network, which ended up costing £776m and began running years late.
