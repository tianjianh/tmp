In 2014, there were 21,600 people visiting the island, dropping from 28,550 the previous year, VisitGuernsey figures show.
The number of business visitors staying more than one night was also down, from 40,450 in 2013 to 36,000 in 2014.
Leisure day visitors to the island were up by 36% from 29,450 through 2013 to 40,050 in 2014.
But Mike Hopkins, director of marketing at VisitGuernsey, said he was delighted with the performance in a challenging climate.
He: "It remains a challenging and increasingly competitive climate and to achieve steady growth during the year after a tough 2013, is a huge achievement and testament to the tourism industry."
The overall number of people staying in the island went up by 1.3% from 227,800 to 230,700 with a 2.2% increase in bed nights.
Guernsey's Chamber of Commerce wanted time to examine the figures before commenting.
