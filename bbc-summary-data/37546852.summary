The 19th Century property in Terrington St Clement, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, previously served as a military club during the two World Wars.
Its current owner, and avid skateboarder, Rob Marsden, 41, said the skate ramps "just took over the room".
The three-bedroom property is for sale with a guide price of Â£200,000.

Estate agent Kate Mamo, from Attik Property Services, said: "We're getting interest from all over the world, and 80% of that is from people who want to keep it as it is which is great.
"It's great for Rob as he has built it with a lot of love."
Mr Marsden, who restores Range Rovers, bought the property 13 years ago.
It took him six months to build the 8m (26ft) by 12m (39ft) wooden skate bowl.
"I do a lot of wakeboarding and snowboarding so I built myself a ramp," he said.
"I then built a bigger one and a bigger one - before I knew it, it just took over the room.
"It's good fun. I have bowl nights every Wednesday night with my friends."
He said he had decided to sell up to move somewhere where he could accommodate both himself and his business.
"I'll miss my bowl nights but I have no intention of hanging up my board just yet," he said.
