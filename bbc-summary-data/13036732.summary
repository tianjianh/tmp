President: Jose Eduardo dos Santos
Jose Eduardo dos Santos, of the ruling MPLA, has been in power since 1979, and is Africa's second-longest serving head of state after Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang. He keeps tight control over all aspects of Angola's political life.
Many Angolans credit the president for leading the country to recovery after the end of its 27-year civil war in 2002, and for turning the country's formerly socialist economy into one of the world's fastest-growing - mainly on the back of Angola's prodigious oil wealth.
Some, however, accuse him of authoritarianism, staying in office for too long and failing to distribute the proceeds from the oil boom more widely.
In 2008, his party won the country's first parliamentary elections for 16 years. A new constitution approved in 2010 substituted direct election of the president with a system under which the top candidate of the largest party in parliament becomes president.
It also strengthened the presidency's powers, prompting the Unita opposition to accuse the government of "destroying democracy".
He appointed his daughter Isabel as chief executive of the state-run oil firm Sonangol in 2016, prompting suspicions that he is establishing a dynasty at a time he is winding down his own career.
Isabel has been ranked by Forbes magazine as the richest woman on the continent with a fortune of around $3 billion.
Social media appeared to be under threat at the end of 2015 when President dos Santos called for their stricter regulation, at a time when the government was cracking down on political dissident and activism.
For many urban Angolans, the internet has become the primary medium for expression of political anger because of the dangers of protesting on the streets.
The state controls all media with nationwide reach, including radio, the most influential medium outside the capital.
