Another Italian, Danilo Petrucci, was third on his Ducati.
Yamaha's Valentino Rossi, who suffered a motocross training accident last month, finished fourth having led.
Three-time world champion Jorge Lorenzo also led in the opening laps before the Spaniard dropped off the pace as Dovizioso, Vinales and Petrucci took up the challenge.

However, Dovizioso held off the Spaniard to become the fourth different winner in six races this season.
