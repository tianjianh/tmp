[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nasa's Kepler telescope has found a world that shares many characteristics with Earth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Here are some of your alternative offerings to its given name, Kepler-452b.
Billy Buroo tweets: "Name it after whoever was on duty at time of discovery #planetbob #planetsandra #planetoftheapes"
IDON suggests: "yeah, I think Terraduo sounds better which is just "Earth 2" in Latin!!"
Margaret Newson has a selection: "Skaro; unless the Daleks got there first .., Mondas or Gallifrey?"
And on our Facebook page we have received a number of suggestions:
Scott McMillan says Kemba. Alfred Lynch reckons Democracy.
Rene Rios wants Puria as a name. Russel Mantosh says Hodor and Sean Oliver says Hope.
Joshua C Duplantis asks for Krypton or Planet Vegeta.
