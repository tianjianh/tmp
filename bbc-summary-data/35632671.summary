The prisoner was returning from exercise at HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton when he threatened the officer, HM Prison Service said.
He was ordered back to his cell but as he returned, he attacked the officer causing him to fall onto railings and "take a blow to the head".
He was taken to hospital with suspected broken ribs and a black eye. G4S, which runs the jail, said he is now at home.

The prisoner was restrained and put in segregation pending adjudication, HM Prison Service said.
Staffordshire Police was also informed following the incident last Thursday.
HMP Oakwood is managed privately by G4S and opened in 2012.
It is one of the largest prisons in England and Wales, providing places for up to 1,605 Category C male prisoners.
In a statement, John McLaughlin, director of the jail, said: "A prisoner attacked a member of our team last week and we have already stripped them of their privileges and we are looking at other possible sanctions, including additional days added to their sentence.
"There is no place for violence or aggression at Oakwood."
