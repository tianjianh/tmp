The 35-year-old former Blackpool and Huddersfield player initially joined on non-contract terms on 3 October.
He scored on his debut and has since made one substitute appearance.
"That gives us both a chance to have a longer look at each other. It puts me in the shop window so if I do well, I get an extension here or I get a move to another club," Taylor-Fletcher said.
Accrington also confirmed striker Max Hazeldine, 19, has left the club by mutual consent.
