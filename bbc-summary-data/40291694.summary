'Heterosexual friendly' B&B alters website after court threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Highlands bed and breakfast which was described as "heterosexual friendly" on its website has removed phrases after being threatened with legal action.

Owner Tom Forrest also featured the phrase "man + woman = marriage" on the site for Cromasaig B&B in Kinlochewe.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in Scotland had begun action to seek a court order.
However, it said this had been halted after Mr Forrest agreed to remove the phrases voluntarily.
The website said the guest house was "heterosexual friendly" and included a pictorial version of the statement "man + woman = marriage".
The commission said it was concerned that these phrases were potentially discriminatory.
It initially wrote to Mr Forrest asking for them to be removed after receiving complaints.
When no action was taken, the commission sought a court order which would require the phrases to be removed.
That legal action has been halted after the statements were deleted voluntarily.
Lynn Welsh, of the EHRC, said: "I am pleased that the owners of Cromasaig B&B have agreed to remove these phrases.
"Removing the phrases will have no negative impact on their business, and alleviates EHRC's concerns."
EHRC added that while the case had been "concluded successfully", the case raised questions surrounding the "continued prevalence of homophobic discrimination" which exists in Scotland.
Owner Mr Forrest sparked controversy in 2004 when he refused a gay couple a double room at the guest house.
The couple, from London, were told they could only book a twin room because their relationship was "unnatural".
As a result, the B&B had its recommended status removed by tourist authority VisitScotland.
