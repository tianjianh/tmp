The Silent Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It may be more than 70 years since the end of World War Two and the liberation of the concentration camps, but photographers are still drawn to explore the physical remains of the sites where the Holocaust took place.

Alex Boyd's pictures of the forests around Bergen-Belsen camp are being shown at the Scottish Parliament.
Boyd was born in the nearby town of Celle, to a German mother and Scottish father, but his connection runs even deeper, as his grandfather Robert was part of the Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh's), which administered the camp after liberation.
More recently, Alex's brother Benjamin also worked at the camp, in the German army, clearing fallen trees and protecting the memorial from damage.
"Forests have often fascinated and terrified me," says Boyd.  "They are an integral part of the German imagination - from the battles of the Teutoburg Forest, the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, to the many Goethe's Oaks which can be found across the country, where the poet is said to have walked or composed."
Boyd says the pictures of the bodies piled high from the time of liberation by the British Army in 1945 will never lose the ability to shock the viewer.
"It is something which is hard to reconcile with the sight of the camp today, which due to the burning down of the barracks to stop the spread of typhus in 1945 retains a somewhat rural feel, with large empty fields ringed in by the mass graves of thousands," Boyd says.
"The site of so much suffering is ringed in by a forest of birch and pine, silently observing the scene. I often thought of the prisoners looking out from within the camp to the forest beyond, and what they were thinking.
"No matter how many times I walk the landscapes of Bergen-Belsen, or Auschwitz I will never be able to understand what happened in those places."
Boyd's pictures were taken over a ten year period with a camera that once belonged to German-born British photographer Fay Godwin and printed on gampi, a fragile hand-made paper from Japan.
"I print on gampi for several reasons, key among these is the fragile nature of the material. It has a unique texture, a softness and tactility, and gives the images an ephemeral feel," says Boyd.
"The prints as a result have a slightly unreal quality to them, something which one definitely feels when visiting Belsen. It is a quiet place, many visitors remarking that birds do not sing there."
This process was learnt from the Japanese photographer and master printer Takeshi Shikama when Boyd worked with him at Sabhal Mor Ostaig on the Isle of Skye in 2012.
Boyd says: "Takeshi did not speak much English, but we did share something greater, a love and fascination of the Scottish landscape. Together we worked, often in silence, climbing into the hills of the Cuillin, or the Trotternish ridge in the north of the Island.
"Often images would not be taken, but the scene quietly observed. I think that is an important lesson to learn as a photographer.
"Often working late into the night, we would print using platinum, reflect, and often start again, aiming not always for perfection in the prints, but for a clarity of vision.
"Printing images on to gampi, a fragile hand-made paper from Japan, proved very difficult and often frustrating, however I am slowly learning to be more patient."
