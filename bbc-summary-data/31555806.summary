[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been sentenced to 15 years in prison after being found guilty of attempting to murder his wife as she worked in an intensive care unit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A bare-chested Royston Jones attacked nurse Claire Jones at Nevill Hall Hospital, Abergavenny, in September.
Jones, 39, of Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, was heard shouting "kill" and "die" and left his estranged wife unconscious.
During his trial Jones was described as jealous, aggressive, and certain Ms Jones was in a new relationship.
The court heard had it not been for the intervention of staff he would have undoubtedly succeeded in killing her.
After the attack, Ms Jones was treated at the hospital's accident and emergency unit for a swollen neck, throat and back injuries.
She told the trial "he was like a man possessed. I was aware of colleagues screaming and I lost consciousness.
"The next thing I remember is being dragged in to an office and a colleague telling me 'You're alright now'".
Jones was found guilty of attempted murder following a trial at Newport Crown Court earlier this month.
Sentencing Jones, Judge Eleri Rees, commended staff at the hospital for their actions, in particular anaesthetist Edward Curtis.
"Dr Curtis showed enormous courage in going to the rescue of Claire Jones who was being strangled," said the Recorder of Cardiff.
"He did so at considerable risk to himself and in doing so he too was assaulted and sustained injury. If Dr Curtis had not intervened in the way he did Claire Jones may well have died."
