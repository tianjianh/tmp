Northern Ireland will mark Armistice Day by wearing plain black armbands in the World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irish FA requested permission from Fifa for Northern Ireland to wear a poppy on the shirt or armband.
However, Fifa could not guarantee that there would not be disciplinary proceedings if a poppy was displayed.
England and Scotland will defy Fifa's ban on players wearing poppies in their meeting on Friday.
Fifa has also opened disciplinary proceedings over the Republic of Ireland's use of a logo to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising.
There will be a minute's silence before kick-off at Windsor Park on Friday while names of players connected with the association who died during the First World War will be shown on the big screen.
Commemorative events also include a card display featuring a poppy in the West Stand and a wreath will be laid in memory of the fallen.
IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson said it wants clarification over the Fifa law relating to displaying poppies.
"The Irish FA is committed to marking Armistice Day with appropriate acts of remembrance," said IFA chief executive Patrick Nelson.
"We asked Fifa if permission could be granted for the Northern Ireland team to wear a poppy on the shirt or on an armband.
"Based on law 4.4 of the laws of the game 2016/17, Fifa advised that they could give no guarantee that there would not be disciplinary proceedings if the Northern Ireland team was to wear a symbol of remembrance on the playing shirt.
"As a member of IFAB, we have placed clarification of law 4.4 on the agenda for the next annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board which will be held in London in March."
