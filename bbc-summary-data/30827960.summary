Two primary schools in Shropshire which closed due to snow have now reopened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brown Clee in Ditton Priors and Clunbury closed on Wednesday, Shropshire Council announced.
However, both schools said they had now reopened and pupils had returned to class.
The Met Office has a yellow weather warning in place for Shropshire. It predicted more wintry showers later, which may be heavy at times, with a risk of hail and thunder.
The council said: "As far as we know, all schools are back open today after the snow yesterday."
