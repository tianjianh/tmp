Having restricted the Netherlands to a modest 90-6 from their 20 overs, the Irish reached their victory target with more than eight overs to spare.
Openers Cecelia Joyce (39) and Clare Shillington (33) added 74 for the first wicket in the opening eight overs.
Earlier, Dutch wicketkeeper Miranda Veringmeier made 53 but lacked support.
Joyce's twin sister Isobel, the Irish captain, was their most successful bowler, taking 3-18 after conceding 10 runs in her opening over.
Ciara Metcalfe took 2-19 and Kim Garth 1-14 while 16-year-old seamer Lucy O'Reilly, although wicketless, conceded only eight runs from her four overs.
Ireland play China in their second Group B match on Sunday, and then face Zimbabwe on Tuesday.
In Saturday's other Group B game, Zimbabwe beat China by 10 wickets, while in Group A, Scotland and Bangladesh saw off Papua New Guinea and hosts Thailand respectively.
The top two teams in the eight-strong qualifying tournament will progress to next year's Women's World T20 in India.
