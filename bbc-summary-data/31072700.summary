Forecasters said southwest Scotland, the Borders, Lothian, Fife, central Scotland, Tayside, the northeast and the Highlands could be affected.
They forecast that snow could lie even at lower levels.
Northerly winds gusting 60-70 mph will give rise to drifting snow and blizzard conditions.
The Met Office yellow warning said: "Conditions will improve slowly overnight, but further snow showers are likely, even on low ground.
"Icy patches are likely throughout the warning area.
"The public should be aware of the risk of disruption due to snow and ice."
