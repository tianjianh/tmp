Several thousand fans walked out on Saturday before Liverpool threw away a 2-0 lead to draw 2-2 with Sunderland.
A supporters' group had urged fans to leave their seats in the 77th minute in protest at the £77 top-priced ticket in the new main stand next season.
"It's not what we want," said Klopp, who missed the game with appendicitis.
"What I know is everyone in the club has a big interest in finding a solution.
"We don't want people to leave the stadium before the game is finished."
The club have since cancelled a live question and answer session about the controversial 2016-17 pricing structure.
Chief executive Ian Ayre was due to answer queries sent in by fans on the club's television station at 18:00 GMT on Monday.
However, the event was cancelled by the club just over fours hours beforehand.
"LFC thanks fans for submitting questions for tonight's Q&A. However, due to ongoing ticketing discussions, this will no longer take place," said a statement on the club's Twitter account.

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was one of those to join in with the protest on Saturday.
Writing in his column for the Daily Mail, he insisted "£77 is too much to watch a game anywhere" but said that price is "particularly over the top in Liverpool".
Carragher added that the walkout was staged with supporters of all clubs in mind.
He added: "That's what people need to understand about the walkout at Anfield.
"It wasn't just Liverpool fans sticking up for themselves, it was Liverpool fans saying 'enough is enough' for every supporter across the land."
Last week, clubs failed to commit to a £30 cap on away tickets at the latest Premier League ­shareholders' meeting.
Football Supporters' Federation chief executive Kevin Miles said the next step in its campaign for fairer ticket prices will be discussed at a meeting next week.
One option could be a co-ordinated walk-out by fans of all 20 Premier League clubs during a weekend of matches.
