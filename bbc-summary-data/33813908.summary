Ashes 2015: Australia will not give up, says Michael Clarke

Australia captain Michael Clarke insists his side will not give up as they look to save the Ashes series following a disastrous first day for the tourists at Trent Bridge.

Clarke's side were bowled out for 60 before lunch as Stuart Broad took 8-15.
Joe Root then hit an unbeaten century as England scored 274-4 to establish a lead of 214.
"The Australian way is to never give up. That has to be our attitude," Clarke told Test Match Special.
"We have to come here tomorrow and bowl England out and then bat as big as we have done in this series."
Clarke's side came into the Test at Trent Bridge 2-1 down and knowing that a defeat would see the home side regain the Ashes.
However, they now face the prospect of a heavy defeat after being dismissed for their joint seventh-lowest Test score in 111 balls - the shortest first innings in Test history.
The Australia captain lost a key toss on Thursday, which allowed England to bowl first in favourable conditions on a wicket that offered incentive for the seam bowlers.
Broad, though, was exceptional, taking the equal fastest five-wicket haul in Test cricket before cleaning up the tail after Steven Finn and Mark Wood had claimed a wicket each.
"It didn't start well, losing the toss and getting sent in but you still have to execute and Stuart Broad was a class above today," continued Clarke.
"He put everything in the right area, we nicked everything and England's fielding was exceptional. Those conditions we faced today were as tough as we faced in a long time so to lose the toss was vital."
England lost Adam Lyth and Ian Bell cheaply, but 43 from captain Alastair Cook set the platform, which Root (124 not out) and Jonny Bairstow (74) capitalised on with a fourth-wicket stand of 173.
"The wicket flattened out a little bit after lunch but England played really well," added Clarke.
Australia made a surprise selection for the match, bringing in batsman Shaun Marsh at the expense of his all-rounder brother Mitchell, meaning Clarke had just three seamers at his disposal.
Towards the end of the day, Clarke turned to the part-time seam of opening batsman David Warner.
When questioned about this he replied: "You'll have to ask the selectors about that. They tried to pick the best XI and I don't think it would matter who we picked. Shaun Marsh has scored a couple of hundreds and is in good form but he got a good ball."
