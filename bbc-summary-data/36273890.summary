[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Britons and a Mexican have become the first foreigners to scale Everest in two years after deadly disasters forced climbers off the mountain.

Nepal Mountaineering Association's president Ang Tshering Sherpa said the climbers reached the 8,848m (29,029ft) summit shortly after 08:00 local time.
Britons Kenton Cool and Robert Richard Lucas made the top, along with Mexican David Liano and three Nepalese guides.
On Wednesday, nine Sherpa guides scaled Everest after two years of disruption.
Climbs from the Nepali side of Mount Everest have been hit by natural disasters during this time.
May is the best month for climbing and more expeditions are expected to reach the top in the next few days.
It was 42-year-old Cool's 12th successful climb of the world's highest peak, and 36-year-old Liano's sixth.
Cool told his wife, Jazz, in a phone call home to Gloucestershire that "the summit has never looked more beautiful" and it was "great to be back".
Last year an avalanche triggered by a powerful earthquake killed at least 18 climbers and in 2014 16 Sherpas were killed by an avalanche.
The two disasters meant that hardly any climbers were able to scale the peak.
Last year's climbing season was cancelled, and nearly all climbers in 2014 were forced to abandon their attempts.
However, one Chinese woman made an ascent in early May 2014, weeks after the deadly avalanche.
The Nepalese government has issued permits to 289 climbers who want to scale Everest this year.
