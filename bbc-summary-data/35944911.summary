The 30-year-old, who bowls leg-spin, will be available for the entire competition, and could play other forms of the game as well.
He toured England with Sri Lanka A in 2011 and dismissed Joe Root, Alex Hales and Ben Stokes when he took 6-23 against England Lions at Worcester.
Prasanna could make his debut against Leicestershire at Grace Road on 20 May.
"He's an exciting cricketer with plenty of experience and good stats, and having  him for the whole T20 Blast campaign is obviously a big plus for us," said head coach David Ripley.
Prasanna has played one Test, 25 one-day internationals and six T20 matches for Sri Lanka.
