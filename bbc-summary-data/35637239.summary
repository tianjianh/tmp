Promotion-chasing Walsall have now gone five games without a victory after a stalemate with battling Scunthorpe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saddlers left-back Andy Taylor's drive was tipped over by Luke Daniels and Paddy Madden had a free-kick for the Iron saved in a quiet first half.
Both sides stepped up their game after the restart, but Milan Lalkovic was thwarted by Daniels and Scunthorpe's Conor Townsend dragged just wide.
Walsall's Kieron Morris hit the bar late on with an offside flag raised.
The Iron went close to winning it themselves when substitute Tom Hopper's shot was cleared off the line by Paul Downing.
Walsall, who have drawn three of their last four games in their current winless run, have now failed to win at Bescot in five attempts since the turn of the year.
Walsall head coach Sean O'Driscoll told BBC WM 95.6:

"Everybody has got to hold their nerve a little bit. We're in a position where nobody is going to come to the Bescot and roll over.
"It was a game where we tried to do the right things throughout the 90 minutes.
"A lot of the times it probably didn't quite come off for us. But nobody's head went. They're an honest bunch of players and we've shown that."
Scunthorpe manager Nick Daws told BBC Radio Humberside:

"We were really quick out of the traps but we then seemed to indulge ourselves a little bit in possession of the football because we were allowed to do so. It kind of came away from how we have played in the last six games.
"We were playing against a good side so I'm slightly disappointed with the first half and we spoke about it at half-time. We asked them to put it right.
"We asked them to deal with the issues that we knew Walsall would cause us a problem and, in the second half, we did it well."
