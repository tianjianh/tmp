[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Clwydian hill range and area of outstanding natural beauty is bidding to become a dark sky reserve.

It would be the third area of Wales to be given the status, alongside Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons.
The International Dark Sky Association make the award to areas whose night sky is 'outstanding', and where light pollution is minimised.
There are 11 dark sky reserves across the world.
They include the National Park Exmoor, England, Aoraki Mackenzie in New Zealand, and Quebec's Mont-Megantic.
Clwydian range senior officer David Shiel said getting the recognition would be "significant".
"Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons have already achieved this - so we are quite keen to replicate the work," he added.
Up to 75% of street lamp light escapes up into the atmosphere, a major cause of light pollution, Mr Sheil said.
"There are so few places where you can really properly experience a night sky. It's good for wildlife - up to 60% of our wildlife species rely on darkness to find food.
"But it's also about recognising it as being really important for our own health and well-being."
The range are now working with Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham councils, as well as Natural Resources Wales (NRW), to reduce light pollution across the 389(150 miles) sq km area.
A series of events will be held over the summer.
