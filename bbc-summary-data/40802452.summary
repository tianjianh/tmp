Mr Webb was originally from Northampton but was living in St Neots. His father died six days before he did.
His family said he died doing a job he loved and was passionate about.
"Dave was a fun loving character who lived his life to the full. He was known for his large personality and sung his way through life," a family statement said.
The building site, which was formerly part of the Bombardier works complex, belongs to Seddon Homes.
A nearby resident said he had seen the crane being used to lift tools when it started to tilt and then fall.
The HSE said it is aware of the incident and is working fully with Cheshire Police in its investigation.
