WRU bans horns at Millennium Stadium sporting events

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spectators have been banned from using any type of horn at Millennium Stadium sporting events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has issued the ban to "protect the unique match day atmosphere of the venue".
Air horns are already banned from the stadium but the new rule extends to all horns, including the vuvuzela.
The WRU said the move follows "spectator feedback", adding that fans entering the Cardiff venue with horns could now be stopped by stewards.
