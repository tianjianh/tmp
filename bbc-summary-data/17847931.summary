Slovakia's constitutionally-guaranteed press freedom is generally respected and the media freely carry diverse views, says rights organisation Freedom House.
Many outlets are directly or indirectly owned by Slovak financial groups Penta and J&T. Some observers worry that this poses potential risks for editorial freedom. When Penta gained a stake in the respected centre-right daily Sme in late 2014, several senior editors resigned in protest and set up a new independent daily, Dennik N.
All the major newspapers are privately-owned. The best-selling daily is the tabloid Novy Cas.
There are 4.5 million internet users (InternetLiveStats.com, 2016). Azet.sk is the leading online portal.
All traditional media have an online presence and leading print titles are trying to monetise their content. Facebook is the most popular social network, followed by domestic platform Pokec.sk.
