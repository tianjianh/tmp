Tesco is to shut four stores and shed more than 300 jobs in Scotland as part of UK plans to reduce costs.

A total of 189 posts will be lost at the Tesco superstore in Kirkcaldy, while 68 will go with the closure of Tesco Metro in Grangemouth, near Falkirk.
A further 55 jobs will go at Tesco Homeplus in Edinburgh, while 14 will be lost at Tesco Express in Troon.
Tesco is closing 43 UK stores, shedding a total of 2,000 posts in the process.
The company is currently informing staff at the affected stores.
The Express and Homeplus stores will close on 15 March, with the Tesco Metros and superstores on the list closing on 4 April.
Tesco warned earlier this month that 43 stores would be shut, but did not identify them at that stage.
Chief executive Dave Lewis said: "The decision to close these stores has been exceptionally difficult to take.
"I recognise it will affect many hard working colleagues, our customers and the communities in which these stores are situated.
"Our priority is to explain what this announcement means for our colleagues and wherever possible, offer them alternative roles with Tesco."
Fife Council said it was working hard to minimise the impact of Tesco's closure of its Kirkcaldy store, where nearly 200 posts will go.
Council leader David Ross said: "This is a devastating blow for Kirkcaldy and especially for the 189 staff who work at the Tesco's store, and their families.
"I have already spoken to Tesco's corporate affairs manager and we will be meeting in the next few days.
"I want an explanation for their decision to pull out of what must be one of their busiest stores in Fife.
"I am keen to explore any opportunity for keeping the Kirkcaldy store open, but failing that we will be seeking assurances about the future for the staff and what can be done through redeployment or other ways of minimising the impact on them."
