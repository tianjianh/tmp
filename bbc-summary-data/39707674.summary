Sarries hope to better second-placed Exeter's result against Saints as they battle for a home play-off semi-final.
Already-relegated Bristol make two changes, as Jack O'Connell comes into the front row and Ollie Robinson returns to the back row.
The visitors could give a debut to prop Ollie Dawe from the replacements bench.
Veteran forward Kelly Brown and scrum-half Neil De Kock will make what could be their final appearances for Saracens at the Allianz after distinguished careers with the club.
Brown, 34, who has played for Sarries since 2010, will become the academy coach at the end of the season, while 38-year-old De Kock ends an 11-year stay in north London by moving back to South Africa.
There are further landmarks for Saracens, with Schalk Brits making his 200th appearance and captain-for-the-day Farrell playing his 150th game for the side.
Bristol backs coach Dwayne Peel told BBC Radio Bristol:
"There is an eagerness from the lads to finish the season very well.
"If we are competitive and really have a go at Saracens, we can be pleased with our performance.
"Saracens are a very difficult team to emulate. What they are is together, with world-class players, and fight to the end for each other."
