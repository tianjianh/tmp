[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kilmarnock's Miles Addison sidelined until late January after surgery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock defender Miles Addison is expected to be ruled out until late January after undergoing surgery on a troublesome foot injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old Englishman had already missed four games since going off injured after 25 minutes of the 5 November draw with Hamilton Accies.
Kilmarnock have won one one, drawn one and lost two games during his absence.
Addison has made 13 appearances since joining Kilmarnock this summer after leaving Peterborough United.
His absence, along with an injury to Jonathan Burn, leaves Kilmarnock short of central defenders for Saturday's Scottish Premiership visit by Inverness Caledonian Thistle.
Only Scott Boyd and Will Boyle are available to manager Lee Clark.
