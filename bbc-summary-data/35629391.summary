The 1.3 tonnes of cocaine was found packed inside 31 suitcases in September 2013 and was described as the biggest drugs haul ever made in the Paris area.
The drugs were said to have a street value in France of 200m euros (Â£169m).
It led to the arrest of Mr Dawes, who is originally from Nottinghamshire and is currently awaiting trial in France.
The investigation also led to the prosecution of the eight associates, who were all jailed at Nottingham Crown Court.
The drugs were seized at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport on 11 September 2013, after being brought transported on board an Air France flight from Caracas, Venezuela.
The National Crime Agency began investigating with international law enforcement agencies to identify the group behind the shipment, suspecting it had been arranged by Mr Dawes.
Spanish police arrested Mr Dawes at his villa in Benalmadena on the Costa del Sol in November 2015, accusing him of running Europe's "largest criminal organisation dedicated to drug trafficking, money laundering and murder".
Kane Price had been arrested straight after the airport drugs seizure, then released on bail, but the National Crime Agency monitored him and observed him receiving a kilo of MDMA from Oliver Junior on 11 June 2015.
The other associates were observed being involved in drug and cash exchanges during other surveillance operations.
Rob Hickinbottom, the National Crime Agency's regional commander for the Midlands, said the investigation was continuing and further arrests and prosecutions wee planned.
"We have successfully targeted his (Robert Dawes') criminal associates in the UK involved in drug trafficking and money laundering but our work does not stop here," he said.
