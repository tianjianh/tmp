Mark Selby said indecision cost him a 147 break in his first-round UK Championship win over Andy Hicks.

The reigning world champion fluffed the 12th red in the opening frame of his 6-1 victory in York.
But the miss was not as costly as it could have been, with the rolling prize money of £5,000 meaning the total top break fund stood at £10,000.
"A 147 is nice but it still only wins one frame. It's good if the money is a substantial amount as well," he said.
Selby, the 2012 UK champion, hit a memorable 147 at the Barbican in 2013.
"That was for about £59,000 and it wasn't at that yet. But it would have been a nice way to start the tournament," Selby added.
"I didn't make up my mind when I played the red I missed. I should have got up off the shot and started again."
But the Leicester potter, 33, said negotiating a tough opening match was all that mattered:
"Andy has been a semi-finalist at the World Championship and the UK and he is a difficult opponent," Selby added.
"I knew it would be tough and I would have to be on my toes so I am happy to get through."
