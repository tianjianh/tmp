Autumn Statement must contain cash help - Ó Muilleoir

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Finance Minister Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has said "significant capital funding" for Northern Ireland must be contained in the Chancellor's Autumn statement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His call for a financial dividend was made following a meeting in Newry with his Welsh and Scottish counterparts.
Philip Hammond will deliver his first major fiscal announcement on November 23.
Projects like the York Street Interchange could benefit from any extra cash flowing to Stormont.
Mr Hammond is facing calls for measures to give a post-referendum boost to the UK economy.
Mr Ó Muilleoir issued a statement along with Scottish Secretary for Finance Derek Mackay and Mark Drakeford, Welsh Secretary of Finance.
"Together we represent over ten million people across the devolved regions and I remain of the opinion that we are stronger speaking as one voice," said Mr Ó Muilleoir.
"We are calling for a stimulus to be included in the Autumn Statement to provide immediate and significant capital funding to accelerate the pace of investment in our infrastructure."
The meeting was called to discuss key financial issues ahead of talks with David Gauke, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, on Monday.
