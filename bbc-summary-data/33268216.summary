[SN]TITLE[SN]
Essex police officers put on notice over child abuse case handling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twenty-nine serving and former police officers have been put on notice as part of an investigation into Essex Police's handling of child abuse cases.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) probe relates to the handling of 49 child abuse inquiries reported between 2011 and 2015.
The IPCC said six officers were being criminally investigated.
Essex Police said it had already taken "a number of immediate actions to put things right".
The case has more than doubled in scope since the IPCC's enquiries began.
When it first announced its investigation into the team covering the north of Essex in February, it said it was investigating 12 officers. This now spans 25 serving officers and four former officers - all of whom are below the rank of assistant chief constable.
Areas being investigated include allegations of misconduct in public office and perverting the course of justice, although no officers have been arrested or charged in connection with the investigation.
Some 22 of the notices allege gross misconduct, and seven relate to alleged misconduct matters including:
Two officers have been suspended and most of the remainder moved to different areas of police work, Essex Police said.
Deputy Chief Constable Derek Benson said: "These investigations relate to issues we identified and referred to the IPCC.
"We took a number of immediate actions to put things right and will work with the IPCC to identify where further improvements need to be made.
"We are working closely with partner agencies and children's charities to ensure the force gets expert, independent advice, and the changes we have made to the way we investigate child abuse cases mean that our investigations will be of the highest standards possible.
"There is no more important issue to Essex Police than protecting children."
Essex police and crime commissioner for Essex, Nick Alston, said: "We must be careful not to pre-judge the outcome."
