Wimbledon 2016: What not to miss on day three

Can British qualifier Marcus Willis achieve the unthinkable? He shared the front pages after his remarkable win on Monday and his reward is a second-round match against seven-time Wimbledon champion Roger Federer.

When asked for his top tip on how to succeed on your Wimbledon debut, 25-year-old Willis - who beat world number 54 Ricardas Berankis on the opening day - said that it helped to have a banana in the kit bag.
But the world number 772 will need a morph into Bananaman if he is to shock the world and defeat 17-time Grand Slam champion Federer.
They are separated by 769 places in the world rankings and by a few million in prize money. Before Wimbledon, Willis had earned £220 on the court this year, but he is now guaranteed at least £50,000 thanks to his feats in south west London.
Federer? The 34-year-old third seed is aware of the "cool" story which has captured imaginations.
"It's going to be interesting," said the Swiss. "Plus, he is serve and volleying, which I love to see. He came up with some great, great shots. To beat a guy of Berankis' calibre in straight sets shows you how tough he is."
Willis' match with Federer is scheduled as the third match on Centre Court. They are expected to play at about 16:30 BST.
Djokovic is the defending champion, the world number one and favourite to progress to the third round at the expense of France's Adrian Mannarino, the world number 55.
The Serb, who has never played the 27-year-old, is scheduled second on Centre, following Agnieszka Radwanska's match with Kateryna Kozlova.
Watson and Konta were unable to complete their matches on Tuesday because of the rain so the British pair will try again on Wednesday.
British number one Konta was leading Monica Puig by a set before rain stopped play and will resume on court Court One at 13:00 BST.
Watson's match with Annika Beck did not even start before the skies opened. The pair will play on court 12 at 11:30 BST.
Dan Evans is the fourth Brit in action, he will play 30th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov on court two following the completion of Fernando Verdasco's match with Bernard Tomic.
