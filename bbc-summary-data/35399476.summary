The robber targeted the shop in Maryport's High Street at about 11:30 GMT and the 78-year-old woman "struggled" with him, police revealed.
A "significant" amount of money was taken during the raid and the gunman is still at large.
The offender is described as 6ft tall, of slim build, and wearing dark shiny "puffa jacket" with a hood.
Det Insp Dan St Quintin said: "This is a terrible incident which has left staff very shaken.
"We have a number of resources in the area searching for this offender."
