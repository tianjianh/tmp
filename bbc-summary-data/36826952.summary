Tuesday recorded the hottest temperature of the year in Wales so far, with highs of 32.4 C (90.3F) in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, and Cardiff.
Forecasters said it was due to a "plume of hot air" heading northwards from Iberia.
However, a yellow "be aware" warning for rain has been issued for the evening, with thunderstorms likely.
By Tuesday afternoon, temperatures had reached 32.2C (90F) in Usk, Monmouthshire, along with 31.8C (89.2F) in Gogerddan in Ceredigion and at RAF Valley on Anglesey.
Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said temperatures were expected to reach 30C (86F) in areas including Wrexham and Aberystwyth, with the weather slightly cooler at about 28C in Cardiff and Swansea.
But he warned that it could lead to "intense" thunderstorms later on in the day, with a risk of flash flooding in some areas.
The warning, which covers the whole of Wales, is in place from 17:00 BST on Tuesday until 18:00 on Wednesday.
