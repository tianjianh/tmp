Following reports that new legislation was being prepared, the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure told the BBC the draft had not yet been finalised.
The hardware would record the decisions made by a car's computer while being used in autonomous mode.
It could pinpoint the cause of a crash.
The draft law was expected to be sent to other ministries for approval this summer, Reuters reported.
Self-driving car technology has been under close scrutiny following the fatal crash of a Tesla vehicle being operated in Autopilot mode in May.
Tesla has repeatedly stated that its Autopilot functionality is still in development and is not intended to be used as a fully autonomous driving solution.
