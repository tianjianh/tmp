The man, Sayed Hamid Noori, was a TV anchor for the state network Radio Television Afghanistan. He had been stabbed to death.
Police said that Mr Noori received a telephone call late on Sunday which prompted him to leave his flat.
President Hamid Karzai has told the interior minister to investigate.
So far there are no indications of who killed Mr Noori or why.
"Someone called him and asked him to come down from his apartment last night. His body was found later by police in a tree-covered area near his home," deputy Kabul police chief Khalilullah Dastyar told the AFP news agency.
Correspondents say that Afghanistan remains one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists.
At least 14 have been killed because of their work since the Taliban were ousted by US-led forces in 2001, according to media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders.
Afghan Independent Journalists' Association (AIJA) head Rahimullah Samander said the government must do more to protect Afghan and foreign journalists.
"We strongly condemn this brutal act and urge the government not to ignore it like past incidents," he told the Reuters news agency.
