The 19-year-old won the Junior World Championship in 2014 alongside Bath's Charlie Ewels and Tom Woolstencroft.
Walker became the youngest forward to appear for Carnegie in 2013, playing against Bristol, and became their youngest-ever captain a year later.
"Now is the time for me to take the next step and I'm confident I've got what it takes to succeed," he said.
