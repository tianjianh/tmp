Cumbria Police said officers were set to move into the Â£8.5m building, on St Andrew's Way, by the summer.
The old station, on Market Street, was found to be no longer fit for purpose due to the limited number of custody suites, and would have been too expensive to refurbish.
It is going on the market with a guide price of Â£850,000.
Police and Crime Commissioner Richard Rhodes said: "It will be sad for the police to move from the existing building, but time and the demands of policing have changed.
"Therefore it is essential to have a building that meets the challenging demands of modern day policing."
