[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Arena Island bridge finished

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new bridge has been built over the River Avon in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Â£11m bridge links Arena Island to Cattle Market Road and will be a key route to the Bristol Arena.
Bristol Arena, a 12,000-seat venue set to open in 2017, will be built by contractor Populous which was chosen from a shortlist of five.
Communications and broadband cables plus "district heating" piping which provides green energy to businesses will be included beneath the bridge.
Work started on the 63-metre-long (207 ft) bridge in March and it is hoped it will help unlock new investment in the area to create more jobs.
It is open to cars, pedestrians and bikes, with 3.5 metres (11ft) of pedestrian and bike lanes on either side.
The bridge was funded by the Homes and Communities Agency
