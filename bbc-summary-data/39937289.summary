[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham and England left-back Danny Rose has undergone exploratory surgery on his left knee, delaying his return from injury until next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rose, 26, has not played since damaging medial ligaments at Sunderland on 31 January but had been expected to return before the end of the season.
He recently returned to training but it was discovered "the problem has not resolved fully", a club statement read.
"Therefore a decision has been made to proceed to surgery."
Rose made 21 appearances for Spurs this season, 18 of those in the league, and scored two goals.
