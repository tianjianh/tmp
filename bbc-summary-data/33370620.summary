The 29-year-old was released by Oxford in May after an injury-hit season where he failed to score a goal.
City boss Paul Tisdale is also looking at forward Alex Fisher, who has played abroad and most recently at Mansfield.
"I'm optimistic about it. We need to see him (Hoskins) train and hopefully that'll turn into something," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon.
"He'll be training with us for a couple of weeks and then we'll see."
Hoskins started his career at Rotherham and has also spent a season with Bristol Rovers.
"We tried really hard to sign him (previously) but someone trumped us, so I've got into the process of looking at his game before," added Tisdale.
"If we can get good value and give someone an opportunity, everyone's a winner. He's someone that's got pedigree."
Fisher, 25, spent last season at Mansfield but was not offered a new contract.
He has played for Belgian side Mechelen and Italian outfit Monza in recent years and spent time at the Glenn Hoddle Academy.
"We've had a little look at him and he'll possibly be coming back. He seems a very likeable chap and has a good touch," Tisdale said.
"He's a 'lead your front line' kind of striker, and so far so good, but the first week of pre-season's really hard to judge because you don't see the decision making so much."
