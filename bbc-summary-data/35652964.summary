Voter registration falls by 100,000 in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of people registered to vote in elections in Scotland has fallen for the first time since 2009.

Official figures showed that on 1 December, 2015, 4.03 million people were registered, down 100,000 on 2 March, 2015.
It is thought the drop is down to a move towards individual electoral registration (IER) rather than household-based form completion.
The deadline for registering to vote in May's Holyrood election is 18 April.
Andy O'Neill, head of the Electoral Commission in Scotland, said: "The registers published on 1 December, 2015 are a snapshot of the electorate at that time and they indicate there has been a reduction in the number of entries since the last registers were published under the household system.
"However, a lot more has and will continue to be done to ensure as many people as possible know that they need to register to vote before the deadline, and how they go about doing so."
He added that it was "quick and easy" to register online at www.gov.uk/register-to-vote.
