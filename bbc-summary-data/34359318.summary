The Duchess of Cambridge has visited a prison for the first time to view the work of a charity that helps inmates overcome drug and alcohol addictions.

Catherine met women prisoners at HMP Send, Woking, who have used the Rehabilitation of Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPt) programme.
She spoke to Kirsty Lacey, who used the scheme in 2008, and now works for an ex-offenders' charity in Gloucester.
The duchess said she was encouraged by the work at the prison.
"I was reminded today how addictions lie at the heart of so many social issues and how substance misuse can play such destructive role in vulnerable people's lives," she said.
"I saw again today that a failure to intervene early in life to tackle mental health problems and other challenges can have profound consequences for people throughout their lives.
"I am grateful to the women I met for sharing their difficult personal stories with me. It is encouraging to learn how organisations like RAPt are offering specialist support to help people break the cycle of addiction and look forward to a positive and crime free life."
RAPt runs a 12-step abstinence programme at HMP Send, which houses 282 inmates.
The duchess is a patron of the charity Action on Addiction and Kensington Palace said the visit reflected her "interest in learning how organisations support people living with substance misuse issues".
