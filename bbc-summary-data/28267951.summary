Car rolls into Llangollen Canal at Pontcysyllte Aqueduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A car has rolled into the canal near Wrexham's Pontcysyllte Aqueduct for the second time in months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No-one was injured when the red vehicle plunged into Llangollen Canal, Froncysyllte, leaving its roof visible above the water line.
It was parked in Woodlands Grove half a mile south of the aqueduct.
In April, Tomos Williams's Toyota Avensis needed to be pulled from the canal after it rolled down a slipway after the handbrake failed.
Mr Williams had been on a walk with girlfriend Jayne Roberts when the accident happened.
