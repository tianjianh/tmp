The injury-hit Premiership strugglers have signed 26-year-old Braid on a contract until the end of the season.
The versatile back, who can also play at centre or in the back three, won the most recent of his 21 caps in last weekend's 21-16 defeat in Romania.
He is due to join Worcester following Canada's match with Samoa on Friday.
Head coach Carl Hogg said: "With the recent injuries to Ryan Lamb and Tom Heathcote, we're delighted Connor is able to come in and bolster the side in the number 10 position.
"He has plenty of experience in goal-kicking while his versatility across the backline will also be of great benefit."
Warriors, who played adaptable youngster Jamie Shillcock at 10 for the first time in the Premiership in Friday's 18-17 home defeat by Northampton, have a lengthy injury list.
Skipper GJ van Velze has been missing since the second game of the season following a concussion injury, while Francois Hougaard has been ruled out for three months after shoulder surgery.
They began the month with a 15 first-team players sidelined following injuries, which prompted moves for Australian scrum-half Michael Dowsett and full-back Auguy Slowik.
Former Glasgow Warriors, London Scottish and Doncaster Knights goal-kicker Braid has also represented his country on the World Sevens circuit.
