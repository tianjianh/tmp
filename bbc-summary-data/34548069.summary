[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 52-year-old TV star, best known for Full House and ER, is due to appear in court for a hearing on Friday.
Stamos' arrest in Los Angeles followed reports of him "allegedly behaving strangely and driving erratically".
The actor,  who is currently working on two TV shows, could face a maximum six-month jail sentence if convicted of the misdemeanour offence.
Any jail time could disrupt work on both his current TV series.
New Fox series Grandfathered, which premiered last month, casts Stamos in the central role of a middle-aged man who discovers he has a son and infant granddaughter he never knew about.
The actor also has a recurring role in Fuller House, the Netflix reboot of sitcom Full House, which is shooting in Hollywood and set to debut on the streaming service next year.
Neither Fox nor Netflix made any comment on how the shows might be affected.
Rehab
A hearing at LA's Superior Court on Friday, could see a resolution to the case or the setting of a pre-trial hearing, which could mean any jail time for Stamos is unlikely before the new year.
Beverly Hills police declined to identify the drug Stamos had allegedly taken before his arrest, nor is it identified in the charging document.
Stamos, who was taken to hospital at the time of the incident on 12 June, checked into rehab following his arrest.
The actor played Jesse in the long-running sitcom Full House, which ran from 1987-1995, and went on to play Dr Tony Gates in medical drama ER for four years. He also had a recurring role in Glee as Dr Carl Howell.
