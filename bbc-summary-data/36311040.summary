Striker Martyn Waghorn says that signing players like Joey Barton and Niko Kranjcar would prove that Rangers mean business in the top flight.

Rangers are vying with Barton's present club, Burnley, to sign the 33-year-old.
And they have also been linked with a move for 31-year-old Kranjcar, who is presently with New York Cosmos.
"They have a huge amount of experience and for us as a club to be looking at players like that is only a positive," said Waghorn.
"The quality of these two players is different class. They have shown over the years what they can do in the Premiership down south."
Barton, who won one England cap, and Croatia international Kranjcar played together in midfield at Queens Park Rangers.
"Joey Barton is known as a tough-tackling midfielder, but if you look at his performances for Burnley this year, he can play a bit as well," said former Sunderland, Leicester City and Wigan Athletic striker Waghorn.
"He would be great experience-wise for the middle of the park.
"It would be great competition for guys like Andy Halliday, Jason Holt, Dean Shiels and Nicky Law, who have all done great this year."
Rangers have already won the Scottish Championship title and promotion, with the signature of 19-year-old Liverpool midfielder Jordan Rossiter being secured for next season.
Now they are preparing for Saturday's Scottish Cup final against Hibernian, with a place in the Europa League qualifiers as a prize for the winners.
"If we get into the Europe League, competition will be key," said Waghorn. "You need to have a squad that is competitive from number one to 20.
"We've been linked with Barton and Kranjcar, but the signing of the young boy Jordan Rossiter is another key one.
"I've spoken to a few people down at Liverpool and they speak highly of him.
"So our intentions are good. The higher the calibre of player we have, the more it will bring out the best in the guys here, so the more the merrier."
