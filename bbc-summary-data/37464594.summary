Paddy McGill scored an early goal for Cushendall but Shay Casey nudged Loughgiel ahead by finding the net and his side led 1-8 to 1-5 at half-time.
Loughgiel maintained their three-point lead to secure victory.
In football, Kilcoo won the Down senior title for a fifth successive year by beating Clondiff 3-11 to 0-8 at Newry.
Aaron Morgan and man-of-the-match Daryl Branagan goals helped Kilcoo to a 2-8 to 0-1 half-time lead, while Ceilum Doherty found the net after the interval.
Eugene Branagan was sent off in the second half.
Ballygalget won the Down Senior Hurling Final at Portaferry as they beat Ballycran 0-6 to 0-2 on Saturday.
Neither side could register a score in the second half as appalling weather conditions made playing hurling virtually impossible as Ballygalget avenged last year's narrow final defeat.
Meanwhile, Loup qualified for the Derry SFC decider by beating Ballinascreen 4-9 to 0-10 at Owenbeg.
Thomas Mallon scored Loup's first goal in the first half directly from a 45 and Ballinascreen suffered a further blow before the break as Barry Grant received a straight red card for an apparent strike on an opponent.
Leading 1-4 to 0-6 at the break, Loup increased their advantage and a Jason Rocks goal with 13 minutes left extended their lead to seven.
Loup's victory was rounded off by further goals from Ciaran Devlin and Paul McVey.
Holders Slaughtneil saw off Ballinderry 2-09 to 0-9 at Owenbeg in Sunday's second last-four clash.
On Friday night, Killyclogher beat Dromore 1-9 to 0-11 in the first Tyrone SFC semi-final at Healy Park, with Clonoe and Coalisland having to replay the second semi-final after they drew 0-10 apiece at Edendork on Sunday.
Holders Crossmaglen, Cullyhanna and Maghery progressed to the semi-finals of the Armagh SFC thanks to quarter-final triumphs on Sunday.
Cross saw off Armagh Harps 1-12 to 1-6, Cullyhanna defeated Wolfe Tone's 1-13 to 1-7 and Maghery were 1-15 to 2-5 victors over Dromintee.
Ryan McShane found the net for the Harps, but Tony Kernan responded with a goal for Crossmaglen.
