Dettori, 45, had been booked for Fascinating Rock before trainer Dermot Weld decided the 2015 Champions Stakes winner would not make the race.
Dettori is aiming for a fifth win in the 12-furlong feature after victory on Golden Horn last year.
Order Of St George, trained by Aidan O'Brien, suffered defeat in the Irish Ledger last time out.
Dettori hopes that O'Brien has coaxed the four-year-old back to the form that could trouble favourite Postponed however.
"Postponed is clearly the biggest threat. It's difficult to see any flaws in the favourite but my horse is trained by a genius. Now I've had the good news confirmed I can relax a bit and start looking forward to a big run," he wrote in his blog for bookmaker Ladbrokes.
