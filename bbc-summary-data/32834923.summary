Camera shy: The mysterious man behind Humans of Leeds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A photography project featuring portraits and interviews collected on the streets of Leeds is the focus of a new exhibition. The art show offers a glimpse into the lives of strangers and tells the story of a diverse and vibrant city. But who is the mysterious man behind the camera?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Step one foot in Leeds city centre and chances are, you'll be stopped by someone.
Charity workers, students flyering for nightclubs and the poor soul paid to hold a sandwich shop placard for eight hours are just some of those trying to get your attention as you fight your way to the shops.
One person you won't find walking up and down the main, pedestrian thoroughfare is the man behind philanthropic photography project, Humans of Leeds.
An IT consultant by trade, he spends his lunch hour walking the city's side-streets, people-watching until he spots the perfect picture.
"I stay away from the areas where people [think] they're going to be approached," says the self-taught snapper.
"You're fighting a battle because people are constantly being bombarded. I never go on Briggate because people expect to be stopped on there."
Though he prefers to remain anonymous, he concedes to being called 'Z' in print.
Since starting the project two years ago, he has photographed more than 600 people and his Facebook page has more than 14,000 fans.
The 38-year-old from Batley has come a long way from buying his first professional camera in 2011.
"I just went out one day and started doing street photography," he explains. "It sounds quite nonchalant, but it wasn't, the first day was difficult. Approaching a stranger and asking for a picture is very hard.
"I walked around for a few hours before I plucked up the courage to speak to the first person. I must have looked really nervous because they said no straight away."
Though based on the hugely successful photoblog Humans of New York, Z's approach to his blog is more relaxed. Rather than attempting to photograph 10,000 residents like his American counterpart, he speaks to about 15 people a week.
Incredibly he's only failed to connect with one person he stopped for a chat. "She had nothing to say," he shrugs.
But whether it takes a few minutes or an hour, Z aims to keep the blog varied by speaking to a cross-section of people.
"The most common question I get asked is who do you stop?" says Z. "But it's the hardest question because when I walk down the street it's different every time.
"When the project first started it was very visually based, if they were dressed a certain way or there was something colourful or unique about them, it was easy to pick them out. But it's moved on.
"The photo gives a visual representation of the person but it's the story that makes a connection with the person reading it."
â€œI was diagnosed with a brain tumour when I was 10. To remove it they had to go through the area affecting my sight. My parents had the difficult decision of weighing that up."
A flick through the Humans of Leeds photo album on Facebook reveals a wide range of stories.
Some make difficult reading, a marker perhaps of the very English tendency for self-deprecation, or the unfortunate reality that the worst details make the best stories.
"I think it's about the difficulties you face in day-to-day life," says Z. "I try to ask about happy moments but they seem to be quite generic.
"If you ask a couple about the happiest moment of their life, it's usually to do with their kids and it's hard to get a different answer. If you ask about the saddest moment, it's always different because it's very specific to that person."
The fact that people are willing to share something so deeply personal is a testament to Z's ability to coax a story out of people he's only just met.
But how does a stranger with a camera get people to open up so freely?
"It's about breaking it into chunks. You can't go out and say 'tell me your life story'. It's a very difficult thing to do on the spot. You have to ask lots of questions," he says.
"One girl told me she attempted suicide. She hadn't told anyone yet, apart from her mum. It's quite strange that people can't tell their closest friends and family, but when a complete stranger asks them, they open up.
"I respect people who do that. I'm delving into their lives and it's not the easiest thing to do."
What's the key to a healthy relationship? A good argument. Have one early in the day, then make up in the afternoon."
Though Humans of New York became a global sensation, its success is not why Z started his own version. He wanted to know whether the people of Leeds were as open as those across the pond - an added bonus was finding that he loved to hear their stories.
"If I just went about my business, going to work, going home, I'd never interact with other people. It's about that connection with people I don't know anything about, getting to know their stories," he says.
"This way, I get to meet people and talk to people I wouldn't get to talk to normally. The older generation are my favourite to photograph but they're the hardest to get.
"They've got that breadth of knowledge and life experience, so it's a shame when they say no. But if I go through enough people, I will get one. I just have to play the numbers game."
Though not on the same scale as its American forerunner, Humans of Leeds has developed something of a cult following, so much so that it peaked the interest of PR company, SLB.
In conjunction with Leeds Beckett University, the firm has given Z his first solo exhibition at event space, Lambert's Yard.
The launch night of the show, entitled So & So, was so popular a second run of tickets had to be printed. Unbeknown to curious art lovers, the mysterious man was there too, though he never made himself known.
It seems ironic that a photographer who asks strangers to share details of their lives prefers to remain anonymous.
"It wasn't something I planned when I started. I just wanted to take portraits," he says. "People don't need to know who I am, what does it matter? It's about the humans of Leeds, not me."
So & So runs until 8 July.
