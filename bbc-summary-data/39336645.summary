Rush-hour drivers faced snowy conditions in parts of Scotland after wintry weather hit overnight.

A jack-knifed lorry on the A8 westbound at Newhouse in North Lanarkshire caused delays earlier but has now been cleared.
Visibility was poor on parts of the M74 through Lanarkshire and Glasgow and there were reports of cars losing control on the M77.
Traffic Scotland urged motorists to take care.
It said the A702 near Penicuik in Midlothian had been closed between Flotterstone and Mauricewood after "multiple" small accidents in the wintry conditions.
Scotland Transerv, which is responsible for maintaining the roads in south west Scotland, said it had 32 gritters out overnight.
Speaking earlier from Traffic Scotland's control centre, Stein Connelly, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the picture on the roads was "improving".
He said: "We have had some really serious drops of snow, particularly across the central belt.
"We had 158 gritters out last night. We were planning for this. We work closely with the Met Office and throughout the morning we have been working with Police Scotland."
He added: "Don't be complacent. Plan your journey and give an extra bit of space between you and the car in front just to be on the safe side."
The Met Office had issued a  yellow "be aware" warning for most of central and western Scotland, which was in place until 10:00.
Forecasters said it was not unusual to see snow at the start of spring.
On average, the UK experiences more days of snow falling in March than December, the Met Office added.
