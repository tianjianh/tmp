Gibraltar is the newest addition to the international game after been accepted as a full member of Uefa, European football's governing body in May 2013.
"This is a fantastic opportunity for me," said the 33-year-old centre-back.
"To have the chance of playing international football is the dream of any player."
Gibraltar are building towards the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, having marked their debut as a Uefa member last November by holding Slovakia to a goalless draw.
"To be part of Gibraltar's emergence at this level of the game is also special," added Artell, who qualifies through his father.
"[Wrexham manager] Andy Morrell has been very supportive and it will mean missing the league game at Hereford United, but it's an opportunity I could not miss out on."
Gibraltar have also called-up Forest Green Rovers striker Reece Styche, currently on loan at Wycombe Wanderers, and Danny Higginbotham, who retired from club football last month after a spell with Chester earlier this season.
Also travelling from the UK will be Will Britt (Southampton), Scott Wiseman (Preston) and Adam Priestley (Farsley).
