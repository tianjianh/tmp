The 23-year-old joined Tigers on trial in February before initially agreeing a deal for the rest of this term.
The former Leeds Rhinos and London Broncos man made his Castleford debut against Huddersfield Giants in May.
"I'm over the moon to sign here for another two years. It's a great place to be," he told Tigers' club website.
