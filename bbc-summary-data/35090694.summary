The timing of engineering work on a busy stretch of railway has been criticised by a local MP.

The line between Tonbridge and Hastings is being closed after 21:00 GMT on Monday and Tuesday to allow worn out components to be replaced.
It is understood the work will take several months to complete.
Greg Clark, MP for Tunbridge Wells, said the work had been poorly publicised, however, Network Rail said there was "no good time" to do it.
Mr Clark said: "To do this just before Christmas without consultation is completely wrong.
"It will be a terrible shock to many of my constituents travelling home after a long and busy day."
Network Rail's route managing director for the south east, Alasdair Coates, said: "There is no good time to do this work and it is almost impossible to do so without impacting on passengers.
"However, I'm confident that this will plan keep the railway open as long as possible, while also improving journeys for everybody."
A rail replacement bus service will run instead of trains while the line is closed.
