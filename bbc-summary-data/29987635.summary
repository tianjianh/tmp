[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The rumour mill has been working hard for a while but plans for Band Aid 30 have been confirmed.

Bob Geldof, who launched the original Band Aid, announced "the worst kept secret in the world" at a press conference in London.
One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sande are among the acts appearing on the fourth version of Do They Know It's Christmas.
Band Aid 30 will raise money to combat the Ebola crisis in West Africa.
Speaking at the launch Geldof said: "The lyrics will be less about hunger, but Band Aid still says Feed the World.
"It really doesn't matter if you don't like this song. It doesn't matter if you hate the artists. What matters is that you buy the record."
He added versions of Band Aid will be recorded in the US, France and Germany with the likes of Daft Punk and producer Quincey Jones being involved around the world.
Bob Geldof and Midge Ure first gathered musicians together for the charity single in 1984, it was the biggest selling song that year.
The original single, inspired by a 1984 BBC News report about the famine in Ethiopia, lead to a cross-continent event called Live Aid in London and Philadelphia, which raised more than Â£40m for charity.
Do They Know It's Christmas? was recreated in 1989 with appearances from Cliff Richard and Kylie before Chris Martin, Dido and Busted were among the names on the 2004 version.
Some of this year's artists will record in London on 15 November
As well as One Direction, Ed Sheeran and Emeli Sande, Bastille, Elbow, Jessie Ware, Paloma Faith, Foals, Olly Murs, Queen's Roger Taylor, Sinead O'Connor and Underworld are among the names confirmed so far.
Bono and Chris Martin will also be returning.
During the press conference, Bob Geldof said Rita Ora is one of the names on his list who couldn't take part because of commitments with the BBC show The Voice.
But in a statement the BBC says it's more than happy for Rita to be involved and The Voice production team is liaising with her management to work around a major diary clash.
Bono's "Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you" is the only line of the song to be sung by the same artist on more than one version.
Chris Martin is back this time as well though, so there's potential for him to perform the opening lines again.
Based on the initial announcement, it looks like Dizzee Rascal will still be the only person to rap on a Band Aid single.
The new version will be recorded this Saturday and should be available for download on Monday morning.
