Slavisa Jokanovic: Fulham boss takes blame for penalty woe after seventh failure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic says he is to blame for their poor record from penalties - as he chooses the taker.

Chris Martin's failure from 12 yards in Tuesday's 1-0 defeat at Reading means the Whites have seen seven of their last nine spot-kicks saved or missed.
"I changed the taker five times and the only one who scored a goal is Chris," Jokanovic told BBC Radio London.
"It is not a lottery. We will think what is best for us and try and find a better solution."
We miss many times this season and it is a frustrating situation.
Martin saw his 90th-minute penalty saved by Royals keeper Ali Al-Habsi at the Madejski Stadium, meaning Fulham missed the chance to close the gap on the Championship play-offs.
The Whites are five points off sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday after 27 games of the campaign.
On-loan Scotland international Martin has scored twice from the spot this season, in wins over Huddersfield and Barnsley, but has now had his other three efforts saved.
Other recent misses have proved costly for the Whites, with QPR keeper Alex Smithies denying Martin in the west London derby on Saturday and Brighton stopper David Stockdale keeping out Stefan Johansen's penalty on 2 January.
Both those games were goalless at the time, and Fulham went on to pick up just one point from the six available in those matches.
The west London club even missed two penalties in the 2-1 defeat by QPR back in October, with Tom Cairney and Sone Aluko the culprits.
"I cannot blame my players as it is my decision," Serb Jokanovic, 48, added.
"We miss many times this season and it is a frustrating situation. We are disappointed in the dressing room, like our supporters.
"I have never seen something like this."
Reading have also struggled with penalties this season, missing six of their 11 spot-kicks - but Jaap Stam's side have converted five of those misses on the rebound.
