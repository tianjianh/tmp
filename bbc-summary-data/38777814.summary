[SN]TITLE[SN]
Six Nations: Anthony Watson an injury doubt for England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England winger Anthony Watson is a doubt for the Six Nations opener against France after suffering a hamstring strain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old Bath man will have a scan on Saturday.
If Watson, who missed the autumn internationals with a broken jaw, is ruled out, then it could present an opportunity to Gloucester's Jonny May.
England, Grand Slam winners in 2016, start their title defence at Twickenham on 4 February.
