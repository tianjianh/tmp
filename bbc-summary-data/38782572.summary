Raheem Wilks, brother of Leeds United under-23 player Mallik Wilks, was shot shortly before 13:20 GMT on Thursday in the Harehills area of Leeds.
West Yorkshire Police said a 21-year-old man and a woman, 20, were in custody.
A 49-year-old man arrested on Friday also remains in custody, officers said.
Mr Wilks was found seriously injured outside Too Sharps on Gathorne Terrace. He was taken to hospital for treatment but died later on Thursday evening.
Police said on Friday it was believed to have been "a targeted attack" on Mr Wilks.
Det Ch Insp Stuart Spencer said the force was continuing to maintain an increased presence in the area to reassure residents.
He added: "I believe the answer to what happened lies in the local community and I am appealing directly to anyone with any information to come forward."
Forensic teams remain at the site of the shooting.
