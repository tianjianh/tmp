[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP won every seat in Tayside on the way to a Scotland-wide landslide in the general election.

The party gained Dundee West from Labour and held Dundee East, completing a clean sweep of the city where it already held both Holyrood seats and the council.
It also held Angus and Perth and North Perthshire, and gained Ochil and South Perthshire, Falkirk and Stirling.
Labour lost out in each of the gains on a catastrophic night for the party.
The SNP's Chris Law overturned a Labour majority of more than 7,000 in Dundee West, winning 61.9% of the vote on the way to beating Labour candidate Michael Marra by more than 17,000 votes.
Dundee East representative Stewart Hosie, also the party's deputy leader, saw his majority soar from 1,800 at the last election to more than 19,000, winning 59.7% of the vote.
In Angus, the SNP's Mike Weir also increased his majority, winning 54% of the vote and almost twice as many votes as his nearest challenger, Conservative candidate Derek Wann. Mr Weir thanked the people of Angus for "putting their trust in me and the SNP".
Pete Wishart, formerly the SNP's chief whip at Westminster, also took more than half of the vote in Perth and North Perthshire, finishing almost 10,000 votes clear of his Conservative opponent Alexander Stewart.
Mr Wishart said it had been a "fantastic night", adding that he was "not going to be so lonely any more" at Westminster.
Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh took Ochil and South Perthshire for the SNP, toppling Labour's Gordon Banks by a margin of more than 10,000 votes.
In Stirling, Steven Paterson also took what had been a Labour seat by a five-figure margin, finishing 10,000 votes clear of Labour candidate and city council leader Johanna Boyd.
Labour suffered an even heavier defeat in Falkirk, where the SNP's John McNally polled 19,701 more votes than Labour rival Karen Whitefield. The area's previous representative, Eric Joyce, won a majority of 7,843 in 2010.
