Men to stand trial accused of canal murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men will stand trial accused of murdering a man by forcing him from a bridge into the Forth and Clyde Canal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Munro, 30 and James Robertson, 27, are accused of killing Russell Robertson in Falkirk in May.
Prosecutors allege the 27 year-old was seized by the neck, restrained, thrown to the ground and then pushed over bridge railings.
The two men are accused of assaulting Mr Robertson while he clung to the bridge.
They are alleged to have punched Mr Robertson on the hands and prised his fingers from the railings, causing him to fall into the canal.
Mr Munro, of Denny, Stirlingshire, and Mr Robertson, of Pitlochry, Perthshire, deny the allegations.
During a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow, a trial was scheduled to take place next July.
Following his death, Mr Robertson's family said: "We are totally devastated at the loss of Russell.
"He was much loved son, brother, nephew and uncle."
