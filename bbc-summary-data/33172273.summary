[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was found dead days after being raped by a fake taxi driver killed herself, a coroner has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ceri Linden, 20, from Mochdre, Conwy county, took an overdose of tablets one week after she was attacked.
Coroner Nicola Jones recorded a verdict of suicide at an inquest in Llandudno on Wednesday.
In April, police said Miss Linden's powerful video interview with officers helped convict attacker Masood Mansouri "from beyond the grave".
Miss Linden flagged down a car she thought was a taxi after a night out in Chester on 10 August 2014 but Mansouri took her back to his home and attacked her.
The inquest heard that on 17 August, Miss Linden's mother, Eleri, was talking to her daughter at their home when she admitted taking an overdose.
Mrs Linden dialled 999 and her daughter was taken to hospital where she died.
The inquest heard Mrs Linden had concerns that it took the ambulance 45 minutes to arrive and she believed there could have been a different outcome had it arrived sooner.
After the hearing, Brendan Lloyd, the Welsh Ambulance Service's medical director, said: "We would like to extend our thoughts and deepest sympathies to Miss Linden's family at this very difficult time.
"Following her death, we received a concern about our response on that day from a representative of the family, which was fully investigated, and the findings from which shared with her family.
"If her family feel they have more questions, we would be more than happy - when they feel comfortable and ready - to meet with them and answer their questions as best we can."
