The border collies, said to be worth a five-figure sum, were stolen from the Cairnie area, north of Huntly on Thursday.
Three of the dogs were found on Friday. The fourth dog, a 10-year-old female, was found safe and well in the Huntly area on Saturday.
Police said the dog was found after "extensive house-to-house inquiries".
PC Shiree Miller said: "I am delighted that the last remaining of the border collies has now been traced and is back with its owners.
"Extensive inquires will continue to find out who is involved in this distressing theft.
"I would once again reiterate our thanks to the members of the public in the area who assisted in the safe finding of the fourth dog, which is the most experienced working dog of the four."
Anyone with information should contact police.
