[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police and fire crews were called to the scene, close to Lesmahagow, at about 10:30 on Friday after a tanker carrying highly-flammable ethanol caught fire.
No-one was injured as a result of the blaze.
The motorway was closed in both directions for several hours, with queues of up to nine miles reported.
About 100 firefighters were involved in efforts to extinguish the blaze.
Deputy Assistant Chief Officer Paul Connelly, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: "The nature of the fuel involved in the fire meant it was both intense and very difficult to extinguish.
"Large volumes of water were deployed from multiple jets and our crews also conducted several foam strikes to smother the flames.
"Considerable resources were mobilised from across the west of Scotland to conduct a safe and effective firefighting operation, which has ultimately seen the fire extinguished.
He added: "Our crews will remain at the scene over the coming hours while the remaining ethanol is removed from the vehicle."
