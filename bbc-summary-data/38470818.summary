Saints captain Anderson claims he was punched by Kiernan during last week's 1-1 draw between the sides.
"It was a corner and he caught me in the ribs. It was a clear punch on me," Anderson said after the match.
The Scottish FA disciplinary hearing regarding the incident at McDiarmid Park will take place on 12 January.
Anderson said that Kiernan, who was free to play in Saturday's defeat by Celtic, deserved any punishment that may arise from the incident.
"You can't do that in football games," he said. "I'm not bothered, but if it gets highlighted then he deserves it."
Rangers manager Mark Warburton, however, defended Kiernan.
"There's nothing in that," he said. "I've watched it again - it's a push.
"If you punish that, there will be more judicial panels than you could possibly imagine."
