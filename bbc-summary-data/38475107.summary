Eastleigh P-P Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tuesday's National League game between Eastleigh and Macclesfield has been postponed because of a frozen pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was decided that the surface at the Silverlake Stadium was unsafe during an 08:45 GMT inspection on Tuesday.
Eastleigh must now wait until Saturday's visit of struggling Woking as they look to record their first league win of 2017.
They are 12th in the National League table, eight points adrift of the play-off places and two behind Macclesfield.
