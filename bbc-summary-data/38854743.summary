[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog breeder has been handed a 15-year ban after a probe uncovered dozens of animals in "disgusting conditions" at a property in Lanarkshire.

Morag Jackson, who is 55 and from Stonehouse, was found to have 36 breeding dogs and puppies in two sheds and a garage in August last year.
Scottish SPCA inspectors said some were deprived of food, water and had lice.
The ban was imposed despite Jackson's attempts to overturn it at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
When Scottish SPCA officials arrived at the property they found two wooden sheds with at least eight dogs, and a separate garage which housed nursing bitches with young puppies.
Inspector Joanne Boyle said: "There was a West Highland terrier hidden away in a carrier who had a severe skin complaint and also had alopecia. She had no access to light, food or water.
"The canines were being kept in disgusting conditions, the bedding was soaked with urine and there was a lot of faeces.
"There was a lack of food and water available for the dogs, any water which was present appeared discoloured and littered with debris, it was completely inappropriate for any animal to be supplied with."
Ms Boyle said a number of the dogs had a lice infestation and bad skin conditions, which would have been causing them a lot of pain and discomfort.
She added: "We welcome the fact that Jackson has been dealt with by the court and the sentence handed down. We hope she will give serious consideration about her suitability to care for other animals in the future.
"Thankfully, the dogs have now received the proper treatment and have made a full recovery."
