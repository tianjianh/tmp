The pitch:
Prof Hamish Laing, medical director, said: "Both Morriston and the Heath are excellent hospitals, this isn't really so much about the hospitals. We have nearly all the services you need for a major trauma centre.
"We have some services that are not in Cardiff and Cardiff has some that are not here. The NHS can sort that out; you can move services or individuals around."
"The key thing that Morriston offers is the greatest opportunity for the most people - the greatest coverage of south Wales - to be [here] within an hour," said Prof Laing.
"Because it's sitting by the motorway, it means it's much easier to access from the other side of Haverfordwest, the other side of Brecon or Newport."
