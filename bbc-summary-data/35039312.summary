Named Kunbarrasaurus, it was thought to be part of a group dinosaurs that ate plants and were known for their heavy armour and club-like tails.
Researchers at the University of Queensland think it had a parrot-like beak and an inner ear similar to a turtle.
The fossil was discovered back in 1989 and originally thought to be the same as Australia's only other ankylosaur â€” Minmi.
But 20 years later, and after a lot of work, they found it was a new species entirely.
The skeleton even includes details such as skin texture and stomach contents - check out the 3D model.
