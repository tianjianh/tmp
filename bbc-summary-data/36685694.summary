The 25-year-old Welsh swimmer held off American Leah Smith in the final 50 metres to win Team GB's second medal of the night moments after Adam Peaty won 100m breaststroke gold.
"I can't believe it. I'm on the edge of tears," Carlin told the BBC.
Ledecky dominated to finish in a time of three minutes 56.46 seconds.
Carlin touched home in 4:01.23 and Smith took bronze in 4:01.92.
The British silver medallist added: "It's an incredible feeling and it's definitely not sunk in yet.
I was in the pool room watching Adam and I had goosebumps on the block
"I'm so grateful for everyone's support back home and anyone who got up to watch in the ridiculous hours of the morning - I'm just over the moon.
"I wanted to come here and give it absolutely everything and have no regrets. Sometimes you swim and think I could have a bit left, but I wanted to get myself into the race rather than always having to catch up and then absolutely go for it.
"I could see Katie was a bit in front and having a great swim so I just tried to hang on. I'm gobsmacked to come away with silver.
"I was in the pool room watching Adam and I had goosebumps on the block. To see someone who's your team-mate achieve a new world record and become Olympic champion right before you swim definitely got me pumped up."

Carlin missed out on selection at London 2012 but bounced back two years later at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, where she won gold in the 800m freestyle and silver in the 400m event.
She said: "Four years ago I was sat in the stand cheering Team GB on but now I'm actually part of the team and to come away with a silver medal is absolutely amazing."
Winner Ledecky, who won 800m freestyle gold at London 2012, said: "I'm pumped. Swimming 3:56 feels really good. I've been so close before. It's pure happiness.
"I felt good throughout. I had a lot left at the end. I just had more pop on the last lap."
