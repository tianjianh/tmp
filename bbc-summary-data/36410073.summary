[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset pulled off a remarkable run chase to earn a thrilling one-wicket victory over Surrey at Taunton.

Set a target of 301, Somerset were 270-9, but Jack Leach (24 not out) and Tim Groenewald (18 not out) saw them home.
Somerset opener Marcus Trescothick hit 56, with good contributions from Jim Allenby (56) and Peter Trego (44), while Surrey skipper Gareth Batty claimed match figures of 10-115.
Earlier, Surrey fell from 94-6 to 138 all out as Jamie Overton took 4-18.
Surrey looked to be heading for their first County Championship win of the season when they took four quick wickets after tea to leave Somerset 237-8 - still requiring 64 to win.
Overton's counter-attacking 29 off 27 balls gave the hosts momentum, before wicketkeeper Ben Foakes pulled off a stunning one-handed catch to dismiss him off Stuart Meaker (4-79).
With Somerset still needing 31 for victory when Overton went, Surrey searched desperately for the final wicket with Batty bowling 18 consecutive overs.
However, Leach and number 11 Groenewald batted sensibly for the last hour on a pitch that was still turning to give Somerset their first win of the season after six successive draws.
Surrey head coach Michael Di Venuto told BBC Radio London:
"I don't think I've ever been as nervous on a cricket field in any game. I can't fault their efforts today, they really stuck in and we've just come up short unfortunately.
"They busted their guts, we tried everything, but Somerset's last pair played really well.
"Full credit to Somerset for chasing down the highest score of the match on a wicket that was turning and still offering a little bit for the fast bowlers."
