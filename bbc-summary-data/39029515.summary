Tamsin Greenway: Wasps Netball will do 'crazy stuff' like Premiership counterparts

Wasps boss Tamsin Greenway wants her Superleague netball side to play with the same adventure and bravado that has carried the club's rugby union team to the top of the Premiership.

Eight months after the rugby club won its bid to expand into the sport, Wasps netball make their debut on Tuesday.
Wasps are the most prolific side in English rugby this term, but have the second worst defence in the top nine.
"At times we will do crazy stuff, a bit like the rugby," said Greenway.
"We're not going to play safe netball. Defensively, we will attack the game to win the ball. This is not about shutting people down, this is about turning over the ball, bringing the ball trough the court at pace."
Greenway, 34, took the helm at Wasps after coaching Surrey Storm to a second successive Superleague title in 2016.
She brought several Surrey players with her, including last season's top scorer Rachel Dunn, while fellow England international Natalie Haythornthwaite moved to Wasps from Manchester and South Africa captain Bongiwe Msomi returned to the English league to reunite with Greenway.
The decorated coach and former England international has labelled it her "dream team" and admits Wasps have "become a target", but is adamant "high-risk" netball is what it will take to make the club a success.
"When people come to sport they want to be entertained, right? I want people to see athletes that are playing with flare, taking risks," Greenway said.
"With the team we have brought in, we have the capabilities of doing that.
"I've brought in a team that is good enough to win the league. We want to be successful, it has to be successful and if we want to get people into the building we need to win games and make sure that this community loves this sport and into Wasps."

Wasps' Superleague debut against a fellow expansion club Sirens will be a sell-out at Glasgow's Emirates Arena.
The season began over the weekend when Severn Stars, the third of the three new clubs in the 10-team competition, were beaten 58-40 by defending champions Surrey, in Tania Hoffman's first match in charge.
Hertfordshire Mavericks defeated Team Northumbria in the season's opening game on Friday, with Team Bath winning at Celtic Dragons, while Loughborough Lightening overcame last season's losing finalists Manchester Thunder.
