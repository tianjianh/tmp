The vlogger's book Girl Online has become the fastest selling debut novel since records began.
She tweeted she was "blown away" after more than 78,000 copies were picked up in its first week.
That's more than Harry Potter author JK Rowling and EL James, who wrote 50 Shades of Grey, achieved with their debuts.
The record is the highest since Nielsen BookScan began collecting information on the book market in 1998, according to The Bookseller.
Girl Online, which is the first of a two-book deal with Zoella and Penguin, is also the fastest-selling hardback of 2014.
It's been a busy year for Zoella - or Zoe Sugg.
The 24-year-old was signed up to be a part of a BBC Radio 1 show with presenters Dan and Phil, won a Radio 1 Teen Award for best British vlogger and was asked by Bob Geldof to sing on the Band Aid 30 track Do They Know It's Christmas?
She is also fast approaching seven million followers on YouTube, not to mention her two million Twitter followers and 3.5 million followers on Instagram.
