The 31-year-old Hertha Berlin player lost his father Antoine to a heart attack two weeks ago and is now also mourning the loss of his aunt Fernande.
He will fly home to spend time with his family during the international break.
Ivory Coast need only a draw with Sierra Leone on 3 September to qualify for the 2017 finals in Gabon.
"I'm travelling home to support my family," Kalou told German daily Bild.
"Of course, I am unbelievably sad and feel empty," he added, talking about the death of his father, after Hertha's 5-3 penalty shoot-out win at Jahn Regensburg in the first round of the German Cup last Sunday.
"Football is a therapy for me at the moment. It will take a while to get over this."
After this weekend's opening round of Bundesliga matches, Berlin's next German league game is on 10 September at Ingolstadt, but no date has been fixed for Kalou's return.
Kalou was Berlin's top scorer last season with 14 goals in 32 league games.
