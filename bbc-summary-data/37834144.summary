[SN]TITLE[SN]
Joe Gormley: Peterborough United striker, on loan at St Johnstone, quits pro football

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Peterborough United striker Joe Gormley, who was on loan at Scottish Premiership side St Johnstone, has quit professional football at the age of 26.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gormley suffered a serious knee injury after joining Posh in 2015 before moving to Scotland in August.
Posh director of football Barry Fry said Gormley was "disillusioned with football" and has now returned to his native Northern Ireland.
Fry added that Gormley was seeking to return to part-time football.
He joined Posh having twice broken the record for number of goals scored by a Cliftonville player in one season.
But the Northern Irishman did not score after moving into the full-time game.
Fry said that Peterborough, St Johnstone and Gormley have all written letters to Fifa for special dispensation to cancel his contract by mutual consent outside the January window.
