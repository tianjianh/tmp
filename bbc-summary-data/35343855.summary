The four-storey centre in Fleming Way is expected to be completed by spring 2017.
It will house two GP practices, a dentist, pharmacy, and a variety of community health services to replace the outdated health centre in Carfax Street.
The NHS-funded centre will serve an estimated 22,000 registered and 36,000 unregistered patients once complete.
Bob Sanderson, director of urgent care at Carfax Street Health Centre, said he was "delighted" work had started on the new centre.
"It will improve the health and wellbeing of people in Swindon by providing a modern, safe and high-quality environment." he said.
"Local patients will be able to access two GP practices, community and dental services, specialist health services and a pharmacy - all under one town centre roof."
John Follows, from NHS Property Services, said the development was "hugely important to local people".
"This is an excellent facility to meet the changing needs of patients and the NHS for many years to come," he said.
The new health centre will sit alongside the already constructed new 850-space multi-storey car park and assisted living residential building, as part of a £350m redevelopment of the town centre.
