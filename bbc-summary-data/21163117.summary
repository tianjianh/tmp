What If? Visions of the future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
This year the BBC is looking into the future, finding out what it holds for health, education, transport and even love. The season is called What If? and we asked you to send us your visions of the future. Hundreds of you did, the competition is now closed and we will be announcing the winners on March 25th.

We also asked six artists from around the world to share their vision with us. Now we want you to do the same.
Illustrator and film-maker Koji Yamamura is renowned as one of the greatest animators in Japan today and one of the best-known in the world. His animated short Mt Head was nominated for an Oscar in 2003. He has won many international prizes, and has been the subject of retrospectives and exhibitions in more than 20 countries.
"When I was thinking about the illustration I came up with the Tower of Babel's story and instantly the painting The Tower of Babel by Pieter Bruegel came to my mind. Then I thought, 'Why don't I draw a future version of it?'"
Play Collective is an award-winning animation and design collective based in Buenos Aires that has worked with international advertising agencies and has produced films for TV channels around the world.
"There are a lot of apocalyptic scenarios about the future but we believe that giving an optimistic message is a way of building a happier world," director Agustin Orol says.
Glenn Hatton from Melbourne, Australia, is - at 26 - our youngest artist and has already made his mark in TV, short films, music videos and apps.
"My animation takes a global perspective, showing three cities from around the world. Remnants of the past sit alongside modern sustainable architecture and an expanding natural environment. As we pan around the globe, we see that even though landscape and language may change, we are alike in our social environments and patterns."
The British artist and author Levi Pinfold, best known for his children's books, was voted Best Emerging Illustrator in the UK Early Years Awards in 2010 and won the UK Booktrust's Best New Illustrators Award in 2011.
"I've picked a landscape to reflect my own concerns about the future, an arid, waterless environment, a tough place where life is difficult to sustain. This painting is intended to be taken as a surreal image, a dream that contains the possibility of turning into a nightmare at any point".
Abdoulaye Konat√© is the award-winning director of the Conservatoire of Arts and Media in Bamako, Mali, and has worked as a graphic designer at the National Museum of Bamako. He has exhibited at the Hayward Gallery in London, The Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, Mori Art Museum in Tokyo and Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany.
"My work is essentially based on my vision of the landscape, using a technique inspired by the costumes worn by Senufo musicians. They often have strips of fabric attached to their outfits. I said to myself that the future of the world will depend on the attitude mankind decides to adopt.  Above all what's needed is total respect for the environment."
In his native Spain, Chema Madoz is called "the poet photographer". His black-and-white pictures show a different side of everyday objects, another perspective of what is around us.
He was the first living Spanish photographer to be the subject of a retrospective at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid.
His photograph is his vision of how the world might end up 50 years in the future.  Madoz focused on the fact that natural resources, especially water, are running out.
"I wanted to play with the concept of limits: an empty glass and the text that always appears at the end of the movies: THE END".
