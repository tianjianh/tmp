The unprovoked attack happened in Elm Row at about 00:30 on Friday.
A 21-year-old had just passed the Jeremiah's Taproom pub when he was assaulted.
The men hit him in the face, cutting his lip and causing him to fall to the ground before they walked off down Montgomery Street.
Det Con Iain Wallace, of Police Scotland, said: "This appears to be a random assault which resulted in the victim, who did not know his attackers, sustaining a painful injury to his mouth.
"We are keen to hear from anyone who remembers seeing any suspicious activity on Elm Row during the time of this incident and would ask those with information to contact police immediately.
"In particular, we are eager to hear from a group of people who entered the street from a nearby common stair while the assault was taking place.
"These individuals may have seen something that can help our investigation and I would ask them to get in touch with us."
