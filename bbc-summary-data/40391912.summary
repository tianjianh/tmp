James Brindley, 26, who had spent the evening with friends, died at the scene on High Street, Aldridge, just before midnight on Friday, police said.
Det Insp Jim Munro said a murder investigation was under way. A cordon remains in place.
"A young man has lost his life in brutal circumstances and someone will have knowledge of who has done this," the officer said.
West Midlands Police officers are looking at CCTV footage from the surrounding area to try to establish what happened.
Mr Munro said officers had spoken to several people but were "still asking people to come forward to help us piece together what happened and the motive behind the attack".
"James' family are understandably distraught at his loss and our thoughts remain with them," he said.
Mr Brindley was described by his family as "a very straightforward and trusting person".
"Outwardly James appeared to be a Jack the lad, without a care in the world, but that belied his true nature which was deeply sensitive and fiercely loyal to his family and friends," they said in a statement.
A post-mortem examination is taking place.
