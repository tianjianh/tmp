The 27-year-old former Scotland forward has yet to score for the Pilgrims this season, but set up Craig Tanner's goal in their 1-0 win at Accrington Stanley to keep the club top of League Two.
"He's a top player and probably too good for this division," said Adams.
"We're lucky to have him, but he hasn't had the break at this moment in time to get him the goal that he deserves."
The Argyle boss continued: "He's hit the bar a few times, he's had blocks on the goal, and his movement is very good."
Goodwillie, who was signed by Blackburn for Â£2m in 2011, agreed a one-year contract at Home Park in the summer.
He last scored for Ross County in May, while on loan from Aberdeen, for whom he found the net eight times in two seasons.
