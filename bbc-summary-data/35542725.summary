Premier League predictions: Lawro v Deadpool star Ed Skrein

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League games is actor Ed Skrein, star of Game of Thrones and new superhero movie Deadpool.
Skrein is a Liverpool fan and told BBC Sport: "I should support Arsenal because I grew up in north London but my auntie and my cousins are to blame for me picking Liverpool instead in about 1987.

"I grew up through the golden years for Arsenal and Manchester United under Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson, which was tough, but I love my team when they're losing as well as when they're winning.
"I am very excited about Jurgen Klopp being Liverpool manager. When he was appointed I spoke to my brother and said 'this is something that is going to be this romantic whirlwind'. It feels like it is all going to end in tears but we will enjoy every minute of it."
You can hear more of Ed's tales of following the Reds on the BBC Sport website.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got six correct results from 10 matches, including two perfect scores.
His score of 120 points saw him beat Dad's Army stars Blake Harrison and Daniel Mays, who picked three correct results but no perfect scores for a total of 30.
