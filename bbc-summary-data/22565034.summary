American singer-songwriter John Grant had just finished playing at St George's church in Kemp Town on Thursday when the computer was taken.
He wrote on Facebook: "I am shocked and just completely speechless."
One band member, drummer Kristinn Agnarsson, tweeted that one of the crew had "looked away for a bit, and then it was gone".
Sussex Police said the theft had been reported just after midnight and the laptop had not been returned or found.
Mr Grant said: "After our show in Brighton tonight, someone who was apparently in the audience stole my computer off the stage, which has my entire life on it.
"I have so many things on that computer which I need."
