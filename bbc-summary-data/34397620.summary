[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dieudonne evicted from Paris theatre over lease and insurance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been ordered to vacate the Paris theatre where he has been performing for the last 15 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A court granted an eviction order to the theatre's owners on technical grounds.
The comedian can stay there pending an appeal.
Dieudonne has several convictions for anti-Semitism, hate speech and glorifying terrorism.
His most recent was after the Islamist attack in January on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
The theatre's owners said his current theatre company had no right to the lease, which had been made out to the previous incarnation of the company.
Several French cities have banned the comedian from performing.
He rose to prominence through the invention of the "quenelle", a hand gesture critics have likened to an inverted Nazi salute. He insists he is not anti-Semitic.
