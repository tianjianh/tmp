[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hatfield Colliery wound up at the High Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The company that ran Hatfield Colliery has been wound up at the High Court, bringing to an end almost a century of mining at the pit near Doncaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hatfield Colliery, which has been run by an employee-owned trust since 2013, closed in June with the loss of 430 jobs.
The last piece of coal mined at the pit was given to the Mayor of Doncaster.
Announcing the closure, a colliery spokesman said there was no longer a market for the coal.
The Hatfield Main Colliery Community Heritage Association has called for the mine head structures to be preserved as a "monument" to the area's long mining history.
Mining historian Brian Elliott said: "It's the end of deep mining in real terms in the country as a whole."
The only remaining deep coal mine in England, Kellingley colliery in North Yorkshire, is due to close later this year.
