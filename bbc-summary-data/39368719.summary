The centre, 24, came through Sale's academy and was the youngest player to sign a professional deal with the Sharks aged 16.
Jennings, who has represented England youth level, has made six Premiership appearances for Sale this season.
"He has stayed loyal to the club since joining and he will play a big part in what we are building at the club," Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond said.
Jennings becomes the 13th player to recently sign a new contract at 10th-placed Sale, with George Nott and brothers Ben and Tom Curry also committing their futures to the club this month.
His new deal also follows the returns of Will Cliff and Marc Jones from Bristol and the signing of Scotland international Josh Strauss from Glasgow.
