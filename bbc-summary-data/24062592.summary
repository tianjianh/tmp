Labour MPs in London have signed a Commons motion calling for transport fares in the capital to be frozen at the rate of inflation for 2014.

The motion signed by 24 MPs said fares in London are "the most expensive in the world" and since 2008 the cost of a single bus journey has jumped by 50%.
It comes as passengers saw on average a 4.2% increase in fares this January, across the Tube, buses and trams.
The mayor's office says "every penny" from fares is invested in improvements.
The motion, which is led by Eltham MP Clive Efford, said: "London commuter fares have become the most expensive in the world and are an ever increasing pressure on Londoners' household budgets while real wages are falling and bills are rising."
A zone one to six travel card is now Â£400 more expensive, the MPs note, in addition to a 56% rise in bus fares over the last five years.
The MPs also urged "the Mayor of London to use his discretion to freeze fares at RPI for 2014, easing the pressure on ordinary Londoners during the current cost of living crisis".
A spokesperson for mayor Boris Johnson, said: "Every penny from fares is invested in improving transport for Londoners, resulting in one of the biggest and most reliable transport systems in the world.
"He (the mayor) will make a decision on fares for 2014 later this year but has publicly stated that he is determined to bear down on them as much as possible."
