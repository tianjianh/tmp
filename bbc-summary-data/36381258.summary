Plans for a Â£200m private railway to improve transport links between Windsor and London have been unveiled.

Windsor Link Railway's "master plan" includes the regeneration of the riverside and the creation of a tunnel to allow through trains from Slough to join the Waterloo line.
WLR said the track would be the "first privately funded addition to the core network for over 100 years".
Network Rail received plans for the scheme in 2013.
Proposals also include the development of new homes and office buildings as well as creating a direct line from Windsor to Paddington and Heathrow Airport.
The company was set up in 2009 by businessman George Bathurst with the aim of working with public and private sector bodies to "improving the environment, increasing social mobility and creating economic growth and employment".
It aims to develop existing riverside car park areas for homes in order to finance a wider rail and regeneration project.
Mr Bathurst said the construction of the tunnel would take less than a year if given the go-ahead.
"We're delighted to be presenting these plans to the public.  It's important to remember that they are only ideas for discussion at this stage so we welcome comments and suggestions which will be fed into future workshops as the designs are developed in partnership with local people and businesses."
Public consultations on more detailed aspects of the plans are due to begin later this year.
