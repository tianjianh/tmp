The boat overturned off the coast of Beer Ali, in the southern Shabwa province, the ministry of defence said on its news website.
A Yemeni naval patrol saved at least 30 people who were taken to a refugee camp in the town of Mayfaa, it said.
Every year thousands of Africans make the perilous journey to Yemen in crowded boats. Hundreds have died.
