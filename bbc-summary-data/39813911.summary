Plaid Cymru gains on Anglesey but fails to win majority

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru increased its majority on Anglesey but fell short of a majority with the council remaining with no party in overall control.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party gained two seats, overtaking the independents to become the largest group on the island's authority, with 14 seats.
Meanwhile in Gwynedd, Plaid held its majority, with 41 seats, Llais Gwynedd won six and independents got 26. Labour and Liberal Democrats had one each.
Conwy remains in no overall control.
Independents took 20 seats, Conservatives 16, Plaid Cymru 10, Labour eight and Lib Dems four, while one seat went to a candidate with no named party.
Turnout on Anglesey was 45.9%, down from 51% in the previous local election.
In Gwynedd, lots had to be drawn after a dead heat between Plaid Cymru's John Wynn Jones and an independent candidate Richard Medwyn Hughes for the Hendre ward seat.
The council's chief executive Dilwyn Williams drew the lot - and Richard Medwyn Hughes was duly elected councillor for Hendre.
In Conwy, actor and TV presenter James Lusted was voted in as a Conservative Councillor for Rhos-on-Sea.
Mr Lusted, who has dwarfism and is 3ft 7in, featured in a 2014 BBC Wales programme called Real Families: Born Small, which looked at his condition and his life.
