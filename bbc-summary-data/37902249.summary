Wockhardt, which supplies the NHS with medicines such as insulin, is building a sterile manufacturing and testing facility at its site at Wrexham Industrial Estate.
The Indian company currently employs 380 people in Wrexham.
The announcement comes as Prime Minister Theresa May is on a trade mission to India with UK bosses.
She said: "For the near 400 people who work in the Wrexham manufacturing plant, and indeed the whole town, today's announcement is a huge vote of confidence in the workers and the local economy.
"But I want to see much more investment in Wales.
"And that's why I was so pleased to welcome two Welsh firms to my delegation for the trade trip to India, where they have been able to forge contacts and relationships with the investors of the future."
Wockhardt UK managing director Sirjiwan Singh said the investment "will ensure the global competitiveness of our operations and future manufacturing plans at Wrexham".
