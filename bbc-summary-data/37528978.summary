Officers were called to Sainsbury's on Darwen Road at about 10:25 BST on Friday after a "significant" amount of money was stolen.
Two men attacked the pair with a crowbar and a sledgehammer, Greater Manchester Police said.
They escaped in an Audi A3 car driven by a third man. It was found burnt out in a nearby backstreet.
One of the victims has a broken arm and the other was knocked unconscious and has a suspected broken jaw. The men continued to assault the drivers even after taking the money, police added.
Det Insp Matthew Bailey-Smith said: "This was a planned and extremely nasty attack which has culminated in a sustained, armed assault on two men.
"Both were taken to hospital after a terrifying and traumatic ordeal which has also resulted in a significant amount of cash being stolen."
