Rochdale boss Keith Hill has accused his side of having a "losing mentality" after being beaten by Shrewsbury.

Dale lost 1-0 to the relegation-threatened Shrews, leaving them ninth in League One, six points adrift of the play-offs with four games left.
Hill's team have now won just five of their 20 away games this season, compared to 12 of 19 at Spotland.
"The players have got to prove to me and the supporters that they can do it away from home," he said.
He continued to BBC Radio Manchester: "I'm dealing with players that, characteristically, support a losing mentality - especially away from home."
With the defeat effectively ending Dale's hopes of reaching the play-offs, Hill criticised his players for their approach to the match and called for improvement against Bury on Thursday evening.
"We've got four games left, players out of contract at the end of the season and we're going into a game against Bury where there's local bragging rights," he said.
"Players have got to come to me and say 'I want to play because I want to give everything. I'm not waiting until next season.' But unfortunately at this time I've got too many waiters.
"I've supported a lot of players in renewing contracts. They're playing for their futures, definitely, but I'm managing for my future. I don't want a sterile environment, I want a winning environment."
