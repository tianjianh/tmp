The Olympic champion, 26, was involved in a collision late on stage three, which was won by Julian Alaphilippe.
Briton Kennaugh, who won team pursuit gold at the 2012 Games in London, could now miss the Tour de France, which begins on 2 July in Mont-Saint-Michel.
Team Sky sport director Gabriel Rasch said the crash came at "the worst possible time" for the team.
