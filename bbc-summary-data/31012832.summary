It is believed flammable material was thrown through the front window of Michelle Mulherin's office in Ballina shortly after 19:00 GMT on Tuesday.
The office sustained minimal smoke damage as a result of the blaze.
The street has been closed to traffic and an examination is being carried out in the building.
In a statement, Ms Mulherin said she was thankful that no-one had been injured.
"I await the outcome of the garda investigation and will be making no further comment at this stage," she said.
