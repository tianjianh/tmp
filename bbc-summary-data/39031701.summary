The 24-year-old, who has signed a two-year-contract, had been linked with Ospreys having fallen out of favour at the Blues.
Allen has won four caps for Wales and scored a hat-trick in his last appearance for his country, against Uruguay at the 2015 World Cup.
Meanwhile, Ospreys centre Josh Matavesi will join Newcastle for next season.
Allen had been overtaken by the likes of New Zealanders Rey Lee-Lo and Willis Halaholo in the Blues pecking order, while Leicester's Welsh centre Jack Roberts will move to the Arms Park in the summer.
With Matavesi leaving Ospreys, Allen will compete against players such as Ashley Beck, Ben John, Kieron Fonotia, Owen Watkin and the returning James Hook for a starting place at the Liberty Stadium.
"Along with Hooky, also arriving in the summer, we have two fresh options who will really increase competition in the squad," said Ospreys head coach Steve Tandy.
"It's going to be a really positive to have Cory around, he's got some real qualities that will help us develop our game, while we will be good for him.
"It's a fresh start for Cory. Our track record for developing players speaks for itself, not just home grown youth but under the radar players coming to us from other regions, people like Dan Evans and Sam Parry who have really grown in our environment, and this has undoubtedly played a part in his decision to join us."
