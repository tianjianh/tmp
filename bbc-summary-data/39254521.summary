Reading goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi says that "small details" proved costly in their 3-0 away defeat by Preston.

It was the Royals' third successive loss on the road but they stay fifth in the Championship, with a four-point cushion inside the play-off places.
"When you see the first two goals, I think they're easy goals to concede," Al Habsi told BBC Radio Berkshire.
"At this stage of the season, you need to be more focused and make fewer mistakes."
Reading travel to sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday on Friday with the Owls just two points behind them in the table.
The Royals have now lost nine times away from home which is in stark contrast to their fortunes at the Madjeski Stadium, where they have been beaten just twice.
"We need to work this out," Al Habsi said. "In some games away, the performance is good, but the small detail, or a mistake, is what costs us the game.
"It's going to be a massive game for us at Hillsborough - and for them. We need to be focused and ready for it."
