It has been watched more than 8 million times on Channel 4 and Buzzfeed's Facebook pages, with hundreds of thousands of views on newspaper sites, YouTube and the SNP's own site. On the BBC the story has been viewed 150,000 times.
SNP Westminster Leader Angus Robertson said: "Mhairi's outstanding maiden speech was principled and passionate. She is without a doubt a huge credit to Paisley and to the SNP.
"The House of Commons listened in silence to its youngest member remind us all why we are sitting in our place and those we were elected to speak for - it is of no surprise that this message had resonance far beyond the walls of Westminster.
"That millions of people across the UK and abroad watched her speech is staggering."
