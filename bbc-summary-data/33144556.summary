[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the murder of Paul McCauley have said they have examined "vital" information contained in a sympathy card sent to his father.

Mr McCauley died earlier this month, nine years after being severely beaten in a sectarian attack in Londonderry.
Jim McCauley said the letter he received may add "another facet" to the investigation into his son's murder.
Det Ch Insp Michael Harvey appealed to the person who wrote the card to contact police to assist their inquiry.
"I would specifically like to ask one person, who wrote to Mr Jim McCauley expressing their sympathy and disgust at the attack on Paul, to please contact the detectives at Maydown, as I believe they hold vital information in relation to this investigation," he said.
Mr McCauley was 29 years old when he was beaten by a loyalist gang at a barbecue in the Waterside nine years ago.
He was left in a persistent vegetative state until his death in a care home on 6 June.
It is believed the attack was carried out by a gang of up to fifteen people.
Jim McCauley told BBC Radio Foyle's Breakfast programme that the letter was one of hundreds the family had received after his son's death.
"[It] is of interest because there is a feeling [from] this very kind letter that there may be further information from the individual that sent it," he said.
"There may be another facet to the investigation that this individual may be aware of.
"The letters are not anonymous but [this is] a request to that individual to maybe speak to Det Ch Insp Michael Harvey or come back to me or any member of the family, and hopefully we can make contact again."
He added that he had been disappointed that people he said he knew were holding crucial information had not cooperated with the police inquiry.
"I find that in a crime so horrendous the silence in both communities is appalling, and a sad reflection being tolerated by the good people within those communities that they cannot lever the truth out from those who are basically holding them to ransom," he said.
Mr McCauley said he and his wife Cathy felt "a tranquillity" with the passing of their son.
"There is a mixture of emotions. There is the sadness, the loss, the miss of the person, but also, in Paul's case because he had suffered so much, there is a contentment that he has passed to a better place," he said.
The PSNI has said "upwards of 15 detectives" are working on the inquiry into Mr McCauley's murder.
While Mr McCauley said he had been unhappy with the first investigation into his son's death, he said the second inquiry has done "an awful lot of groundwork".
He added: "I'm quite definite that we will see justice in that the core that attacked Paul will be brought to book."
"These people are not anonymous, they've not ridden into the night after the extremely cowardly and bullying attack."
On Tuesday's Spotlight programme on BBC One NI at 22:35 BST, Enda McClafferty reports on the death of Paul McCauley.
