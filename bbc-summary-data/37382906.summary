Olivier Award-nominated actress Amy Lennox has joined the cast of David Bowie's musical Lazarus as it moves from New York to London.

Lennox's role in the stage version of Kinky Boots earned her an Olivier nomination for best supporting actress in a musical earlier this year.
Lazarus will run at Kings Cross Theatre from 25 October to 22 January 2017.
Bowie co-wrote the show with Irish playwright Enda Walsh, the award-winning writer of Once.
Inspired by the book The Man Who Fell To Earth, the show premiered last November at New York Theatre Workshop, just a few weeks before Bowie's death.
Most of the main cast have come from New York to London, but Amy Lennox will replace Cristin Milioti as Elly.
Elly is the assistant to Newton, the human-looking alien played by Bowie in the 1976 film The Man Who Fell To Earth and now played on stage by Michael C Hall.
Other new additions to the London cast include Jamie Muscato, Gabrielle Brooks, Sydnie Christmas, Richard Hansell, Maimuna Memon, Tom Parsons and Julie Yammanee.
When it opened in New York, The Guardian described Lazarus as "unapologetically weird... and oddly intriguing".
Rolling Stone praised the show as a "surrealistic tour de force."
