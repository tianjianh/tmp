The 15-year-old boy was issued with a summons after police were alerted to activity on Twitter over the weekend.
South Yorkshire Police said the youngster, from West Yorkshire, was due in court at a later date over an offence of malicious communications.
Details of the performer have not been released for "safety" reasons.
Ch Insp Lydia Lynskey said: "We will always investigate any incident reported to us, and I would urge people to please consider what they post on social media, as while it may only be meant in jest, it could cause serious distress or alarm."
