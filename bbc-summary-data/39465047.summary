[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 0-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Christian Doidge was on the scoresheet again to fire National League promotion-chasers Forest Green to victory at Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Doidge consolidated his position as the division's second-top scorer as he looped in a header for his 24th goal of the season. Dan Wishart had flicked on Charlie Cooper's deep cross to set up the possibility after 26 minutes.
Guiseley's task was complicated in the 54th minute when Jake Cassidy was sent off following a challenge on Mark Ellis.
It should have signalled Forest Green's ascendancy, but the home side dug in, albeit on the back foot, to keep the visitors sweating on victory.
