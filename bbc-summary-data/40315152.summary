It happened about 15:30 BST on Saturday near Waterfoot in County Antrim.
A member of the public spotted the men in the water shouting for help and raised the alarm.
The RNLI Red Bay Lifeboat crew brought them onto the lifeboat and safely ashore. The crew treated them at the scene.
It is understood the men were from Belfast and were visiting the area for the day.
RNLI Red Bay Lifeboat Helm Paddy McLaughlin urged those enjoying the sunny weather on the water to be careful.
"These men were very lucky their calls for help were heard and that the lifeboat crew were on scene so quickly," he said.
"We would advise everyone enjoying the water during the warm weather to take all necessary safety precautions including wearing a suitable flotation device and having a means of calling for help," he added.
