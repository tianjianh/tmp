A man who beat a mother, her two children and their grandmother to death at their home near Swansea 15 years ago has launched a fresh application to get his conviction overturned.

David Morris was jailed for life for the second time in 2006 for killing Mandy Power and her family in Clydach after a prior conviction was quashed.
The Criminal Case Review Commission confirmed it had received an application from Morris on 14 November.
They will be considering the case soon.
The commission said it was the second application from Morris. The first, in December 2008, was not referred to the Court of Appeal.
Morris, who was 44 when he was sentenced in August 2006, was told by the trial judge life should mean life, and he should never be released.
Ms Power, 34, died along with her daughters Katie, 10, and Emily, eight, and their disabled grandmother Doris Dawson.
On Sunday, the Mail on Sunday reported that fresh evidence had emerged which was not heard at Morris's trial after a journalism lecturer took up the case.
Morris' trial heard he had a sexual relationship with Ms Power and was fuelled by drink and drugs when he went on a killing spree in June 1999.
Mrs Dawson, who was 80, was killed as she lay helpless in her bed, and the killer laid in wait for the others to return home.
Ms Power and her daughters were battered repeatedly with a fibreglass pole which the children used to play with, and Ms Power's body was sexually assaulted.
The scene was described as "carnage" in court, with the judge adding: "Words cannot convey the severity of the injuries inflicted upon them."
The killer lit fires around the house in an attempt to hide the crimes. Firefighters found the bodies of Ms Power and the girls laid out on the landing when they came to tackle the blaze.
Before Morris was arrested, suspicion had fallen on Ms Power's secret lover Alison Lewis, a former South Wales Police officer, and her husband Stephen Lewis, a serving officer.
They were arrested but never charged.
