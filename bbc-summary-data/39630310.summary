Ben Turner: Burton Albion appeal against defender's racial abuse charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion are to appeal against a Football Association charge of racial abuse handed to defender Ben Turner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An independent panel last month found Turner, 28, guilty after an incident involving Brentford's Nico Yennaris.
He was banned him for five matches but, having reviewed the written reasons, Burton have elected to challenge the verdict.
"Everybody is still incredibly disappointed with the commission's decision," boss Nigel Clough said.
The charge related to the Brewers game against Brentford on 10 December, when he was one of four players booked in the same injury-time incident, which also involved his team-mate Jon McLaughlin and Brentford pair Romaine Sawyers and Yennaris.
Turner was found guilty of an "aggravated breach" of FA regulations as his language "included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality".
He has been available while Burton pondered an appeal and will continue to be free to play until it is heard.
Burton Albion have until 22 April to lodge the formal grounds for the appeal.
