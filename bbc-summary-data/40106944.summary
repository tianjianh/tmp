Stanley Tucci will introduce the UK premiere of his film, Final Portrait, while Oliver Stone will introduce a special screening of his film, Wall Street, 30 years after it was made.
The festival is celebrating its 70th anniversary.
The Edinburgh International Film Festival started in 1947.
Ken Hay, CEO of Edinburgh International Film Festival, said: "EIFF is hugely grateful to all its funders, partners, major donors and supporters for sharing our vision and ambition and being so generous with their support. Quite simply, without it, there would be no festival. So, thank you."
Mark Adams, Artistic Director of Edinburgh International Film Festival said: "The amazing support we receive really does mean so much to the festival and helps us reach even greater heights in terms ambition and presentation of exciting new projects."
