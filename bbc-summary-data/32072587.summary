Bronze Age rings found in Rossett, Wrexham, declared treasure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Bronze Age gold rings which were found by a metal detectorist on farm land in Wrexham have been declared treasure by a coroner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lock-rings - worn either as earrings or in the hair by a person of wealth and status about 3,000 years ago - were discovered in Rossett.
The ornaments will now go on display in Wrexham County Borough Museum.
It is thought the prized rings were buried as gifts to the gods, perhaps at the end of their owners' lives.
In Wales, lock-rings have previously been found at Gaerwen, Anglesey, the Great Orme, Conwy and Newport in Pembrokeshire.
National Museum Wales said the largely coastal pattern hinted at possible trading and communication links between late Bronze Age communities living in Wales and Ireland.
They were declared to be treasure by the coroner for north east Wales.
