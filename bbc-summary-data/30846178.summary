Former Hanworth children's home manager accused of sex abuse found dead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former children's home manager who was due to face trial for sex abuse charges has been found dead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Stingemore, 72, was found at his home in Stonehouse Drive, St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, on Wednesday.
Mr Stingemore was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown court over 12 charges, which included indecent assault. He had denied the charges.
Seven youngsters were allegedly abused at Grafton Close Children's Home in Hanworth in the 1970s and 1980s.
Mr Stingemore had previously suffered a number of strokes and police were called to his home after concerns about his health.
Officers found him collapsed at the property and he was declared dead at the scene.
Sussex Police said his death was not suspicious. A post-mortem examination has yet to take place.
His co-defendant Father Tony McSweeney, 66, of Pease Pottage, West Sussex, pleaded not guilty to similar charges in November. Fr McSweeney was a Catholic priest in Norfolk.
Both men were due to stand trial on 2 February.
