Stormont officials are working to prepare for the arrival of Syrian refugees in Northern Ireland, Acting First Minister Arlene Foster has said.

A strategic planning group will advise ministers on their responsibilities, she said.
Practical steps to meet immediate and longer term needs will be considered by an operational planning group.
Prime Minister David Cameron has said the UK will accept up to 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.
The UK has accepted more than 200 refugees from Syria under the Vulnerable Persons Relocation scheme (VPRS) since it began in January 2014.
However, Mrs Foster told First Minister's Questions on Monday that details of how the scheme would operate in Northern Ireland had not yet been finalised.
The strategic planning group is being led by the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister, while the operational planning group is part of the Department for Social Development (DSD)
Northern Ireland's 11 councils have already been contacted by the DSD operational planning group to outline how the scheme might work and what role local government might play.
In a letter to councils issued earlier this month, a DSD official said it was envisaged that groups of between 25 and 100 people would arrive, at least six to eight weeks apart, "on a phased basis over a number of years".
20,000
more refugees will be resettled in the UK by 2020
4,980
Syrian asylum seekers have been allowed to stay since 2011
25,771 people applied for asylum in the UK in the year to end June 2015
2,204 were from Syria
87% of Syrian requests for asylum were granted
145 Syrian asylum seekers have been removed from the UK since 2011
"Initial thoughts are that the most appropriate settlement pattern may be to bring groups of 10 to 15 refugee households to an area," said an DSD official.
"This size of group would be large enough to allow the refugees to form informal support networks with people who share a cultural background and language, but not so large that local communities feel overwhelmed."
The official said that on arrival, refugees might be brought to a reception centre for a short period before being settled into permanent accommodation.
He said the operational planning group had begun work to identify suitable locations, "taking into account the availability of housing and capacity in key public services such as education and health".
