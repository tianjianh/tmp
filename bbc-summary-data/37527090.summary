[SN]TITLE[SN]
Colchester United 0-0 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Caretaker Sean McCarthy saw bottom-of-the-table Newport claim a point at Colchester in his last game before new manager Graham Westley takes over.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's, without a win in five games, drop to 12th place after a game low on chances and quality.
Newport striker Jon Parkin forced a good save out of Sam Walker before the interval and Jordan Green went close in the second half.
The final whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos by the Colchester fans.
Newport caretaker boss Sean McCarthy told BBC Radio Wales: "We'd have liked to have gone out with three points obviously, but a clean sheet never loses you a match. It's a point away from home and it's a good point.
"They've defended well today and they've got their reward. They've got a point from it. We'd have liked three, we don't want to be where we are in the table at the moment."
