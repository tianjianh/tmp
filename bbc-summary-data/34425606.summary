[SN]TITLE[SN]
£2m sports complex planned for Thurso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sports complex could be built in Thurso with support from Cavendish Nuclear, the parent company at the nearby Dounreay power station.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed £2m development has been earmarked for the site of the demolished Dounreay Sports and Social Club.
The power station is also in the process of being knocked down.
A four-lane running track and indoor sports hall equivalent in size to four badminton courts has been proposed.
Subject to planning permission and successful funding applications, the sports complex could be open by the end of 2016.
It would form part of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy programme.
