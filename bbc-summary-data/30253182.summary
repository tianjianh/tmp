Previously, the Sound Of poll has been topped by Adele, Sam Smith and Jessie J.
This year, 13 of the 15 acts are from the UK, with a mix of hip-hop, folk, punk, electro-pop featuring on the list.
The three artists who have made the Brits Critics' Choice shortlist, James Bay, Years and Years and George The Poet have all made The Sound of 2015.
Other names on the list include Rae Morris, who headlined the BBC's Introducing stage at this year's Reading and Leeds festivals.
While they are all deemed to have the right musical credentials, we decided to find out a bit more about some of them.
So we trawled the internet, particularly their social media accounts, to find out who these people really are.
We've selected the best the internet could offer.
Years and Years are a London-based electro-pop trio who have already played numerous festivals this year.
They've also supported Clean Bandit and Sam Smith on tour - not bad.
Ellie Goulding is a big fan of frontman Olly Alexander's voice but he has another talent.
This guy can act too.
He has most recently appeared in The Riot Club with Douglas Booth, Sam Claflin and Max Irons, although didn't feature in our who's hottest video.
Olly has also starred in Great Expectations and Gulliver's Travels.
Shamir is an American singer-songwriter from north Vegas, Nevada.
According to an interview with US Vogue, he had a love for Soul and R&B, but experimented with punk for a while.
He formed a two-piece, a bit like The White Stripes, he was on guitar and a friend on drums. He says they sounded great but she froze on stage so it was a short-lived.
Enough of that though, because, best of all - he loves taxidermy and here's the proof.
Wolf Alice are an alternative rock four-piece from north London, three guys, one girl.
They released their debut EP Blush in October 2013, have appeared on Radio 1's Huw Stephens show and singer Ellie Rowsell has already featured on the front cover of the NME.
But when searching through their social media accounts, this stood out in particular.
We're not sure if band member, Joff Oddie, is related to Bill Oddie although he does have an uncle called Bill, according to the Lancashire Telegraph.
That is an aside because Joff can talk to cows.
Slaves are a garage punk duo from Kent made up of Isaac Holman and Laurie Vincent.
They have a Reading and Leeds Festival Introducing slot under their belt plus a performance on Later... with Jools Holland.
According to an interview with music website  Performance Reviewed - they dislike Davina McCall and Tracy from Coronation Street.
However, according to their Twitter account, they really like one type of mineral water.
Shura is Russian but she was brought up over here and produces hypnotic, synthy pop.
She cites Janet Jackson and Madonna as her influences and doesn't look too dissimilar to Madge in the 1980s in her press shots.
Her musical career is definitely on the up and she has some serious career goals.
Appearing on the soundtrack to the new Jurassic Park film seems to be at the top of that list.
SOAK, aka Bridie Monds-Watson, is an experimental folk singer from Derry and signed to CHVRCHES' label, Goodbye Records.
Her track Blud has already had plays on Radio 1 and 6 Music.
While her star is on the ascent, Soak's twitter bio is also brilliant.
"18 year old Musician. Appreciates Dinosaurs and Dragons. Weirdo. Has funny bottom row crisscross teeth. Probably the same height as a leprechaun."
And guess what? Despite being a super-cool singer-songwriter, she still gets excited about seeing Santa.
This is a British-Australian surf rock group who all met in a bar called Le Surfing in Hossegor in the south of France.
They subsequently named their first EP after the bar and it peaked at number six in the UK iTunes rock chart.
Like most bands, even The Rolling Stones, they started playing covers and they actively encourage crowd-surfing on actual surfboards at their gigs.
There are lots of great surfing pictures on their social media accounts but we like this one the best.
This is their trusty touring van, perfect size to fit equipment and their surfboards.
