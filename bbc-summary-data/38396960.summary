Barker left his role as head of coaching at Stadium MK on Tuesday.
The former Bury, Crawley and Portsmouth boss, 41, had a spell in caretaker charge of the Dons after Robinson left the Buckinghamshire club in October.
"Once Richie became available, I wanted to act to get him," Robinson told the club website.
Meanwhile, Chris O'Loughlin will remain as first-team coach until the end of the season.
The Northern Irishman joined the staff at The Valley shortly before Robinson was appointed on 24 November.
