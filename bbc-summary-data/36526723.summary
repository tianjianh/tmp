French police blamed 150 "well-trained" Russian hooligans for clashes before England played Russia in Marseille.
Six English fans were jailed on Monday for their roles in the disorder and Uefa has threatened to disqualify both teams if there is further violence.
Uefa gave Russia a fine and suspended disqualification for scenes inside the stadium after Saturday's 1-1 draw.
Alexandr Shprygin, head of the Russian Union of Supporters, said 29 fans were being escorted to the airport.
Shprygin claimed they had been held near Cannes and put on a bus, adding they had "violated no laws in France" and were "not involved in the events in Marseille or in the port or at the stadium".
Fellow passenger Sergei Gorbachev told the BBC that some of the fans on the bus had been separated from the rest, with police saying they were to be deported.
Russian supporters from the bus were later transferred to a Marseille police station where the fans were expected to be held overnight.
Thirty-five people have been injured - most of them England fans - while a total of 20 people were arrested after three days of disorder in Marseille.
Football Association chairman Greg Dyke expressed "serious concerns" about security in Lille, where England fans and Russian supporters are set to gather over the next three days.
Russia play Slovakia in the city on Wednesday, while England fans are expected to gather there ahead of Thursday's Group B match against Wales in the nearby town of Lens.
French authorities have already pledged to increase security in Lens, deploying 2,400 police, gendarmes, security guards and a riot squad.
Drinking alcohol in the streets has also been banned.
Up to 50,000 England fans are expected in Lens despite the fact that the 35,000-capacity stadium has already sold out.

Dr Joel Rookwood, a senior lecturer in football business at Southampton Solent, says Russian hooligans will "prioritise fighting the English rather than watching their own team play".
"For these very violent hooligans, it is a sport," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "The battle for them is more significantly won off the pitch. They're very well organised and ruthlessly effective. They don't seem to fear the police."
Five England fans have been jailed for throwing bottles at police, while a sixth was jailed in connection with the violence.
Two Russians were arrested for invading the pitch.
The Kremlin said "riots" involving Russian fans were "absolutely unacceptable".
