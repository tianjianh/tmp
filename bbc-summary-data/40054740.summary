The Ivory Coast international has made 258 appearances over two spells with the Eagles, scoring 34 goals.
Zaha, 24, told the club website: "Palace is in my heart and I don't think the story is over."
He left Palace to join Manchester United in 2013 for an initial Â£10m and rejoined them in 2015 after two loan spells back in south London.
Eagles chairman Steve Parish added: "Wilf has been with the club since he was eight years old and in the first team from the day I arrived. He is our talisman and someone that week in week out gives everything."
