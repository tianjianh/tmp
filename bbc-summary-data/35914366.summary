Sheffield Wednesday bolstered their Championship play-off hopes with victory against 10-man Blackburn.

Blackburn took the lead in a hectic opening few minutes of the second half when Darragh Lenihan crossed for Craig Conway to dive and head home.
Wednesday levelled when Ross Wallace's cross deflected off Adam Henley before Conway saw red for fouling Alex Lopez.
The hosts took the lead soon after when Fernando Forestieri played in to the unmarked Wallace who volleyed home.
The result was Sheffield Wednesday's fourth consecutive victory in the Championship and keeps them in fifth place in the table, five points ahead of seventh-placed Cardiff in the race for the play-offs.
Conway's goal was the first time the Owls have conceded in four matches, but the hosts fought back with Wallace playing a part in both of their goals.
Blackburn, who let a 1-0 lead slip and had a man sent off for the second match in a row after Shane Duffy was dismissed during Saturday's 2-1 home defeat by Preston, fall a place to 16th in the table following the loss.
