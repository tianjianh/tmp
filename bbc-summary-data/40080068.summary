Lancashire came from behind to score 19 unanswered second-half points and beat Cornwall in the County Championship final at Twickenham.

George Jones put Cornwall ahead from a driving maul and Matt Shepherd kicked a penalty to earn an 8-0 half-time lead.
Ten minutes after the break, Anthony Bingham ran from the halfway line to go over and give Lancashire a lifeline.
Tom Burtonwood and Scott Armstrong crossed shortly afterwards to secure Lancashire the title.
Victory meant they have been champions in six of the past nine years, while Cornwall have now been beaten by their opponents in three finals since 2013.
It also denied Cornwall head coach Graham Dawe, a former England international, a third successive County Championship triumph after wins over Cheshire and Lancashire in the past two competitions.
