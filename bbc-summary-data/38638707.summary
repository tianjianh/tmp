From March 6 - 12 BBC News will be looking at ways to cut air pollution.  Solutions from business and technology to legislation and behaviour change.
Throughout the week there will be exclusive reports, examples of where great ideas have worked and discussions with people like you on the issue.
We want YOU to be a part of this project.
If you'd like to take part, tell us what you'd like to see changed to reduce air pollution. Write your solutions on a card and take a photo of yourself holding it.
