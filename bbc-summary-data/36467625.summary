Mariner Street car park, near the train station, will be cleared and replaced with a 725-bedroom student block, complete with nightclub, gym, office space, bars, restaurants and shops.
The 22 storey tower would be the second tallest building in Swansea, next to Meridian Quay.
Construction is expected to start later this year and finish by summer 2018.
A report before Swansea council's planning committee on Tuesday said the tower "will be a bold addition to the city skyline".
The report added there is a growing need for student accommodation in Swansea, with both Swansea University and Trinity Saint David universities expanding in the city.
Swansea council leader Rob Stewart said the project "will be a major step forward" for High Street's regeneration, and will build on "the great work that's already been done."
