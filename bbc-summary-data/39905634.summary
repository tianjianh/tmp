Captain Devlin is back from injury, while D'Acol has recovered from illness.
Dundee will assess some minor injuries, with defender Kevin Gomis and striker Marcus Haber having gone off with knocks against Inverness in midweek.
Centre-backs James McPake and Julen Etxabeguren are long-term absentees.
Hamilton sit second bottom of the table, one point ahead of Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as both face their final league game of the season.
Whoever finishes bottom will be relegated automatically, with the second bottom side facing a play-off against the winner of Friday's semi-final between Championship sides Falkirk and Dundee United.
Hamilton Academical midfielder Darian McKinnon: "The last time we played Motherwell, there was a lot of pressure because we really wanted to win that one.
"But, after the performance on Tuesday, we are all just looking forward to the game, playing well and winning the game.
"Luck can't keep going against you all the time and, after Tuesday, I am sure that's us used up all the bad luck and hopefully we can get a wee rub of the green on Saturday.
"We need to make sure we win the game and nothing else can put us down.
"Dundee are already safe and that can work both ways. The pressure might be off them, they can play brilliant, or they could be on holiday mode.
"We just need to take care of ourselves and win the game.
"We've had a terrible last four or five games, but we think we are good enough to stay in this league and hopefully we can prove that on Saturday."
Dundee interim manager Neil McCann: "I really couldn't care less about Hamilton, honestly all I care about is Dundee.
"We have got our main objective of retaining our Premiership status. But our standards were set from the first day I came in, which was to win the five games ahead of us. We won the first two, we were really unlucky not to win the third, and Wednesday although we tried, the start killed us.
"This is the next one and we want to win it for ourselves. We let ourselves down from the standards we set and we sent away a massive Dundee support disappointed."
