[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed reports the government is planning to allow nude weddings.

He was asked if a change in the law was being considered as part of a review of marriage laws.
"Not as far as I'm aware and I've certainly no intention of doing so," he told the BBC's Sunday Politics show.
The government was looking into humanist marriages in England and Wales, he said.
Humanism is a secular philosophy. Humanist weddings are not legally recognised in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - but they are legal in Scotland.
The Daily Mail reported on Tuesday that ministers had ordered a rethink of wedding laws, which could allow naturists to conduct weddings if the rules were changed.
It claimed a paper had been published by Mr Grayling which confirmed groups who have expressed an interest in changing wedding laws included British Naturism, the organisation that campaigns for a greater understanding and acceptance of outdoor nudism.
But Mr Grayling told the BBC: "It hasn't been ordered by me I can tell you that."
The justice secretary stressed there was a difference between someone "expressing an interest" and "something actually happening".
"No nude marriage right now as far as I'm concerned," he told the BBC.
