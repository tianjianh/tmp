Supermarket giant Sainsbury's is in talks about about selling a site which it had planned to use for a depot.

The BBC understands the firm has been in talks with rival Lidl about the site near Exeter Airport.
Sainsbury's said in 2014 it was postponing plans for a depot on the site employing up to 450 people.
The firm admitted it was now talking to "a number of interested businesses and was working to bring the site back into use at the earliest opportunity".
The supermarket depot would be an important asset for the Exeter and East Devon growth point.
It would be a flagship employer, but it is not just be a question of creating jobs.
The depot would also generate significant publicity and business confidence, which could be effective in helping to tempt other companies to invest there.
The site is at the Â£2bn Exeter and East Devon Growth Point economic development zone east of the M5.
Lidl said: "As part of our ongoing expansion plans we are continuously exploring opportunities across the UK.
"With regards to this region we will provide further information as and when we have any updates."
Tim Jones, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall business Council, said: "This would be a great lift for the economy of the growth point, and the area. It's a beacon for investment."
