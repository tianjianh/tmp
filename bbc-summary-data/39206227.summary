Police said it was believed a man attacked two women before inflicting stab injuries on himself.
Stun grenades were used as officers stormed the block of flats in Leasowes Drive, Penn, at about 09:45 GMT.
A woman and the male suspect, both believed to be in their 30s, died at the scene, West Midlands Police confirmed.

Officers said the stabbing was a domestic-related incident.
Stun grenades were used as officers stormed the flat in a bid to distract and detain the knifeman, West Midlands Police said.
They said the other woman, believed to be in her 50s, had been taken to hospital with critical stomach wounds, and two police officers were also injured.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the second woman was taken "to the major trauma centre at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham with potentially life-threatening stab wounds".
Armed officers could be seen outside the Highfield Court block of flats.
Supt Keith Fraser, from West Midlands Police, said unarmed officers who had entered the property to protect people inside were confronted by a man with a knife and they "deployed their Taser, which was initially ineffective".
He said armed officers had "then been requested to support the unarmed officers" and they "have used stun grenades to distract the armed man".
But the stun grenades were "ineffective we believe in relation to trying to stop this man from attacking officers".
One officer received a "stab wound to the arm" and the other sustained a leg injury after being chased by the suspect, Supt Fraser said.
"I want to stress that the man was armed so we had to act quickly and officers did that."
Mick Brice, a taxi driver, was near the scene when he said he saw "12 or 14 police cars".
A "paramilitary-style" police vehicle came "screaming down the road" and on to the scene, Mr Brice said, before he saw two officers take something out of the back and enter the flats.
