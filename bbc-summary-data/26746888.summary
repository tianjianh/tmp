The organisers of the event, near Beauly, said it was believed that it would be the first time the Welsh star had performed in the Highlands.
Jones, who has sold more than 100 million records since the 1960s, will appear on the main stage on 8 August.
Razorlight, Billy Bragg and Frightened Rabbit are among the other acts signed up to play at Belladrum.
Also The Bad Shepherds, whose line up includes comedian Adrian Edmondson, The Temperance Movement and The Mekons and Robbie Fulks.
Festival promoter Joe Gibbs said: "Sir Tom has long been a hero of mine and it is a singular privilege to be able to welcome him to a Highland stage.
"We are also thrilled by the appearance of Razorlight at Bella, whose last festival appearance in the Highlands was to headline Rock Ness in 2008."
Last year's festival sold out its 15,800 capacity six weeks in advance of it taking place.
