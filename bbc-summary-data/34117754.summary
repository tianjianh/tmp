Kevin Harris, 51, claimed he had stabbed his brother Mark, 47, in self-defence at their home in Summers Road, Farncombe, in February.
After a seven day trial at Guildford Crown Court, he was found guilty of murder and was sentenced.
Harris has been ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years.
During the trial, the court heard they had a disagreement about money with Harris admitting he had stabbed his brother to death before disposing of the knife in a canal.
Det Ch Insp Karen Mizzi from Surrey Police said: "This has been a deeply upsetting time for the family and although it is good that justice has been served, this is little comfort to them.
"I hope the conclusion of the judicial process will give the family some form of closure."
