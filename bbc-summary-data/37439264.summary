The 20-year-old will initially feature for the Tykes' development side, having played well for them in recent games against Ipswich and Portsmouth.
He can play as a striker or on the wing and was previously at Kidderminster.
"He's quick and strong, so he will be a dangerous asset in our attacking play," head of academy recruitment Bobby Hassell told the club website.
"He is also very hardworking off the ball, which is a very important and valuable skill to have.
"It's now down to him to keep working hard and get as much football under his belt as possible."
