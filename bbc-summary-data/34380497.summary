Upscale US grocery chain Whole Foods Market is cutting 1.6% of its workforce to help fund lower prices and technology upgrades.

The organic foods retailer, which is seeking to shake off a reputation for high prices, said it would axe around 1,500 jobs over the next eight weeks.
The cuts are aimed at reducing costs as it seeks to compete in a "rapidly changing marketplace".
A spokesperson told the BBC the cuts would not affect its nine UK stores.
Walter Robb, co-chief executive of Whole Foods Market, said: "This is a very difficult decision, and we are committed to treating affected team members in a caring and respectful manner."
He said staff would be offered transition pay, severance, or the chance to apply for other jobs.
Whole Foods said it anticipated some staff would find new jobs through existing vacancies, and in 100 new stores.
Some of those stores will be part of a new chain of smaller, more value-focused shops due to be launched next year.
Whole Foods shares dropped 0.7% in early trading in New York to $30.88.
Its shares have fallen 18% in the past year as it faces increasing competition in the US natural foods market.
More than 90,000 are employed by Whole Foods in its 420 stores in the US, Canada and UK.
It has seven shops in London, one in Cheltenham and one in Glasgow.
