[SN]TITLE[SN]
Prisoner back in jail after absconding in 1995

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who absconded from prison 22 years ago is back behind bars after being arrested in France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael John Ashworth, 57, was held in Coquelles on Sunday while trying to board a Eurotunnel shuttle to the UK.
He absconded from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire in 1995 during a five-year sentence for drugs offences and had been living in Holland.
Medway magistrates said Ashworth, who was arrested by Kent Police officers, must serve the rest of his sentence.
He had been accused of escaping from lawful custody, but the case was withdrawn by magistrates who heard he was on temporary licence and should not have been charged with the offence.
Police had said he absconded in 1995 from HMP Sudbury and failed to return having been released on temporary licence.
Ashworth said he had told police he wanted to hand himself in.
