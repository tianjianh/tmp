Repatriation of holiday death woman Christine Mann funded

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An insurance company has agreed to cover the cost of repatriating a 54-year-old Leicester woman who died while on holiday in Greece.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christine Mann died in hospital in Corfu on Saturday after suffering two strokes.
She had mistakenly taken out an insurance policy which did not cover her six-month long holiday.
Her family, of Mowmacre Hill, had been told they would have to raise Â£3,700 to bring her back to the UK.
Ms Mann's niece Leanne Gowing, 31, said: "It is absolutely amazing news, my grandfather is in tears because he is so relieved.
"It is nice to finally have some good news."
Ms Mann's 85-year-old father, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, had to return to Leicester alone from their yearly holiday. They should have returned on 28 October.
She had bought an annual mutli-trip travel insurance policy at the beginning of their six-month break in May, but the policy only covered a single trip for up to 30 days.
Direct Travel Insurance said: "As we now believe a genuine mistake was made we will pay the cost of bringing Ms Mann home.
"However we stress that it is important that when taking out any form of insurance that customers take care and shop for a policy that meets their specific needs."
The family said they hoped Ms Mann's body could now be flown home next week.
Because she was carrying a European Health Insurance Card, her medical expenses were covered for two weeks while she was in the Greek hospital.
