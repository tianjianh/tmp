The teenager was grabbed from behind by a man on a footpath between Mainway East and Wince Close in Middleton at about 16:45 GMT on 10 or 17 December.
Greater Manchester Police said the girl did not initially report the attack but told officers about it on Sunday.
She described the man as white, in his 20s or 30s, and with "teeth behind his teeth, as if it was a second row".
The "medium build" attacker was also said to have a local accent and lips that looked like they had a rash around them.
He was wearing a black polo shirt, black jeans or tracksuit bottoms and black trainers, a force spokesman said.
Det Insp Damian Simpson said it had taken the girl "some time to speak out but thankfully now she has come forward, we can give her specialist support for what is clearly a very disturbing incident.
"These offences are very rare and we will have extra officers patrolling the area over the coming days, especially around the time this offence occurred to reassure and safeguard the community," he said.
