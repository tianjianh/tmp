[SN]TITLE[SN]
Senior East of England Labour MEP Richard Howitt to stand down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior Labour MEP has announced plans to stand down from the European Parliament later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East of England Euro-MP Richard Howitt said he is to become chief executive of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), which links companies with society and the wider economy.
Mr Howitt is the Labour spokesman on foreign affairs in the European Parliament.
He is also the Socialist and Democrat Group human rights spokesperson.
Mr Howitt said: "It has been an enormous privilege to serve in this role (as MEP) and I cannot thank enough the countless people who I have sought to help - and who have shown extraordinary kindness in helping me.
"It will be a great privilege to apply my experience in Europe to a truly international role [at IIRC]."
The IIRC brings together a coalition of business, investment, regulatory and civil society representatives from around the world.
