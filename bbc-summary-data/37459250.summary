[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cambridge United 2-1 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Will Norris saved two injury-time penalties as nine-man Cambridge beat Accrington 2-1 in an astonishing finish in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norris saved from Chris Eagles in the first minute of time added on after Leon Legge was sent off for felling Terry Gornell, and later repelled Gornell's spot-kick after Brad Halliday was dismissed for punching Matty Pearson's header off the line.
Former Accrington player Piero Mingoia struck what proved to be the winner with a stunning volley nine minutes from time following tremendous play by substitute Uche Ikpeazu.
Mingoia had created Cambridge's opener after 14 minutes, whipping in a fine free-kick which was thumped home by Legge.
The visitors were level six minutes into the second half when Billy Kee rammed the ball home from close range after Norris had miraculously kept out Omar Beckles' header from Sean McConville's corner.
Accrington came within inches of taking the lead 12 minutes from time when Romy Boco's effort from outside the box thumped the inside of Norris' left-hand upright and rebounded to safety before the incredible drama in the final minutes.
