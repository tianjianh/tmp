"Two girls aged six and seven were taken to hospital, but despite the best efforts of medical staff died shortly after," police said.
The family were hit in Handsworth on Sunday while crossing a road.
The mother, 39, is critically ill and her daughter of 12 and son aged 13 are being treated for serious injuries.
A 34-year-old local man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of dangerous driving and has been released on bail.
Sgt Steve Newbury, from West Midlands Police's Collision Investigation Unit, said: "We continue to investigate the circumstances around this tragic incident and officers continue to liaise with the family of those involved.
"I am appealing for witnesses to come forward. In particular, I want passengers who were travelling on the number 101 bus at around noon along Grove Lane towards Oxhill road to call me or one of my team."
Birmingham City Council member Gurdial Singh Atwal, who has lived in Handsworth for nearly 50 years, said Grove Lane has been the scene of several accidents in recent years, including a fatal crash.
"I know every inch of Grove Lane and there have been problems here with traffic," he said.  "The roads seem very narrow these days with cars parked on one side, which can create problems for road users and pedestrians.
"Some people want more police to monitor the area, some people say they want speed cameras, others are concerned about drivers speeding.
"We will wait to see the results of the police investigation now."
