The 60-year-old Australian coach has worked with many of the world's best players in a 34-year career, including Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic.
Andy Murray has previously spoken highly of Brett, who was seen as a possible replacement for Ivan Lendl as the Wimbledon champion's coach.
Brett had reviewed the LTA's high performance system earlier this year.
"Bob's work ethic and attention to detail is incomparable," said LTA chief executive Michael Downey, who recruited Brett as a consultant while in charge of tennis in Canada.
Brett will relocate from Monaco to London, spend his time travelling the country to the LTA's high-performance centres, and Leon Smith and Iain Bates, heads of men's and women's tennis respectively, will report to him.
Asked about his salary, Michael Downey said, "I think we're getting great value for Bob Brett. I really believe his appointment fits within a mindset of the new cost-conscious LTA."
World number five Andy Murray is currently the only British male in the world top 100, while Heather Watson and Laura Robson are currently 69 and 80 in the women's rankings.
