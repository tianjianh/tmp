Buffon, who turns 38 on Thursday, helped Italy win the 2006 World Cup and has collected six Serie A titles with the Italian champions.
He told reporters at an awards ceremony in Milan: "If I can push myself up to the 2018 World Cup then I'll go on.
"After that I'll close the door and stop playing football," he added.
Buffon, who has played a record 154 times for Italy, is expected to be first choice at this summer's European Championships in France. Italy are in Group E with the Republic of Ireland, Belgium and Sweden.
He remains the world's most expensive goalkeeper after his Â£32.5m move from Parma to Juventus in 2001.
