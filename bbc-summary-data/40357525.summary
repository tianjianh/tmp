[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Dripping wet' fugitive hands himself in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspected drug smuggler has handed himself in to police in Gibraltar "dripping wet" after seeing himself on Crimewatch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Waterman "arrived without warning, dripping salt water and carrying a bag of wet clothing".
The 32-year-old, originally from Watford, handed himself in late on Monday.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) is now attempting to extradite him under a European arrest warrant.
The NCA said: "He refused to say how he reached Gibraltar, only that it wasn't through the frontier."
Mr Waterman, whose nicknames include Jugs and Jumbo, was wanted in connection with a drug trafficking investigation.
Border police found 7kg (15lb) of cocaine, with a potential street value of Â£1.2m, at Bagby Airfield in October 2015.
The discovery was made shortly after a light aircraft arrived from the Netherlands. The plane's pilot was arrested but later found not guilty of importation offences.
Brian Shaw, NCA North East operations manager, said: "It might sound like a cushy number, sitting around watching Crimewatch Roadshow on a Monday morning, but life as a fugitive is hard and stressful.
"The NCA first issued an appeal for Waterman in London nearly a year ago. Clearly something about the new appeal made him crack.
"To everyone else feeling the stress of being on the run, I would say we are patient people, we keep the pressure on, and we never stop looking for you."
