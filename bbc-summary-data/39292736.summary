On Wednesday, US shares closed higher after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to a range of 0.75%-1%, from 0.5%-0.75%.
The Fed also indicated it planned two more rate rises this year, compared with some predictions that three more increases were possible.
The slightly softer tone from the Fed helped to boost bank shares.
Dow components Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase were both about 1% higher, and the Dow Jones itself was up 48.15 points at 20,998.25.
The broader S&P 500 index rose 2.48 points to 2,387.74 while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 7.58 points to 5,907.63.
