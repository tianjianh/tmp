"He dropped to his hands and knees, he kissed my feet, and said 'thank you for saving my life.'"

That moment of gratitude from an elderly man brought home to Able Mechanic Emmett Kelly the importance of the work he and his shipmates were doing in rescuing migrants in the Mediterranean.
The 25-year-old Irish navy sailor has just completed a seven-week humanitarian rescue operation on the Irish Naval Service vessel, LÉ Eithne.
The ship brought more than 3,376 people to safety after it was deployed on 16 May.
AM Kelly, from Londonderry, helped rescue thousands of migrants from across the Middle East and Africa, including a  two-week-old baby.
"It was quite shocking, I remember being handed the baby, a perfectly healthy little child. You don't expect to see children at sea, certainly not a two-week old baby.
"Some people are just so desperate to be saved," he said.
"They're leaving everything they know behind, in the search for a better life."
Emmett said migrants would panic at the first sight of the ship and would want to climb on board.
"The main thing was to keep them calm and let them know they're safe.
"During our time down there, we came across various boats in the water. We'd bring the migrants on board, give them food, water and medical attention.
"Once they're safe, we find a port, either in Sicily or mainland Italy, and we would drop them off there.
"The majority of people would be sea-sick and wouldn't be used to being in the sea.
"Knowing that we had them on board and that they would be safe - that was a great feeling."
Emmett said thousands of migrants have died crossing the Mediterranean from Libya towards the European coastline.
He communicated with migrants using hand signals and also learned some Arabic and French to speak to the migrants.
The crew also brought supplies of colouring books and crayons for rescued children "to keep them in their youth".
"Back in Northern Ireland, we are very much wrapped up in our own bubble and it's a different life out here - you have to sympathise with these people. It's just heartbreaking."
But the rescue mission that included the elderly migrant and his family is one that Emmett said he will never forget.
'Thankful'
He said the man was desperate to be saved and was on the verge of tears when he was rescued.
"Once we got him on board, he dropped to his knees, kissed my feet, stood up and kissed my hand and said 'thank you sir for saving my life and my family's.'"
"You realise then that these people are so desperate to get away. That really hit home.
"You have to take a step back and realise that we didn't just bring this man on board - we saved his life.
"He was just so thankful for what we did."
Emmett said: "I got great relief out of getting people on board and knowing they were better off with us and knowing they would be safe.
"You could be talking up to 30 different nationalities, over the 22 operations we carried out".
Emmett said leaving Derry was difficult.
"I knew joining the navy that I was going to have to make a sacrifice  - I wouldn't be home every night, I wouldn't be getting my dinner on the table every night, and there'd be no one to wash my clothes."
But he said that this "different life" is an exciting challenge.
"There's an old saying that the navy is not just a job, it's a way of life and I really believe that."
The LÉ Eithne and its crew of 69 sailors arrived home to a heroes' welcome at the Irish naval base in Haulbowline, County Cork on Friday.
