Lyndhurst starred as a time-travelling TV repairman who had a second life in 1940s London in the popular 1990s show.
Writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran said his character Gary Sparrow had been "trying for the last 17 years to find a way back to the present".
The one-off special will be part of a season marking the 60th anniversary of Hancock's Half Hour's first broadcast.
The season will also include new episodes of Are You Being Served?, Steptoe and Son, Till Death Us Do Part, Porridge, Keeping Up Appearances and Up Pompeii!.
Goodnight Sweetheart was first broadcast on BBC One on 18 November 1993.
The initial cast included Michelle Holmes as Gary's wife Yvonne Sparrow, Victor McGuire as his best friend Ron Wheatcroft, while his war-time companions were Christopher Ettridge as bumbling PC Reg Deadman and Dervla Kirwan as Phoebe.
The writing duo said the new episode would feature "much-loved old Goodnight Sweetheart friends and one or two new ones".
BBC Comedy Commissioning controller Shane Allen said the whole season was "geared towards giving comedy royalty their due recognition".
"In Goodnight Sweetheart, we have heavyweight writing and performing talents reunited in this hugely popular and fondly remembered show," he said.
"The conceptual update is sublime and it was heart-skipping stuff to read - it's an absolute belter."
