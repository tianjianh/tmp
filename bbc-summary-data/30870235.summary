New M4 speed cameras go live in Port Talbot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New average 50mph speed enforcement cameras on the M4 through Port Talbot have gone live.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The four cameras were installed in October on a two-mile stretch and during a trial period hundreds of motorists a day were found to be ignoring the speed limit.
Enforcement action will come into force from Monday.
It will be the first permanent installation to go into operation on a Welsh section of the motorway.
Wales Road Casualty Reduction Partnership GoSafe said the testing period gave  motorists a chance to become familiar with the limit and adjust their speeds and driving behaviour.
