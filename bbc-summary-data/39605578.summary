[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 1-0 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Thomas scored the only goal of the game as Coventry City climbed off the foot of the table with victory over 10-man Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The young striker, who also got the winning goal when Coventry won the EFL Trophy at Wembley earlier this month, netted seven minutes before the interval to bring a welcome win for Mark Robins' side.
Coventry, who have been in the relegation zone since November and bottom for three months, had already been condemned to relegation. But, with just a game left, they at least climb above Chesterfield, who lost at home to Charlton.
The Saddlers should have taken the lead in the 32nd minute when Matt Preston headed wide from inside the area. And he was quickly made to pay when, on 38 minutes, Thomas stroked the ball home from the edge of a crowded penalty area.
Gael Bigirimana headed off the line from Eoghan O'Connell 11 minutes into the second half, while the home side survived strong claims for a penalty when the ball hit the hand of Jordan Willis.
In only his third game back after a month out through injury, Walsall then had O'Connell sent off for a second yellow card with 20 minutes remaining, ruling him out of the mid-table Saddlers' home game with relegation battlers Port Vale on Tuesday night.
