Participants will be painted blue on Saturday and pose in front of various city landmarks as part of the project named Sea of Hull.
The work is by internationally-renowned photographer Spencer Tunick and has been commissioned by the city's Ferens Art Gallery.
It will be exhibited as part of the year-long arts festival in 2017.
More on this and other Hull and East Yorkshire stories.
New York-based Tunick has created more than 90 similar human installations worldwide, including at the Sydney Opera House, the Place des Arts in Montreal, Mexico City and Munich in Germany.
His work in the UK has used places such as Gateshead and Folkestone as backdrops.
Mr Tunick said his work "touches upon the long history of the nude in art".
"Clothing is somebody else's art work," he said. "Fashion is art. By taking away the option of fashion I am working with the true essence of equality and nature."
More than 2,000 people signed up to take part in the photo shoot when the project was announced in March.
Labour councillor Terry Geraghty, said he was "delighted by the tremendous public response."
"It promises to be a fantastic event and to make history in terms of capturing the city during this first stage of its public realm transformation," he said.
Hull City Council said some roads in the city centre would be closed on Saturday morning as part of the shoot.
