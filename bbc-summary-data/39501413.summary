[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Hirons used a tractor and muck spreader to cover the steps of Derby Crown Court on the 17 January.
Prosecutors said the action was a "deliberate insult to justice."
Hirons, 49, of Nottingham Road, Draycott, Derbyshire, admitted criminal damage and apologised "unreservedly" for what happened.

Police said Hirons turned up at about 07:10 GMT on 17 January to dump the muck, leaving a red Massey Ferguson tractor and spreader on the pavement.
Officers said it took council workers hours to clean up.
A note left in the window of the tractor cab suggested the muck spreading was a protest against a "severely flawed judicial system."
Hirons was ordered to pay Â£446 in fines and Â£667 to Derby City Council for the clean-up and prosecution costs.
He was also given a parking ticket, which he said was further "salt in the wound."
