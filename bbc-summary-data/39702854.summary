The 20-year-old hit 66 not out to claim a draw and 13 points for Glamorgan after the Welsh county were set a target of 355 to win.
Glamorgan's draw at Leicestershire followed defeats in their opening two games of the season.
"It's nice to get a few points on the board," Donald said.
"There were key points throughout the game where we stood up and showed our worth which we probably haven't done in the few games before.
"It's pushing us in the right direction ready for the 50-over game."
Glamorgan are away to Gloucestershire in the first game of the Royal London One-Day Cup on Thursday, 27 April.
Former England Under-19 captain Donald, says the block of eight games in the competition will suit Glamorgan.
"We're looking forward to it and we feel we've got a very strong white ball squad which we showed at points last year," said Donald.
"With the addition of Marchant [de Lange] and hopefully a couple of guys coming back fit sooner rather than later, we're going to be a real test for any team."
Batsman Will Bragg and bowler Timm van der Gugten could return for Thursday's match in Bristol following injuries.
Donald is looking forward to facing Gloucestershire, who won the competition in 2015.
"They're always a strong 50-over team and do what they do very well," Donald added.
"They have a set game plan that they stick to and we know what to expect.
"But we're looking forward to getting out there. We feel we can compete really well in this competition.
"That quarter-final spot is a big aim for us and there's no reason why we shouldn't achieve that."
