Crewe Alexandra 2-2 Mansfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two title favourites Mansfield had to come from behind to earn a draw at Crewe thanks to second-half goals from Danny Rose and Dave Mirfin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Stags struggled to impose themselves on a lively Crewe side, who twice led through powerful headers from Chris Porter.
Early on, Chris Dagnall's fierce drive could not be held by Conrad Logan, who was rather fortunate when the Crewe striker clipped a tame shot into his arms.
Lee Angol went close for the visitors with a dipping free kick, but the hosts went even closer when Callum Ainley's angled drive was kept out by Logan.
The Railwaymen deserved their half-time lead when Porter headed in after George Cooper's corner was directed back across goal by Michael Raynes.
Steve Evans' side were level when Rose headed Mal Benning's cross into the far corner in the 54th minute.
Porter conjured an eye-catching finish when he glanced Cooper's delivery beyond Logan into the far corner in the 63rd minute, but Mansfield were level again three minutes later when defender Mirfin ghosted in at the far post to bundle in Joel Byrom's long free kick.
Mansfield could have won it but Ben Garratt kept out a late effort from Paul Anderson.
