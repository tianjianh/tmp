A mother-of-two who fatally stabbed her ex-partner in a row at her Liverpool house has been jailed for life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Farieissia Martin, 22, denied murdering 21-year-old Kyle Farrell, who died of a single stab wound to the chest from a knife early on 21 November 2014.
Mr Farrell had been babysitting the couple's young children before Martin returned to her home in Charlecote Street, Dingle, where a row broke out.
The judge at Liverpool Crown Court ordered her to serve at least 13 years.
Martin had been out drinking with a friend on the night of Mr Farrell's death, the court heard, before she confronted him when she returned home.
He had been looking after their children, who are now aged two-and-a-half and one.
Det Ch Insp Natalie Perischine said: "Although they were no longer a couple they had two young children together and so saw each other regularly."
"It was unfortunately sometimes a volatile relationship and our investigation established that there had been verbal and physical abuse from both sides in the past.
"Tragically this escalated in extreme fashion on the night Farieissia came back from a night drinking at a friend's house.
"An argument ensued and for reasons no-one will ever know, she stabbed Kyle fatally in the chest."
