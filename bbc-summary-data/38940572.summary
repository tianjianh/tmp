Maidstone United 4-2 Chester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four first-half goals helped Maidstone United blitz Chester at the Gallagher Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Lokko got the hosts off to a sensational start with a second-minute strike, and Delano Sam-Yorke doubled the lead just three minutes later.
Joe Pigott steered in Tom Mills's cross inside 15 minutes, and Alex Flisher could so easily have made it four, but hit the post.
On the stroke of half time, Lokko added to his side's tally with a looping header over Lynch.
In the second half, James Alabi pulled one back from the penalty spot and Sam Hughes headed in Ryan Lloyd's free-kick, but they did not threaten Maidstone's lead.
