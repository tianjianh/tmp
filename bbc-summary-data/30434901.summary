Power failure forces closure of Cardiff Crown Court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A power failure at Cardiff Crown Court has forced the building to closure and cases to be heard elsewhere.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The electricity cut out on Wednesday and urgent cases had to be sent to Newport Crown Court.
Power had still not been restored on Thursday and work had to be transferred to Cardiff Magistrates' Court.
A spokeswoman for HM Courts & Tribunals Service said: "We are working closely with contractors to re-open the building as soon as possible."
