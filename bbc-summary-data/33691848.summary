[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Hughes, who was 60 and from Warrington, Cheshire, lost control of his 1000cc BMW near the Les Graham memorial on Mountain Road on 31 May.
Douglas courthouse heard he suffered multiple injuries and died the same day in Noble's hospital.
Coroner John Needham recorded a verdict of accidental death.
One witness described how Mr Hughes collided with a grass bank after losing control of his bike on a left-hand bend near the Verandah.
The married welder was visited the island with his friend Andrew Webster, also from Warrington.
Mr Webster, who was following his friend at the time of the accident, said he went in a "bit hot" and that his "tyres were not gripping".
He said he saw his friend's bike "somersaulting down the road" with "debris thrown everywhere".
Mr Needham said Mr Hughes was "clearly passionate about bikes and followed his passion right to the end.
"As a former [Manx] Grand Prix racer he was very familiar with the TT course but drifted wide on the left hand corner, losing the back end of the bike.
"He would not have suffered after losing consciousness."
No other vehicles were involved in the accident, which happened the day after the opening practice session of the annual TT races.
