Airbus UK Broughton suspended Ryan Wade over comments on his Twitter account.
Former Sunderland player Johnson, 28, admitted grooming and sexual activity with a girl aged 15 and was convicted of a charge of sexual touching.
Airbus said midfielder Wade, 28, had been "suspended with immediate effect pending further investigation".
The Twitter comments were made on Thursday, the day after Johnson was convicted at Bradford Crown Court.
Gwyn Derfel, secretary of the Welsh Premier League (WPL), said: "The Dafabet Welsh Premier League is aware of the alleged comments and the FAW's (Football Association of Wales) compliance department is looking into the matter."
The club, based in Broughton, Flintshire, said in a statement it did not "condone or support the comments".
It is understood the WPL is trying to gather evidence of the tweets.
The FAW has disciplinary powers and at the start of every season every player is sent a code of conduct on behaviour, which includes activity on social media.
Wade signed for Airbus almost four years ago and has made 28 appearances this season, scoring four times.
