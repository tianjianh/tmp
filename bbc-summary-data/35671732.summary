Scotland lost their first two Six Nations matches, against England and Wales, and defeat in Rome would make it 10 successive championship defeats stretching back to 2014.
"Our performances have been fairly good but it's a results-based business," said 23-year-old Hogg.
He said the Scotland players are "definitely not looking at the record".
Scotland's most recent victory in the Six Nations was their 21-20 win at the Stadio Olimpico two years ago, courtesy of Duncan Weir's late drop goal.
After the trip to Italy, they face France at Murrayfield on 13 March and Ireland in Dublin on 19 March.
"We are dying to get that win and we have been working incredibly hard," said Glasgow Warriors' Hogg.
"Getting a win would do wonders for us. If we were to get that win then I can see us winning the next two games as well.
"The last couple of weeks have been bitterly disappointing, having come away with two defeats, but Saturday is a chance to make amends."
Italy are bottom of the Six Nations table after also losing their opening two matches, against France and England.
They beat Scotland 22-19 at Murrayfield in last year's Six Nations thanks to a late penalty try.
Italy captain Sergio Parisse, who will win his 117th cap on Saturday, said: "Everyone is talking about this game and how both Scotland and Italy have no victories in their opening two matches, so this weekend is a crucial match.
"Maybe we have more pressure because we are playing at home.
"In the past we lost against them here in Rome with a last-minute drop-goal but last year we went to Murrayfield and got a try late.
"You know that Scotland-Italy matches are always tough to win.
"It would be arrogant on my part to say we are better than Scotland in the forwards or in the backs.
"They are a really strong team, but we are a really strong team too. I'm confident in our strengths."
