[SN]TITLE[SN]
Welsh Laverbread awarded EU protected food status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A traditional Welsh dish has been successful in applying for protected food status.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Welsh Laverbread has been awarded special designation under European law, meaning no other producer can use its name.
The dish is made from cooked nori seaweed picked from the Welsh coast.
It joins the likes of Anglesey Sea Salt, Conwy Mussels, Pembrokeshire Early Potatoes and Welsh Lamb which have already been granted the status.
The recognition comes after a four year application process by Selwyn's Seafood, based in Penclawdd in Gower, Swansea.
The status recognises foods which are produced, processed and prepared in a specific region using recognised expertise, such as Champagne and Parma Ham.
There are currently 80 protected names in the UK, made up of food products, wine, beers, ciders, spirits and wool.
In total, 12 Welsh products have now been awarded protected status.
Lesley Griffiths, cabinet secretary for environment and rural affairs, said: "Wales' reputation for high-quality food and drink continues to go from strength to strength."
