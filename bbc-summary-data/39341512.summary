Sheffield United defender Daniel Lafferty has been called into the Northern Ireland squad for Sunday's World Cup qualifier with Norway.

The 27-year-old left-back made his international debut in 2012 and has won 13 caps for his country.
Lafferty adds to manager Michael O'Neill's defensive options for the Windsor Park match in Belfast.
Northern Ireland lie second in Group C, five points behind Germany with two wins for their four qualifiers.
Norway are in a disappointing fifth place, having picked up just three points from four games.
O'Neill is without Will Grigg for the Norway encounter after the Wigan Athletic striker was ruled out with a knee injury.
Shane Ferguson is also an absentee, with the versatile Millwall player serving a suspension.
Northern Ireland's 3-0 friendly defeat by Croatia on 15 November brought to an end a 10-game unbeaten home record, O'Neill's side having previously won eight and drawn two at Windsor Park, conceding only three goals in the process.
Their last loss in a home competitive fixturewas a 4-2 defeat at the hands of Portugal in a World Cup qualifier in September 2013.
Northern Ireland squad to face Norway:
Goalkeepers: Michael McGovern (Norwich City), Alan Mannus (St Johnstone), Roy Carroll (Linfield)
Defenders: Aaron Hughes (Hearts), Gareth McAuley (West Brom), Jonny Evans (West Brom), Chris Brunt (West Brom), Craig Cathcart (Watford), Conor McLaughlin (Fleetwood Town), Lee Hodson (Rangers), Ryan McLaughlin (Oldham Athletic), Tom Flanagan (Burton Albion), Daniel Lafferty (Sheffield Utd)
Midfielders: Steven Davis (Southampton), Niall McGinn (Aberdeen), Oliver Norwood (Brighton), Corry Evans (Blackburn Rovers), Jamie Ward (Nottingham Forest), Stuart Dallas (Leeds Utd), Paul Paton (St Johnstone), Matthew Lund (Rochdale)
Forwards: Kyle Lafferty (Norwich City), Josh Magennis (Charlton Athletic), Conor Washington (QPR), Liam Boyce (Ross County)
