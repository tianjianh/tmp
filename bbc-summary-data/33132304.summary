The 39-year-old woman was sexually assaulted then held round the neck until she became unconscious.
The attack took place on the Leeds Liverpool canal near Viaduct road in Leeds at about 06:00 BST last Wednesday, West Yorkshire Police said.
Police released CCTV pictures last week in an attempt to find the suspect.
Detectives want to speak to cyclists who were in the area early last Wednesday and may be potential witnesses.
