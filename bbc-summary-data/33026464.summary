[SN]TITLE[SN]
Duke of Buccleuch was 'an actor' in Yarnwinder probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish aristocrat has told a court that he became "an actor" in an undercover police operation to secure the return of a stolen masterpiece.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Scott, the 10th Duke of Buccleuch, gave evidence at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, where he is challenging a Â£4.25m legal action.
Marshall Ronald claims the duke owes him the sum for recovering the artwork.
Madonna of the Yardwinder was taken from the duke's family home, Drumlanrig Castle, near Thornhill, in 2003.
The Leonardo Da Vinci painting was recovered in 2007 after Mr Ronald, of Upholland, Lancashire, sent a message to an undercover officer stating: "The Lady is coming home".
Three years later the former lawyer was cleared of conspiring to extort money for its return at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Mr Ronald claims in the civil action that the duke provided a letter of authority confirming that the officer, known as John Craig, acted as his agent in the recovery of the painting and was authorised to conduct negotiations.
He contends that the Â£4.25m was the amount agreed to be paid to him for his role in securing the return of the masterpiece and that the agreement was made by Craig acting on behalf of the Duke.
The duke maintained in the action that Craig had no actual authority to enter any agreement or negotiate on his behalf.
It is said the letter of authority was requested by the police as part of their undercover operation and was designed to support John Craig's undercover persona.
Giving evidence in court, the duke said he first became aware of an undercover operation mounted by the police in 2006.
He said he was informed that a man by the name of Brown had convinced the police that he had seen the painting and possibly had access to it.
He said he was asked by an officer to have a phone conversation with him which he did. "I knew I had to act out a role," he said.
He added: "I was an actor in a process which they were devising and creating."
The judge, Lord Brailsford, reserved his decision in the case.
