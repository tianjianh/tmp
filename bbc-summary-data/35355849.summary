The equipment was taken from two properties in Pooley Bridge and one in Watermillock over the weekend. There was also an attempted burglary in Eamont Bridge.
The area was hit by severe flooding caused by Storm Desmond in December.
A Cumbria Police spokesman described the thefts as "despicable", and appealed for information.
The items stolen were two Dri-Eaz dehumidifiers, two DRI-EAZ electric fans, two large Belfort dehumidifiers and one Polygone dehumidifier, with a total value of more than Â£3,000.
