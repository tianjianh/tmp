A 36-year-old man in Leeds and a 27-year-old man in Normanton both died on Saturday.
It is thought the deaths were drugs-related although toxicology results are being awaited, said police.
Meanwhile, three men and a woman were found dead at separate addresses in South Yorkshire on Good Friday.
In the latest incident, officers found a man's body at a property in Compton View, Leeds, at about 08:20 BST on Saturday.
Paramedics were then called to a man with breathing difficulties in Park Green, Normanton, at about 12:50 BST. He died at the scene.
Neither death is being treated as suspicious, said detectives.
Det Ch Insp Jim Dunkerley, said: "We do believe these deaths are Class A drugs-related."
Class A drugs include heroin, cocaine (including crack), methadone, ecstasy (MDMA), LSD, and magic mushrooms.
The force said it was aware of warnings issued by other police forces about unusually strong heroin or derivates possibly in circulation.
"It seems prudent to issue a warning now to local drugs users", said Det Ch Insp Dunkerley.
