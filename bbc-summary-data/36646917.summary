White and black Americans split on race

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Views on racial discrimination and race differ wildly among black and white Americans, a new report from the Pew Research Center has found.

Most black Americans say they are treated unfairly and do not feel that racial equality has been achieved in the US, according to the report.
Eighty-eight percent of black Americans surveyed think the country must change, but only 55% of white Americans.
The survey comes amid ongoing conversations about race in the US.
Race tensions are high in the US, especially with the 2016 presidential election approaching.
There are more than 1,000 deadly shootings by police in the country each year, and those killed are disproportionately black Americans.
The fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Missouri in 2014 by police sparked protests across the country and gave fire to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Other key points from the report:
"Blacks, far more than whites, say black people are treated unfairly across different realms of life, from dealing with the police to applying for a loan or mortgage. And, for many blacks, racial equality remains an elusive goal," the report's authors write.
There were 3,769 adults polled between 29 February and 8 May of 2016 - a group made up of 1,799 white, 1,004 black and 654 Hispanic Americans.
