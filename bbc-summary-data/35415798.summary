The loose-head moved from the Arms Park to the Premiership club in 2009.
Gill said: "I have strong Wales ambitions that I want to fulfil and I feel playing well for Cardiff Blues can help me achieve that aim."
The 29-year-old has helped Sarries win two English top-flight titles and was a 2014 European Champions Cup runner-up.
Blues boss Danny Wilson said: "He has won trophies and experienced being part of one of the top environments in English rugby.
"Rhys has been a regular in the Saracens squad and he will bring a lot to us, both inside and outside of the set-piece."
Gill, who has made more than 130 Saracens appearances, last played for Wales against Italy in last year's Six Nations and was overlooked for the World Cup that followed.
Blues veteran Gethin Jenkins, experienced Osprey Paul James and 23-year-old Scarlet Rob Evans are Wales' loose-head picks for the 2016 Six Nations.
Gill says he has been impressed by Blues' form this season, and by the signings of Ulster back-rower Nick Williams, former Australia prop Salesi Ma'afu and Wales utility back Matthew Morgan.
"I've worked with Danny [Wilson] before so I've always known about his vision and his understanding of the game," said Gill, who made his Blues debut in 2006 having graduated from the academy side.
"He is changing things for the better and has already made some high-calibre signings.
"I've had a great time at Saracens; it's a brilliant club and I've loved the atmosphere and environment. We've had some success and I want to play a big role the rest of this season."
Saracens were Â£45.1m in debt, according to their accounts to June 2015.
