Ryan Fraser put Ipswich ahead just before the hour, turning in the area after Freddie Sears picked him out with a cross from the right.
Garath McCleary equalised from the penalty spot after Hal Robson-Kanu was tripped by Cole Skuse.
Brett Pitman then combined with fellow substitute Luke Varney to side-foot in a winner with a minute remaining.
Reading, now without a league win in four games, slip to 16th in the table.
There was little entertainment in the first half, but after the break Sears found space down the wing and loanee Fraser had time to spin and score his sixth goal of the season.
McCleary failed to pick out Matej Vydra on the break as Reading pounced on a mistake by Jonas Knudsen, but moments later Skuse's clumsy challenge allowed McCleary to convert from the spot.
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy's attacking substitution was eventually rewarded when Pitman slid in at the far post for his ninth goal of the season.
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"It was a great win and it is brilliant when your subs come on and contribute like that.
"I'm chuffed for them and chuffed for everyone. It wasn't a great game, but I think Reading are a really good side - it was one of our hardest matches of the season.
"I said at half-time that we needed to keep grinding away, even if we nicked it in the last minute. It was not a cunning plan, it was a tough and rather scrappy match.
"But we showed endeavour and resilience and Brett Pitman showed what a fantastic finisher he is."
Reading manager Brian McDermott told BBC Radio Berkshire:

"It was a sickener, it really was. But, I can't complain about the spirit and the commitment.
"It was a pretty ugly game, I knew what we'd be coming into tonight and that's what happened.
"I thought we might go on and win the game at 1-1 when we got the penalty, but it wasn't to be.
"Really disappointed. But everything in there, the spirit, the commitment, the guts. I can't have any complaints with that."
