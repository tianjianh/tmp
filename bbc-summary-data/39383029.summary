We spoke to poet and author Michael Rosen, BBC Radio 1's Dr Radha and 14-year-old Josh, who has a mental health problem called obsessive compulsive disorder.
Here, they give their advice about why it's important to talk about how we're feeling.
To learn more about Josh's story - and to find out how talking about what he's going through has really helped him - watch Inside My Head: A Newsround Special here.
And to find out more about the reasons people can find it hard to talk about mental health issues, and to get advice if you feel like this is something that is affecting you, read Newsround's guide.
