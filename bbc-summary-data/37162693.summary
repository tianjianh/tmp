A post-mortem examination will be carried out later, police said.
The East of England Ambulance Service confirmed paramedics were called to Chapman Way at about 17:20 BST.
"Sadly nothing could be done for the woman and she was pronounced dead," a spokesman said.
"Our thoughts are with her family and friends."
The man was taken to Hinchingbrooke Hospital near Huntingdon, but the ambulance service was unable to give details of his injuries.
The care home, near St Neots, consists of 34 one-bedroom flats and shared on-site facilities including a library and restaurant.
Its specialised services include caring for adults with dementia, physical disabilities and sensory impairments.
It is managed by Hanover Housing Association and was rated as good by health watchdog the Care Quality Commission in its 2016 inspection.
