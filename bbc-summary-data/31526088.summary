It is feared schoolboy Cameron Comey, who is from the town, fell into the River Towy on Tuesday after playing with his brother nearby.
The rescue operation has now lasted three days and is scheduled to resume on Friday morning.
A team of 50 are involved in the search including Dyfed-Powys Police, the fire service, coastguard and lifeboat teams.
On Thursday, the specialist dive team from South Wales Police joined the search while the police helicopter was on hand to assist in identifying possible search areas.
Philip Grice, deputy chairman of governors at Queen Elizabeth High School, where Cameron is a pupil, said it was a "terrible time" for everyone.
"Our hearts and thoughts and prayers go out to the young man and his family," he said.
"They are quite a well-known family in the town and they have lived here for many years."
Prayers for Cameron and the lighting of candles will take place in St Peter's Church in Carmarthen at 10:00 GMT on Friday.
Ministers and local vicars of all denominations will be present at the church.
Wet weather has made search conditions more difficult and the river is fast flowing.
Kayaks and boats have been out on the water while dogs and search crews have walked along the river banks near the spot, known locally as "the steels", where Cameron is believed to have fallen in.
It is given that name because of steel plates forming new banks after the river was moved to make way for a new dual carriageway.
Dyfed-Powys police and crime commissioner Christopher Salmon tweeted his thanks to the search teams and the public for their efforts in the search. He added: "Thoughts with family."
Anyone in the area between 14:00 and 16:00 GMT on Tuesday is asked to call the police on 101.
