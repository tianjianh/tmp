World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury will face no police action following an inquiry into alleged homophobic comments.

Greater Manchester Police (GMP) received a complaint earlier this week after statements made on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
But the force has recorded the comments as a "hate incident" as opposed to a hate crime.
Fury, 27, beat Wladimir Klitschko last month to claim the world titles.
In the aftermath of his win in Dusseldorf, which saw Fury claim the WBA, IBF and WBO titles, he said: "I'm not sexist. I believe a woman's best place is in the kitchen and on her back. That's my personal belief. Making me a good cup of tea, that's what I believe."
The new world champion has also previously said it would only take the legalisation of paedophilia in addition to the decriminalisation of homosexuality and abortion to see "the devil come home".
A complaint was made to GMP, sparking an investigation, but the force has concluded Fury will not face any charges.
In a statement, GMP said: "Officers spoke with the man that made the report and he provided a statement to police.
"This matter has been investigated in line with national hate crime policy and has been recorded as a hate incident.
"The circumstances in which these comments were made suggest that no criminal offence has taken place and this matter will not be investigated any further."
But the fighter, who lives in Morecambe, faces a further investigation after the British Boxing Board of Control summoned him to attend a meeting next year to explain his comments. No date has been fixed.
A petition was raised to get Fury removed from the shortlist for BBC Sports Personality of the Year.
Fellow nominee and long jump champion Greg Rutherford had planned to withdraw from this year's event over Fury's comments, before reversing his decision.
