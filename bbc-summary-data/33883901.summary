Salvation Army HQ hosts fringe shows

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Edinburgh Fringe prides itself on turning every space in the city into a venue.

And among the venues this year is the headquarters of the Salvation Army - which is marking its own 150th anniversary with a series of shows.
Given its own history in music - and in music halls - it is an apt setting.
Music has long been the trademark of the Salvation Army - and with a community centre in the heart of Edinburgh's Fringe - it seemed the obvious festival venue.
The music is eclectic - but more contemporary than classic brass band. And don't expect any hymns.
Marjory Watson is a singer, and a member of the church. She has programmed a mini festival of music in the Salvation Army's community centre in the Pleasance.
She said: "If there's something big going on, why not be a part of it? It's such a waste to have a building here and not to use it, and so it's really the perfect place and the perfect opportunity, just to be in Edinburgh at this time and to use all the talents at our disposal as well."
It's all very apt given the Salvation Army's roots in 19th century London. Set up in 1865, its mission was to help the poor. Like an army, its members wore uniforms, sang battle hymns, and dispensed soup, soap and salvation.
They also targeted popular music halls of the day, and 150 years later it remains their ethos in Edinburgh and beyond.
For Lisa Lewis, senior vocal teacher at Perth College, the venue offers a perfect platform for her students.
She said: "It'll be a good opportunity for my students because it's a different setting for them.
"It's important for them to learn to deal with that when you're performing, to have an audience that's very focused on you and not mulling through a crowd or have other things going on in the background. So that's particularly good for them."
Competition is tough on the fringe, but the Salvation Army are a hardy bunch - and Marjory believes that venue 405 is a much-needed addition.
She said: "What Salvation Army has always tried to do from its early beginnings is to try to be relevant to the society it finds itself in.
"Sometimes it's got that right, other times it's got a little bit lost. I think being in the festival is relevant to what's going on just now. Hopefully the music and the performances that will be given will be relevant to the people who come in our door.
"Hopefully it will be more than four people and a dog. I know that we've sold some tickets so that's really encouraging. I think the average audience is four for the festival so if we've got more than that we're doing better."
