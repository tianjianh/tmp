El Hassani, 43, lies one shot off the lead after making three birdies and 15 pars in Rabat, Morocco.
"I hit a couple of fairways and I also made a couple of recovery shots like Seve Ballesteros," said the Moroccan.
Jason Scrivener, Francesco Laporta and Thomas Linard top the leaderboard after carding a four under par round of 68.
The European Tour and Ladies European Tour are staging both the men's and women's tournaments at the same venue for the first time this week.
The men are playing on the red course, while the neighbouring blue course is hosting the Lalla Meryem Cup. England's Florentyna Parker led at the end of the first day after a five under par 67.
Compatriot Liz Young is among the pack just one shot behind.
