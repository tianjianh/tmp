Robbers drove through a Suffolk town dragging a ticket machine behind them after ripping it out of the ground "all for the sake of £50".

The moment the thieves levered the car park machine out of its hard-standing with rope attached to their 4x4 vehicle was caught on CCTV cameras in Sudbury.
The machine was pulled out of the train station car park at about 04:30 GMT on Thursday.
Babergh District Council said the theft was "simply not worth it".
Frank Lawrenson, portfolio holder for environment at the council, which owns the site, called it a "mindless, deliberate, act of vandalism".
"Babergh's machines do not have huge amounts of money kept in them overnight - a lot of people pay electronically or have a season ticket, and we empty the machines regularly," he said.
"It simply is not worth it for the thieves to take part in this type of activity."
Mr Lawrenson added there were no plans at present to replace the stolen machine, which is worth £4,000, as there were two others.
