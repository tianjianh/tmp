The top seed, who lost to Egyptian El Sherbini, 20, in April's World Championship final, won 12-10 11-6 in the season-ending event.
"I'm happy with the way I played. It's always nice to turn the result over," said 32-year-old Massaro.
She will face Egyptian Raneem El Welily, who beat Malaysia's Nicol David 11-5 8-11 11-8, in Saturday's final.
Meanwhile, England's Nick Matthew, the three-time world champion, said he is looking forward to a summer of intense training before the 2016-17 campaign.
"I've not had that for a couple of years," said the 35-year-old. "If I do, I believe I have another good season left in me."
Matthew, who was playing in his first event since recovering from an ankle injury, lost his opening two group matches in Dubai before beating world number one Mohamed Elshorbagy in a dead rubber on Thursday.
