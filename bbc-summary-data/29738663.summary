The Bury-born defender began his career with the Shakers, playing 158 times for his hometown club before moving to Dale in 2007.
Kennedy, 29, returned to Spotland for a third spell in August on a short-term deal, but has made just five starts.
He has also played for Leicester, Peterborough and Barnsley.
"Tom brings a leadership quality and a quality in terms of some of the best passing this league will see," manager David Flitcroft told the club website.
"He's a character that, at times away from home, we have been missing and he adds value to the squad.
"He's the ultimate professional and is desperate to play. He's a fantastic signing for us and, as a left sided player, he will balance the squad out."
