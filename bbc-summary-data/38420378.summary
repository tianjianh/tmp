Allardyce, who kept Sunderland in the Premier League last season, is in talks with Palace about replacing Alan Pardew, who was sacked on Thursday.
Millen said he did not know for certain who would succeed Pardew, but suggested Allardyce, 62, would be good option.
"If it is Sam, Palace are getting an experienced manager," he said.
"Certainly for players he is an experienced Premier League manager. He did a great job keeping Sunderland up."
Allardyce saved the Wearsiders from relegation last season despite them being second from bottom when he joined in October 2015.
He has been out of work since leaving his role as England manager by mutual consent after 67 days and just one game, in the wake of a Daily Telegraph investigation.
Millen, who will be in charge of the Boxing Day game at Watford, has spoken to Pardew since his dismissal.
The former Newcastle boss was sacked with the club 17th in the Premier League after a run of one win in 11 games.
"We have exchanged text messages," added Millen.
"He is upset, disappointed but proud of what he has done here. Unfortunately the results have not been good enough."
