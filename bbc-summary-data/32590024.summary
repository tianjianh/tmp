Election 2015: Final day of campaigning in Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Politicians are embarking on a final, frenetic day of campaigning across Wales before polling day on Thursday.

David Cameron has visited Powys on his third campaign trip to Wales as part of a 36-hour tour of Britain, while First Minister Carwyn Jones leads Labour's last efforts in the Vale of Glamorgan.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood will visit Carmarthen, where her party won its first seat 50 years ago.
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams will travel across mid Wales.
Mr Cameron's return to Wales comes almost three weeks after he launched the Welsh Conservative manifesto in Builth Wells, Powys.
He visited a farm at Talgarth, near Brecon, early on Wednesday morning, where he discussed bovine TB and rural broadband with residents.
The prime minister told the BBC the election was "obviously a close contest" that would go "down to the wire".
Beginning his last push for votes on Tuesday, Mr Cameron said only a Conservative government could keep the UK moving forward, warning of the "chaos" of a Labour government supported by the SNP.
With opinion polls indicating no single party will win a majority of seats at Westminster, Ms Wood will say on Wednesday the "stranglehold of the old parties" is now at an end.
"I want the strongest possible team of Plaid Cymru MPs so that I have the strongest possible hand when I go up to London on Friday to make Wales' voice heard loud and clear," she will say.
"The old way is on its way, let's make sure Wales is part of the change that's coming."
Ms Williams has called for a vote for "unity, stability and decency" in a hung parliament with the Lib Dems.
"Speaking to people, it is clear that they are worried about the influence the SNP will have over Labour - this will lead to more borrowing and debt," she said.
"Others are worried that UKIP will soon be dictating terms to the Tories - cutting our vital public services. For those people, our message is clear: the only party that will ensure stability is the Liberal Democrats."
Mr Jones's Vale of Glamorgan visit comes a week after Labour leader Ed Miliband was in Barry, promising an extra Â£350m for Wales from new taxes within the first year of his party taking power.
Mr Miliband said the longer-term picture would depend on the results of a spending review once Labour settled into office, and the party's "broad approach" was to have "fair" taxes, cut the deficit, and "balance the books".
