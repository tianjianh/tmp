The figure includes the £31.1m raised on Children in Need night last November as well as donations that came in after the televised charity event.
Last year's total is up from the £43.3m raised in 2012 and £46.1m in 2011.
Children in Need host Sir Terry Wogan said he was "amazed by the generosity" of the British public, especially as 2013 was "far from an easy year".
Sir Terry, who is also the charity's life president, added: "When we hosted the first televised appeal in 1980, we were delighted with the £1m raised.
"I don't think any of us could have dreamed how far it would come."
Children in Need, which is the BBC's UK corporate charity, has now raised more than £740m since it began.
The money raised from the 2013 campaign has helped 450,000 disadvantaged children and young people in the UK, the charity said.
This year's telethon will take place on 14 November.
