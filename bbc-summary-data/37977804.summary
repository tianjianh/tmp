On Wednesday, the organisation is to hold its first conference.
The event in Oban will focus on current and future uses for Scottish seaweed in the food and drink industry.
But the association said there was also growing interest in the plantlife as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals and personal care products.
Seaweed is harvested in a number of areas of Scotland.
On the Western Isles, sugar kelp is gathered by hand for making Isle of Harris Gin.
The Hebridean Seaweed Company on Lewis harvests and processes seaweed for use in skincare and other products.
Five years ago, mapping was done to establish the best resources of knotted wrack could be found in the Western Isles.
Lewis was identified as offering the largest quantities of the seaweed.
North Uist had the next highest percentage of knotted wrack for harvesting, followed by South Uist and Harris.
