The 23-year-old seamer, who was booed on his return for Pakistan in January after serving a five-year ban for spot-fixing, finished with figures of 3-27.
Amir removed Dwayne Bravo, Zohaib Khan and Kevon Cooper in the second game of the inaugural Twenty20 tournament.
Karachi chased 126 to win by seven wickets with 4.1 overs to spare after Chris Gayle made six in Lahore's 125-8.
Amir was released from prison in 2012 after serving half of a six-month sentence for his part in a spot-fixing scam also involving Pakistan team-mates Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif against England at Lord's in 2010.
