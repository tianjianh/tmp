A criminal investigation into an inmate's three-day rooftop protest at Manchester Prison has been launched.

Convicted killer Stuart Horner, 35, began his protest on Sunday before it finally came to an end at 03:00 BST on Wednesday.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) confirmed detectives would be gathering evidence relating to the protest and the damage caused to the prison.
Police are working with Prison Service investigators.
Security arrangements are being reviewed at the jail, which is still widely known by its former name of Strangeways.
Staff are scrutinising how Horner was able to scale an 18ft (5.5m) wall in the exercise yard and get onto the roof.
While the protest was ongoing the Prison Service said 60 inmates were transferred to other jails as a result of damage caused by Horner, who smashed windows.
Metal roof trusses were pulled up at the Victorian jail and used to smash a series of large skylight windows and attack CCTV security cameras.
Horner was jailed for life in 2012 for killing his uncle following a family feud.
HMP Manchester was extensively rebuilt after the 25-day Strangeways riot in 1990, in which two people died and hundreds were injured.
