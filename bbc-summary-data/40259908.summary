Det Insp Mark Hopkinson, who is leading the investigation, said: "This was an extremely serious incident and our thoughts are with the family at this very difficult time.
"We realise that emotions are running high in the local community.
"We have one individual in custody and we are progressing several lines of inquiry. We are working closely with the family."
Specialist investigators were drafted in to work on the inquiry.
Mr Hopkinson added: "We would strongly urge people to refrain from making threats and accusations which could constitute offences in themselves, and much worse, if inaccurate, could undermine any investigation or even court proceedings in future.
"If you have seen something or heard something, please speak to our community teams on the ground."
