Pivac's side leapfrogged Ospreys to third in the Pro12 after the Blues beat them in the first Judgement Day game.
Scarlets' hopes of finishing in the top four also benefitted from Munster defeating fifth place Ulster.
"We were happy with the results. We were supporting Munster and the Blues and the results went our way," he said.
Pivac says they struggled to defeat the Dragons, however, with second-half tries from Wales pair Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies proving pivotal.
"We weren't happy with our performance. We were beaten in the first-half in the collisions. They slowed our ball down turned a lot over and played very well in that area," he continued.
"We couldn't get a foothold in the game in that first 40. We were happy with a couple of tries in the second-half and played a lot more rugby."
Meanwhile, Newport Gwent Dragons director of rugby Kingsley Jones praised his side's efforts in their losing cause, highlighting their 10 minutes with 14 men after Adam Hughes' sin-binning as the period which "broke their spirit".
Jones hopes their losing bonus point - earned with Hughes' last-minute try - can help them finish the season in ninth place in the Pro12.
"We want to finish above Edinburgh. It has been a tough season - it has not been a great season, we know that," said Jones.
"We've been 10th for many seasons and there's an opportunity still, with a disappointing season, to finish in ninth.
"Against the Blues we fancy our chances. They've been exceptional today and they're a decent team but we fancy our chances and Edinburgh are in the same boat as us.
"We've got to believe we can go there and win, bring that intensity and belief again. That's the challenge for this group.
"Losing is not acceptable and it's not great but, ultimately, I couldn't ask for much more."
