Garda officer arrested over media disclosure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior Garda (Irish police) officer has been arrested as part of an investigation into the unlawful disclosure of information to the media.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The officer was arrested on Thursday morning after he was suspected of breaching the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na Act.
The investigation began last year following a report by the former children's ombudsman Emily Logan.
The report was into the police removal of two children from their families in Athlone and Dublin in October 2013.
The children were subsequently returned to their families.
The report found that while the Health Service Executive could not be ruled out, the release of details in relation to one of the children probably came from someone within the police and may have been an offence.
RTÃ‰ News has reported that the officer is the most senior Garda officer ever to have been arrested as part of a criminal investigation.
He was arrested after he arrived at a County Dublin police station by appointment at 07:30 on Thursday.
The investigation is being led by a chief superintendent and a detective superintendent based in Dublin city centre.
The office of the officer has been searched and his phone and computer records examined.
