Most of the Premier League deals done in this transfer window have been by teams near the foot of the table.
Newcastle spent £12m on both Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend, while Bournemouth spent £16m in total on strikers Benik Afobe from Wolves and Lewis Grabban from Norwich.
Struggling Sunderland and Norwich have made five signings each, while Southampton and Watford were perhaps thinking about a push for a European place when they brought in Charlie Austin and Nordin Amrabat respectively.
As for Liverpool, their fans will no doubt hope for more arrivals following the on-loan capture of defender Steven Caulker.
Chelsea are the wildcard in the middle. Will Brazil forward Alexandre Pato and USA defender Matt Miazga improve Guus Hiddink's squad? The Blues have already sold Brazil midfielder Ramires to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning for £25m.
Meanwhile, Crystal Palace might have grabbed the freebie of the winter with the signing of former Arsenal, Manchester City and Spurs striker Emmanuel Adebayor.
Teams at the top end have yet to twist. Arsenal spent a modest £5m on Mohamed Elneny from Basel, while Leicester paid Birmingham £3.7m for bright midfield prospect Demarai Gray.
It is make or break day for many clubs during what has been a closely fought Premier League season.
For the sides at the wrong end of the table, there is extra significance, given that £99m is guaranteed for each top-flight club next season as a result of the new £5.1bn TV rights deal.
From Newcastle's bid for West Brom's Saido Berahino to Liverpool's pursuit of Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Alex Teixeira, BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty has identified 10 men who could still make a last-minute move.
Stay across the BBC on Monday for news on all the deals and near misses - it promises to be a fascinating day.
Here are the dates and times for when the respective windows will shut across Europe. Odds on a club leaving it too late?
