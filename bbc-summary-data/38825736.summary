Jamie Mines, from Frome, was injured at Kendrick Industrial Estate, Swindon, in December.
He was placed in the induced coma while being treated at the intensive care unit at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
His friend Ian Kennedy said he "is continuing to impress his medical team with his progress".
On Tuesday, he wrote on Facebook: "He is starting to work with the rehabilitation team and is proving very determined."
Mr Kennedy set up a fundraising page with an initial target of £20,000, but after Mr Mines' second hand was amputated, it was raised to £100,000.
So far, well-wishers have donated more than £75,000 to the fund.
Mr Kennedy said Mr Mines "knows how much support he has and has seen a lot of the video messages".
Mr Mines is a semi-professional footballer who plays for Frome Town, Radstock, Larkhall and Paulton football clubs.
He missed his first Christmas with his five-month-old twins Isabella and Savannah as a result of the accident.
The Health and Safety Executive is investigating.
