Former Manchester United trainee Lee, 30, has played in over 350 games for the club since joining in 2008.
The Spireites are short on cover in the goalkeeper department, following Aaron Chapman's move to Accrington Stanley last month.
"He may not start the season, so we may need two goalkeepers to come in," manager Danny Wilson said.
