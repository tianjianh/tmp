Astle, who scored 174 goals in 361 games for the club, netted the winner as Albion beat Everton 1-0 at Wembley.
The kit will be part of 'Astle Day' where his family will launch a foundation to help sufferers and research of the brain condition which caused his death in 2002.
The England cap was 59 when he died.

The condition - chronic traumatic encephalopathy - is usually linked to boxing.
And Astle's family have been lobbying the Football Association to introduce new laws on head injuries in amateur football.
Albion will wear shirts numbered 2-11, with a blank goalkeeping jersey to mirror the one worn by John Osborne at Wembley.
It will be the second time the Premier League has granted permission for a kit change following Manchester United's switch to a retro design for the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster in 2008.
