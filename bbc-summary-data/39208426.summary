Bumblebees' smelly feet trick

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scientists from the University of Bristol say that they've discovered a clever trick that bumblebees use to help each other find the best food.

They leave "smelly footprints" behind on the plants that they've already eaten from, so that other bees know whether it's a good source of food.
For example, the invisible, smelly markers can let other bees know if a flower is full of good food.
Or it could signal that the food has already all been eaten.
Researchers said that bees can also tell the difference between footprints left by themselves, their family, or strangers.
Clever bees!
