Yorkshire's "stunning coastline" has inspired a show garden set to be unveiled at the Chelsea Flower Show.

The plot will feature cliffs, a beach and a ruined abbey made from stone from the same quarry used to build Whitby Abbey in the 13th Century.
Material with the same geological composition as Flamborough Head will be used to make the cliffs in the garden.
Welcome To Yorkshire said "every inch of the garden will be authentically Yorkshire".
Plants, flowers and herbs used in the garden will be those which grow in and around the coastline of the historic county.
Tracy Foster, who has designed the garden on behalf of the tourism body, said planning it had been "a pure pleasure".
The Sheffield artist, whose studio is in Leeds, said: "I'm fascinated by how the geology and geography of an area influences the species that grow there, wildlife that lives there, what can be farmed here and how the whole character of the landscape has developed throughout history."
The Chelsea Flower Show takes place in London between May 22-27.
