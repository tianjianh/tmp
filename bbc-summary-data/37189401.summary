The 28-year-old Dutchman joined the Championship club in summer 2014 and had one year remaining on his deal at the Amex Stadium.
Holla has played twice in the EFL Cup this season but only featured four times for the Seagulls in 2015-16.
"Danny has found his chances very limited, and that situation is unlikely to change," boss Chris Hughton said.
"It hasn't really worked out as Danny or the club had hoped."
