Higgins recorded breaks of 104 and 103 and levelled the match three times.
But Welshman Day clinched his place in the quarter-finals by sinking a final-frame black for a 4-3 win in Llandudno.
"It was a bit of an awkward clearance, which I managed to hold myself together and make it through. It was an enjoyable match to be involved in and one I'm pleased to win," said Day.
