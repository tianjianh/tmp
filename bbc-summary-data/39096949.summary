Football League Division One: Donegal hold Dubs as Monaghan win in Kerry to go top

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Michael Murphy's injury-time point earned Donegal a 2-5 to 1-8 draw against Dublin as Monaghan beat Kerry 2-8 to 1-10 to go top of Division One.

Dublin were well worth their 0-5 to 0-2 lead at Ballybofey but two goals in a minute from Jason McGee and Ryan McHugh put Donegal ahead at half-time.
Niall Scully's goal helped Dublin fight back from four down to lead but Murphy's late score meant a draw.
Jack McCarron and Gavin Doogan hit Monaghan's goals in Killarney.
Monaghan's victory moves them on to five points in Division One as they lead both Mayo and Dublin by a point.
It was 14-man Kerry's second home defeat of the campaign as they had Bryan Sheehan sent off late in the game.
David Moran's Kerry goal wiped out Monaghan's early lead and the Kingdom led by five at one stage before McCarron's three-pointer, as he finished to the net after Brendan Kealy had saved a Conor McManus shot, got the visitors back in touch.
After trailing 1-5 to 1-3 at half-time, Doogan's goal was the crucial Monaghan score in the second half as Conor McManus struck two long-range scores.
Kerry hit the last two scores to reduce Monaghan's advantage to the minimum but Monaghan held on to repeat their away win over the Kingdom two years ago.
For the second time in a fortnight, Dublin had to be content with a draw against Ulster opposition as Donegal showed great resolve to increase their unbeaten run of Ballybofey games to 16.
The draw also extended Dublin's extraordinary unbeaten run in championship and league to 32 games after an entertaining, if low-scoring contest.
Four unanswered points, including two from Dean Rock, helped the Dubs take apparent control at 0-5 to 0-2 ahead but McGee's sidefooted finished levelled the contest on 32 minutes before McHugh scrambled a second goal within 33 seconds.
A Murphy free extended Donegal's lead to four after half-time but two Rock frees and Scully's goal after a brilliant sweeping move had the Dubs ahead by the 54th minute.
Dublin looked the likely winners as sub Davy Byrne added another score on 62 minutes but Ciaran Thompson's second successful free and Murphy's late placed ball - which looked a soft decision - earned Donegal a draw.
