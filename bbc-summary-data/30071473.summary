The 13 best things Bob Geldof told us at the Band Aid 30 recording

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Never one to hold back, Bob Geldof seemed relaxed, tired but happily in control of the bunch of artists he'd summoned for Band Aid 30.

They included the likes of One Direction, Rita Ora, Olly Murs, Chris Martin, Sam Smith, Bono and Ellie Goulding.
His one-liners kept coming throughout the day as the musicians recorded the fourth version of Do They Know It's Christmas?
So here are some of Bob's best bits...
On One Direction singing the opening lines to the song: "It's beautiful. I mean seriously. I never expected that from them. It's very moody the start, and they just come sort of whispering in. It's great."
"Ellie (Goulding) and Sam (Smith) and the 1D guys, they grew up having to sing this song at their nativity plays you know."
When we asked Bob about the changed lyrics reflecting the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, such as Bono's re-vamped line: "How do you know that? Oh [mumbles and swears] it's supposed to be a [swears] surprise."
"There will be a fight over the Bono line, because it's become a 'thing'. I said to Chris Martin, 'do you want to do the Bono line?' and he said 'no'. And I said 'well come on man you've got to step up' and he said 'I'm not doing that, that belongs to him' and I said 'I've changed it' and he said 'it still belongs to him!'"
And after Bono had recorded 'that' line, how was it? "Mega."
Why the song will get played on The X Factor results show but we won't be able to buy the download until Monday morning: "Because it's technical.
"We'll have a rough edit on The X Factor and we'll have a rough edit of the film. Simon [Cowell], not many people know, but he always joins in on these things.
"He called me and said 'do you want five minutes on The X Factor?' Yes! So it may not be the finished single."
"Tracey Emin was coming down but she saw on the news you lot [the press] and said 'forget it'."
"Bastille gave up two stadium shows in America to fly back and we don't give them a penny. Not an airfare, not a coffee, not a telephone call. They're here because they really want to be here."
Sir Bob had asked Adele to join the track, so how come she's not on it?
"She's not doing anything. It's not this, not a record, it's not writing, it's not interviews, nothing. I put the call in, I didn't speak to her."
And Jake Bugg wanted to sing on Band Aid 30 but: "He said yes, but then couldn't do it because he's got a gig in Rio today."
"They're amazing artists, you may not like them, you might not like the track, it doesn't matter. This thing is an event. You can be part of the event and turn it into an phenomenon."
"Don't do any of the free stuff [music streaming], it's nonsense. Pay for it."
"The truth is, it'll be number one at 8am [on Monday]."
