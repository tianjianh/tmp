Kurtley Beale: Wasps boss Dai Young keen to extend back's stay

Wasps are keen to retain Australia outside-back Kurtley Beale beyond his existing contract, says director of rugby Dai Young.

Former Waratahs three-quarter Beale, 28, who has 12 tries in 60 Tests for the Wallabies, joined the Premiership side on an initial one-season deal.
He has scored three tries in six league games since, including two in Saturday's 24-3 win at Bath.
"We're expecting a decision over the next week," Young said.
"There's quite a lot for him to think about - whether he wants another season in the Premiership or go back to Australia. I'm sure he has plenty of options to consider."
Despite an injury suffered in the 2016 Super Rugby season delaying his debut for the Coventry-based club, Beale has helped Wasps climb to the top of the Premiership and reach the quarter-finals of the European Champions Cup.
The removal of the restriction around selecting non-Australia based players for the 2015 Rugby World Cup helped overseas-based Wallabies stars such as Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell extend their international careers while playing abroad.
Conveniently, Beale would qualify for the rule which could work in Wasps' favour.
"It was always agreed that we see how this season goes and how he and his girlfriend settle in," Young added. "He's got his international career to think about.
"If it ends up being a year, it's a year we wouldn't have changed. If we can extend it, which we are hoping to do, we'll be really pleased. If we can't, it will have been a worthwhile exercise."
