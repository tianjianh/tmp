The bodies of Tim Newton, 27, and Rachel Slater, 24, who both lived in Bradford, were found on Britain's highest mountain in March, five weeks after they went missing.
On Saturday, a service of remembrance was held in Tim's hometown of Hinckley in Leicestershire.
Tim and Rachel were buried side-by-side in Glen Nevis at a private funeral.
The couple were last seen on 15 February and are thought to have been caught in an avalanche on the north face of Ben Nevis.
At the memorial service, his brother Ed Newton gave what he hoped would have been a future best man's speech.
"The beautiful thing about Tim was not that he was intelligent or that he always won, but it was the grace, the kindness and modesty that he had in his achievements," he told the celebration.
"In fact I know that right now he would be digging me in the ribs, telling us to stop. He would be embarrassed at us bragging about all he has accomplished."
Mr Newton told the hundreds of mourners about his brother's successes as a climber, leading exhibitions on Everest, K2, El Capitan in Yosemite and more.
The former Twycross House School pupil had trained as an actor before qualifying as a mountain leader and, more recently, studying physics at The University of Manchester.
It was there that he met Ms Slater, with whom he shared a passion for climbing.
The Reverand Gary Weston, who led the service at St John's Church, said: "It is a tragedy - a young life that shouldn't have been lost right now. But he has done so much and we just want to give thanks to God in front of his family for all that he has done and celebrate him as an individual."
Mr Newton said his brother packed more into 27 years than most could hope to in 100.
