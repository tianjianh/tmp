Richard Bracken, 48, went missing from Bryn y Neuadd hospital, Llanfairfechan, Conwy county, last month.
He was convicted of the murder of Gwynedd vicar Canon Alun Jones in 1982.
Health officials used the meeting to explain their procedures at the unit.
Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Sandeep Mathews, from Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said that any decision to allow such leave is taken by the Ministry of Justice and is continuously assessed by clinical staff.
Health board medical director Prof Matt Makin has previously said that the board would be "learning from this incident".
