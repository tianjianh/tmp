The 500lb device was discovered 2.5 nautical miles from the coast, about 8m below the surface.
Divers conducting a survey for the construction of the new power station found the ordnance on Monday.
It was destroyed in a controlled explosion at about 15:00 BST on Tuesday.
The "unusual" ordnance was found off Lilstock Range, just west from Steart point and Bridgwater in Somerset.
The coast around Lilstock was used as part of a practice bombing range for the Royal Navy.
Latest on the operation to destroy the bomb in the Bristol Channel.
HM Coastguard said it first received a warning yesterday and advised vessels in the area to keep clear.
The Royal Navy Bomb Squad based at Devonport naval base was called in and a 1km exclusion zone was set up.
EDF Energy said its team of divers made the discovery 8m below the surface while checking the seabed ahead of the construction of the main cooling water tunnels for new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station being built.
David Eccles from EDF said: "We have put a cordon zone around the area and are working closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Royal Navy."
