[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 2-0 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Collins scored a second-half brace as Sutton returned to winning ways with a National League victory over 10-man Aldershot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts went into the match on the back of a six-match winless run in the league which had seen them drop down to 13th in the standings, but bounced back in style from Tuesday's defeat at Boreham Wood.
Gary Waddock's visitors were reduced to 10 men when Jake Gallagher was shown a straight red card just before the break after going into a tackle with Bedsente Gomis, his opponent seeming to come off worse.
The U's took advantage after 58 minutes as Collins headed home the opener before netting his sixth goal this season as he picked up Kevin Amankwaah's cross from the left and fired past Mark Smith to seal the points with 10 minutes remaining.
