An inquest into the death of a four-year-old boy hit by a car outside a leisure centre has been opened.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnaby Cork was out with his family when he was struck outside the Thame Leisure Centre in Oxfordshire at 10:30 GMT on 10 December.
Despite attempts to revive him, he died on his way to hospital in air ambulance, the Oxford court heard.
Oxfordshire Coroner Darren Salter said it was a "tragic case" and adjourned the inquest until 23 March.
Barnaby's father Stefan has set up an online fundraising page to raise money for the Thames Valley Air Ambulance and has raised more than Â£27,700 so far.
