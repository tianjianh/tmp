The Algeria international, 21, moved to White Hart Lane as a teenager, making his first-team debut in December 2013.
He has made 66 appearances for Spurs but has not featured for Mauricio Pochettino's side this season.
"I first learned of Schalke's interest six weeks ago and have been hoping since then that the transfer would be completed," said Bentaleb.
Schalke, who finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season, are also close to signing Bentaleb's former Spurs team-mate Benjamin Stambouli from French champions Paris St-Germain.
The 26-year-old Frenchman played for the Premier League club in 2014-15 before joining PSG last summer and helping them win a domestic treble.
