[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Former Manchester City striker Dzeko has now scored seven times this season to become the league's leading scorer.
Dzeko, 30, slotted Roma ahead following a mistake by Kalidou Koulibaly and made it 2-0 when he headed in following a 54th-minute free-kick.
Koulibaly headed a goal back but Mohamed Salah sealed victory late on.
Edin Dzeko has enjoyed a superb start to the season.
After scoring just eight league goals last season, the Bosnia and Herzegovina international has seven in eight games this time around.
But Roma coach Luciano Spalletti believes he could have added even further to his tally in the fixture known as the 'Derby del Sole'.
Spalletti said: "He scored twice, but if you ask me he can score more if he just showed a little more fighting spirit, and was more clinical.
"In the opening half he had four or five chances to hurt Napoli. For a player with his physical and technical skills, he can do much better."
