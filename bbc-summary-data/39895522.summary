[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover Athletic have signed striker Jamie Allen from Southport for an undisclosed fee, on a two-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old scored 10 goals for the Sandgrounders this season, but could not prevent their relegation from the National League.
He began his career with Fleetwood and played for them in the Football League before joining Southport in 2015.
Allen's arrival fills the gap left by top scorer Ricky Miller, who joined Peterborough United earlier this month.
