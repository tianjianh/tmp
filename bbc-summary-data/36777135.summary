Inverness CT have signed former Aberdeen and Cardiff full-back Kevin McNaughton and taken winger Billy King on a season-long loan from Hearts.

McNaughton, 33, has agreed a one-year deal following his summer release from Wigan.
A broken leg and a serious hamstring injury have limited the former Scotland international to just 12 appearances over the past two seasons.
King, 22, spent the second half of last term on loan at Rangers.
He scored on his Ibrox debut but did not find the net again in 12 more outings for the Championship winners.
The left-sided player made 20 appearances for Hearts in the first stretch of the campaign, netting twice.
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson told the club's official website: "I believe this is a great move for Billy and will enable him to kick on and get some regular football under his belt.
"He returned from his loan at Rangers earlier this summer and, having spoken to him, he expressed a desire to get as much game time as possible.
"There is a lot of competition for places here and I feel Billy will stand a better chance of playing regularly by going back out on loan."
McNaughton, capped four times for Scotland, began his career at Aberdeen before moving on to Cardiff in 2006.
His nine-year career at the Bluebirds involved two loan spells at Bolton.
