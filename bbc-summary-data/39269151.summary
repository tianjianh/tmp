Brighton defender Shane Duffy is focusing on a return to action in late April after surgery on a foot injury.

Duffy, 25, fractured a metatarsal during the 3-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest on 4 March and was given a six-week recovery time.
"That's quite good for these kind of injuries. I don't want to rush it," Duffy told BBC Sussex.
"The next two weeks are probably the most important, then I can start cracking on with my fitness again."
The injury also ruled him out of the Republic of Ireland's World Cup qualifier against Wales and the home friendly with Iceland at the end of March.
However, after having the operation to heal the injury, Duffy hopes to be back for the closing weeks of the campaign as Brighton push for promotion to the Premier League.
He said: "They put a screw into my metatarsal, so hopefully that'll quicken the healing a bit. Six weeks is probably the earliest I will be back.
"It's an exciting time. These are the vital games that you want to be involved in."
Duffy is one of a number of Brighton defenders out of action.
Fellow centre-back Connor Goldson is out for the rest of the season with a heart issue, left-backs Gaetan Bong (knee), Sebastien Pocognoli (groin) and Sam Adekugbe (hamstring) are all injured, while skipper Bruno - who this week signed a new deal - is a doubt for Saturday's trip to Leeds with a groin problem.
