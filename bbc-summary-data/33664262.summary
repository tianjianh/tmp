When the musician returned to pick up the vehicle after nearly two hours, the attendant said he had given it to someone else thinking he was the owner.
The incident happened in a Manhattan garage on the evening of 16 July and is being treated as theft.
The DJ said the missing Dodge Charger had contained valuable vintage records.
Grandmaster Flash, 57, whose real name is Joseph Saddler, tweeted that the attendant "gave the car to somebody that was dressed like me, minus the Pumas".
Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were at the forefront of developing hip-hop with their celebrated album The Message in 1982 and the hit White Lines.
They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.
