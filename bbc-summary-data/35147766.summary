Preston North End 1-0 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Gallagher's goal gave Preston victory over a poor Hull City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had the better of the first half, but Adam Reach, Joe Garner and Will Keane all failed to test Tigers keeper Allan McGregor when well-placed.
Gallagher gave Preston a deserved lead when he swept home from Daniel Johnson's free-kick after the break.
The Tigers, who have not won away from home since 3 November, struggled for any kind of rhythm and could easily have lost by more.
The defeat, coupled with Middlesbrough's win over Sheffield Wednesday, means Hull are now three points outside the top two having played a game more.
Preston, who are now seven points clear of the bottom three, should have taken an early lead when Reach fired over from inside the area before striker Garner wasted an equally presentable opportunity.
Keane then saw a low shot fly just wide of the post as the hosts completely dominated the first half.
The Tigers brought on former England international Tom Huddlestone at the break and the midfielder forced a save from Jordan Pickford almost immediately.
However, they found themselves behind in the 66th minute when Johnson rolled a free-kick across the area and the unmarked Gallagher slotted past McGregor.
Steve Bruce's side thought they had secured a point in the last second from a goalmouth scramble but the officials ruled the ball had not crossed the line.
Preston boss Simon Grayson:
"I've seen on the TV replays that it's not over the line. John Welsh has made a great clearance and we're fortunate because sometimes them decisions go against you.
"But it's the right decision, we've probably earned the luck today that we've not had over the last couple of weeks, like with the goalkeeper being sent off at Leeds a few weeks ago.
"It's the right decision, a clear decision and a decision we are grateful (for)."
Hull boss Steve Bruce:

"We needed a break when you're not playing well, like we didn't. We found it very difficult today and, to be fair, away from home it is too often that we're not performing anywhere near the level we're capable of.
"It is three successive defeats and if you're going to win leagues or win titles then we've got to eradicate that quickly because it's not a great trait to have.
"Unfortunately, the linesman has got a horrible decision with an offside and a horrible decision which he has got to see that (the ball crossed the line), even though he is 50 yards away.
"The reaction of all the players tells you it is over the line. They've got away with it."
