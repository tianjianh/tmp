Greece striker Apostolos Vellios is determined to make the most of his "second chance" in English football after joining Nottingham Forest.

The 24-year-old previously had a three-and-a-half-year spell at Everton, making just two Premier League starts.
Vellios, signed by Forest from Iraklis, told BBC Radio Nottingham: "When I was 18 I came here and for three and a half years it was a little bit hard for me.
"Now it's like a second chance. I really wanted to come back here."
He won the first of his three international caps in March when he was called up for Greece's friendly game against Iceland.
Vellios' previous spell in England also included a brief stay on loan at Blackpool, where he managed just two appearances.
But he is confident that experience will stand him in good stead and that he will succeed this time around.
He said: "I was young and now I feel I have a bit more experience. I feel completely different.
"Everton was like a school for me, because I came here young and learned a lot. Now I think it's going to be easier to be part of an English team.
"It wasn't a hard decision. It was an easy decision. I like the way we train here, I like the weather here - it's football weather - and I like everything in England."
