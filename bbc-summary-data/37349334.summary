[SN]TITLE[SN]
Edinburgh landlord threatened tenants over bills

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man, who was struck off Edinburgh city council's Landlords' Register for threatening tenants, has been ordered to perform 250 hours of unpaid work.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Fortune, 47, a prisoner in Saughton, was also ordered to pay Â£2,425 compensation to his victims.
The offences happened between February 2011 and April 2016.
He had pled guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to two charges of threatening people with violence, one of assault and four of obtaining money by fraud.
He also admitted charges of sending threatening emails and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Fortune was brought back to Scotland from France in April this year on a European arrest warrant on the most recent offences.
He was taken off the register in 2013 after being fined Â£650 for threatening tenants in Lonsdale Terrace, Edinburgh, when they insisted he pay for minor repairs to the property.
Sheriff Kenneth McGowan was told the victims of the phone threats were a solicitor at HBJ Gateley Wareing, a firm involved in pursuing council tax arrears against Fortune, and the rector of Edinburgh Academy.
Defence solicitor, Tom Bannigan, told Sheriff McGowan that his client had been under tremendous stress at the time.
"He was upset and angry", he said. "There was a property recession and people were asking for their money and this had caused financial difficulties.
"His business was collapsing around him and he behaved in a totally irrational way".
Mr Bannigan added that the social work report recommended a community-based sentence.
Sheriff McGowan told Fortune it was with "considerable hesitation" that he would deal with the matter by a community payback order.
The Crown is expected to take action under the proceeds of crime legislation.
