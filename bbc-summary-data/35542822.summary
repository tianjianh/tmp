Crossmaglen led 0-3 to 0-0 and 0-8 to 0-3 before Castlebar cut the margin to only three points at half-time after Cross missed a number of great chances.
Castlebar levelled at 0-8 to 0-8 and while Cross moved ahead again, the Mayo side were beginning to take control.
Barry Moran's 58th-minute point proved the winner as tempers flared late on.
Cross were the dominant force in the opening 25 minutes and were never behind until Neil Douglas' 52nd-minute point.
Aaron Kernan's free levelled the game again at 0-12 four minutes later before Moran chipped over the winner from close range.
An ugly scuffle broke out in front of the Castlebar dugout as several Cross players were prevented from retrieving the ball and going in search of an equaliser.
The Armagh giants were the better side in the first half with Jamie Clarke sparkling with three first-half points.
Just before the break, Ray O'Malley blocked Johnny Murtagh's goal-bound shot on the line, after goalkeeper Rory Byrne was caught off his line.
Within three minutes of the restart,  Patrick Durkan, Neil Lydon and Danny Kirby kicked points from play to level the contest.
Paul McKeown picked up a black card with Crossmaglen reeling as the points rained over.
Douglas missed the resulting chance to put Castlebar ahead for the first time.
Cross managed to fend off Castlebar's attack for a few more blows, Stephen Kernan, Clarke and O'Neill putting them ahead on three occasions, but each time the Mayo champions responded before Moran's late winner.
The Armagh club's supporters were infuriated with a number of referee Eddie Kinsella's decisions in the closing stages although the neutral verdict was that the Laois whistler had done more right than wrong during the game.
