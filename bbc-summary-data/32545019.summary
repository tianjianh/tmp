The Bureau of Meteorology warned of strong winds, heavy surf and the possibility of flash floods.
The Queensland Premier Annastacia Palasczuk advised people to stay indoors if they could.
The bad weather comes barely a week since storms battered New South Wales, killing four people.
The bureau warned of winds peaking at 100km/h (62mph) on Friday night along the coast.
The weather is expected to intensify as it moves south, before moving off the coast on Sunday.
Friday's rugby league test match between Australia and New Zealand was called off hours before kick off.
The game was rescheduled for Sunday. It is the first time since 1948 that a league match has been postponed because of weather.
Ten dams operated by Seqwater in southeast Queensland are spilling over, the water agency said.
Massive flooding struck areas in and around Brisbane in 2011, with 38 people killed and more than  30,000 properties swamped.
Then, the authorities faced questions about why waters in the Wivenhoe dam, west of Brisbane, were not reduced in preparation for the flooding.
The dam was 98% full on Friday. Seqwater said it was monitoring levels and that it would likely release water from Wivenhoe and another dam on Friday night or Saturday morning, according to the Queensland Times.
