Football League: Five things you may have missed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A full programme of Football League fixtures returned on Saturday following the international break and there was no shortage of headlines across the three divisions.

Hat-tricks by half-time, a caretaker managerial debut to dream of and a familiar face back on the scoresheet with his hometown club, BBC Sport picks out some of the day's headlines.
Birmingham 4-2 Bristol City
Reading striker Orlando Sa claimed the honour of the season's first Championship hat-trick as the Royals thumped Ipswich 5-1 at home on Friday.
Not to be outdone, Birmingham's City Clayton Donaldson thought he would get in on the act less than 24 hours later against Bristol City.
Inspired perhaps by Cristiano Ronaldo bagging five for Real Madrid, Donaldson put Blues 2-0 ahead after just 20 minutes.
After City clawed one back, he restored the home side's two-goal cushion from the penalty spot.
The 31-year-old had started every league game this season, but had failed to find the net before Steve Cotterill's side arrived at St Andrew's.
Not a bad afternoon's work.
Middlesbrough 2-0 MK Dons
It was a Championship signing that raised several eyebrows in the summer, England international Stewart Downing returning to his hometown club Middlesbrough from West Ham.
Just as MK Dons looked set to frustrate Aitor Karanka's men at the Riverside, Downing popped up to break the deadlock and bag his first goal of his second spell.
His trusted left foot was the source of this goal as he curled an effort into the bottom corner beyond Dons keeper David Martin.
Fellow summer addition David Nugent wrapped up the points with nine minutes remaining with his first goal for the club.
Oldham 1-5 Peterborough
Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony pressed the sacking button last weekend to bring Dave Robertson's brief stint in charge of the Posh to an end after just one win in the first six matches.
Earlier in the week, MacAnthony claimed he has a four-man shortlist for the position, but he might want to rip it up straightway and give the job to caretaker manager Grant McCann.
The former Northern Ireland international saw his side romp to a 5-1 win at Boundary Park thanks to two goals apiece from Souleymane Coulibaly and Lee Angol.
"I thought they were all superb goals," McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"I said to the players, me being greedy, if we had believed in ourselves we could have got more, but I'll settle for that.
"I didn't single anyone out in the changing room - to a man, we were exceptional.
"They took the messages that I gave to them onto the pitch - they definitely expressed themselves and played with a real freedom. I thought we were very good."
While it may have been a good afternoon for Grant, it proved a decisive one for Oldham manager Darren Kelly.
He parted company with the club shortly after the final whistle.
Yeovil 1-1 AFC Wimbledon
It's not been much fun for Yeovil Town recently. Their physio's treatment table has easily been the busiest location at Huish Park.
Glovers manager Paul Sturrock said he would struggle to fill the substitutes' bench as he named a full team of unavailable outfield players for the visit of AFC Wimbledon.
In fact, he was only able to name five substitutes and soon there was another injury to report. Thankfully not to one of Sturrock's patched-up squad, but this time it was referee Lee Swabey calling for the magic sponge.
Sturrock's Sicknote XI were denied an heroic home win when Adebayo Akinfenwa equalised for Wimbledon with 11 minutes remaining.
Wycombe 1-2 Plymouth
Kick-off can get delayed for all sorts of reasons. Poor weather, traffic congestion around the ground, public safety, but a set of GPS trackers?
Referee Tim Robinson held up the action at Adams Park for six minutes while he sought clarity about vests being worn under the Wycombe players' shirts.
But Mr Robinson was happy to proceed when the club were able to produce a letter authorising their use.
Gareth Ainsworth's side seemed to lose track of each other fairly quickly, though, as Reuben Reid put Argyle ahead after just four minutes.
Plymouth Argyle's Twitter feed joked their former striker and now Chairboys frontman Jason Banton may have been sent down a cul-de-sac by his GPS.
Banton was able to put the joke back on the Pilgrims when he equalised with his first goal for the club.
But Jake Jervis restored the lead for the visitors, who got their revenge on the side which knocked them out of last season's play-offs.
Hopefully the Wycombe players didn't lose their direction on the way home.
