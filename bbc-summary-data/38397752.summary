Irish FA 'will not challenge' Fifa's poppy fine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish Football Association (IFA) has said it will not take legal action over a fine imposed on it by Fifa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Football's world ruling body fined all four UK nations for displaying poppies during World Cup qualifiers around Armistice Day.
A board of the Northern Ireland governing body said the punishment was "extremely disappointing".
"The Irish FA had discussions with Fifa to get guidance on what was permitted within the laws of the game," it said.
"Having followed that guidance in the delivery of the acts of remembrance at the match, it is extremely disappointing that the Fifa disciplinary committee came to the conclusions that it did.
"The Irish FA cannot appeal the 15,000 Sfr (Â£12,000) fine under Fifa regulations, and having discussed the options at the board meeting this evening the association will not pursue any further legal recourse."
But the IFA said it would write to Fifa president Gianni Infantino to "arrange an urgent meeting to seek clarity on this issue".
