Norwich Pride: LGBT parade supported by city crowds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual Pride festival has taken place in Norwich, with groups taking the opportunity to promote the serious side of their work.

Norfolk's gay, lesbian, bi-sexual and trans-gender (LGBT) community event aims to celebrate diversity and give residents an insight into their world.
Thousands of people turned out to watch the parade.
Among those taking part was Broken Rainbow which helps people if they find themselves in abusive relationships.
Amy, one of the organisers of the services, said: "It's very easy to assume because people are in a same sex relationship they will not have the same problems, quote, normal people do.
"We provide online chat support and phone referrals for counselling to offer all the help we can as well as legal advice."
Educate and Celebrate, which visits schools to try to change perceptions about LGBT people, and the Unison Union helping LGBT people who may feel under-represented at work, were also represented at the festival.
Members of the LGBT community took part in the parade from Chapelfield Gardens to the Forum in a variety of colours and costumes.
The event has run since 2009 and is supported by volunteers, the city council, arts venues and businesses.
Venues throughout the city were flying rainbow flags in support of the event.
Shoppers, residents and visitors lined the main streets in the city centre to watch the parade.
