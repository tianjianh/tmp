Gray prevailed 6-0 in the knockout final, with Goubert taking silver.
Hosts Jersey took top honours in the archery compound event, with Great Britain international Lucy O'Sullivan winning gold, while Guernsey's Gen Witham claimed silver.
In the men's recurve head-to-head, Jersey's Mark Renouf took gold, his first ever Island Games medal.
Jersey's Rhys Hidrio battled back after his chain came off to win a silver medal in the mountain bike criterium.
Hidrio, who was fifth in the cross country after suffering a puncture, could not catch the Isle of Man's Nick Corlett who took gold.
Hidrio helped Howard Greenside, Ollie Lowthorpe, James Patterson and Richard Payne to win team silver.
Guernsey's James Roe took the bronze medal while he and his teammates Andrew Colver, Geoffrey Gibson, Michael Serafin and Danny Shaw won team bronze.
Guernsey's 16-year-old rider Megan Downton won her first-ever Island Games medal taking bronze in the women's criterium.
She finished behind Western Isles' Kerry and Kirsty Macphee, who had already won gold and silver in the cross-country.
Jersey's team of Jemima Leach, Catherine Liron and Helene Monpetit won team silver while Downton and Heather Despres teamed up to win bronze.
Jersey schoolgirl Natasha Forrest produced the best performance of her short career to make the semi-finals of the tennis singles at the Island Games.
The 14-year-old, who is the youngest player in the tournament, knocked out the Isle of Man's number two seed Laura Feely 7-6 3-6 10-8 on Wednesday.
Her place in the semi-final guarantees her a bronze medal to add to the team silver she won on Monday.
"I'm feeling amazing, I really didn't expect it," Forrest told BBC Jersey.
Meanwhile, Jersey's men's number one seed Scott Clayton overcame Guernsey's Dom McLuskey 7-6 6-2 to book his place in the last four of the singles.
Guernsey's Pat Ogier beat Jersey's James Connelly in straight sets, 6-3 6-1, in another of the all-Channel Islands quarter-final clashes.
