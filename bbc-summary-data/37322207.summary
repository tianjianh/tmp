[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kiran Carlson became Glamorgan's youngest first-class centurion as the visitors fought back from 34-5 to keep leaders Essex waiting for promotion.

Graham Napier (4-46) starred as the Welsh side lost five wickets for four runs in 21 balls before lunch.
But 18-year-old Carlson (101 not out) led Glamorgan's recovery as they reached 256-7 at stumps, and left Essex needing four more points to go up.
The teenager put on 129 in an unbroken stand with Owen Morgan (51 not out).
Essex began needing six points to secure the solitary promotion place from Division Two, although a total of five points will be enough if Sussex falter in their ongoing match against Worcestershire.
Sussex ended day one at Hove on 50-4, having bowled out Worcestershire for 306.
Play at Chelmsford began 90 minutes late as heavy traffic on the nearby A12 left Glamorgan's players stranded at the ground without any kit and, with the visitors in dire trouble midway through the morning session, wrapping up the title appeared to be a formality for Essex.
But Carlson - who had scored only 11 runs in his previous four first-class innings with a highest score of 10 - was backed up well by his lower-order colleagues before bad light ended play with a total of 14 overs lost.
Essex included Varun Chopra and Adam Wheater in their line-up following the pair's recent moves from Warwickshire and Hampshire respectively.
