Man in court over Stonehaven pool 'sexual exposures'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 60-year-old man has appeared in court charged with exposing himself at an Aberdeenshire swimming pool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alexander Shepherd pled not guilty to two charges of sexual exposure to a young child at Stonehaven open air pool, under the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009.
Police Scotland earlier said incidents happened on Saturday 6 August, and on Wednesday this week.
Mr Shepherd's trial at Aberdeen Sheriff Court was set for November.
Meanwhile, a man has appeared in the same court charged with public indecency after an incident at Bon Accord Gardens in Aberdeen at about 17:45 on Wednesday.
David Adams, 51, denied the offence.
Police are still appealing for witnesses, and are particularly keen to trace two women who were with two children in the gardens near to Springbank Terrace who may be able to assist with enquiries.
