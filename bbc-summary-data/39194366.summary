[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who was jailed for causing a fatal motorway pile-up when she lost control while using her mobile phone has been struck off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christy George, 39, from Nottingham, was driving to a shift at a Coventry hospital when she hit a lorry on the M1 in November 2014.
One man died in the crash and a woman broke her neck in two places.
At a hearing, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) said George's conviction had impaired her fitness to practise.
George had been travelling at 70mph when she crashed into a lorry while trying to overtake it between junctions 21a and 22 in Leicestershire.
The lorry crossed the central reservation and hit six other cars on the opposite carriageway.
George denied causing death by dangerous driving and two other charges but was found guilty and jailed for five years.
She was also banned from driving for 10 years.
The NMC panel said it was particularly concerned she had attempted to delete her phone records in the immediate aftermath of the smash.
It also noted she had failed to learn her lesson from a previous crash in which she reversed into an eight-year-old boy while on her phone, for which she was also convicted of careless driving.
In a statement read at the hearing, George said she was "genuinely and sincerely sorry for all the pain I have caused".
"My reckless behaviour has caused all this and I know my apology will not make any difference to anyone now.
"I have stopped driving after the accident and I have no intention to take up driving ever again," she added.
The panel concluded George's convictions "make a striking off order the only sanction that would adequately reflect the gravity of these offences".
