Janet Commins: Man's trial for 1976 murder is postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a man charged with murdering a Flintshire schoolgirl 40 years ago has been postponed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Anthony Hough, 58, was due to go on trial this week at Mold Crown Court.
But there were delays at the start of the trial on Monday and the judge, Mr Justice Lewis, has agreed to fix a new date for 26 June.
Mr Hough, of Maes y Dre, Flint, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Janet Commins in January, 1976.
He also denies a charge of rape and a further sexual offence.
The body of Miss Commins, 15, was found under a hedge in a school playing field in Flint.
One of the reasons for the adjournment was the unavailability of prosecuting barrister Elwern Evans QC, who was said to have been in hospital overnight.
The judge was told that senior officers would speak to Miss Commins' mother to explain why the trial had to be adjourned.
