[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Cronin, 60, from Guilden Sutton, near Chester, died following a crash near Rossett flyover on the A483 Wrexham bypass last Thursday.
Polish national Damian Niepieklo, 22, has also been charged with failing to stop and failing to report an accident.
He was further remanded in custody until 26 June when the case will be heard at Mold Crown Court.
Mr Niepieklo spoke only to confirm his name and age, and to confirm he understood the charges.
There was no application for bail.
In a tribute on Friday, the family of Mr Cronin, a member of Chester Triathlon Club, described him as the "best possible dad, husband, brother and partner to have, willing to do anything for anyone".
