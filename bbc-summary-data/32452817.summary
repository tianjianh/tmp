Involved in politics since his teenage years, Mr Nolin, a lawyer by training, was appointed to the Senate in 1993 and became Speaker late last year.
Mr Nolin had spoken publicly about the rare form of cancer that he was diagnosed with five years ago, the CBC reports.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he was "deeply saddened" by the news.
Mr Nolin was remembered by the Canadian prime minister as an "affable and cultured man" who "never lost track of the higher interests of his fellow citizens".

Mr Nolin is survived by his wife, Camille, and three children, Mr Carignan's statement said.
