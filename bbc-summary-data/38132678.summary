Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale says his side's form should continue to improve as more of his established players return to fitness.

Centre-back Troy Brown made his first start in three months in the 0-0 draw with Luton, and Ryan Harley was on the bench for the first time this season.
City also expect to have Lee Holmes back for their next League Two game.
"We've got a chance to start putting a run of games together because we should have a full squad back," Tisdale said.
City were hit by a host of injuries at the start of the season and have yet to see summer signing Troy Archibald-Henville take the field.
Ryan Harley has not featured since September and Jordan Tillson and Tom McCready are also out.
Exeter have taken four points from their last two games to move out of the League Two relegation places - and went close to beating current leaders Carlisle before eventually going down 3-2 at Brunton Park earlier this month.
"Troy (Brown) has been out a long time, been training very hard, but he hasn't played a reserve game or even done much off the bench," the Exeter boss told BBC Radio Devon.
"He and Jordan Moore-Taylor looked like they were back to their partnership of old and they looked after the attack of Luton really well.
"It's great to have Ryan Harley back on the bench, so gradually we're getting backing to full fitness."
