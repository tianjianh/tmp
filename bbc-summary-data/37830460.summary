Wales came from behind to beat Italy 20-14 in a qualifier in Monza to secure their place in next year's tournament.
"The game in Wales is growing," the Salford Red Devils prop told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It's getting bigger and bigger with a lot more homegrown players coming through."
Kopczak continued: "Hopefully a lot more people will come and watch and see a lot of talent on show.
"We've got a lot of young, exciting prospects in the Super League now as well and it's great to see."
Wales qualified for the World Cup after finishing top of European qualifying group 1 having also beaten Serbia 50-0.
They will face Papua New Guinea and Ireland in Group C and will also be up against Fiji in an inter-group game.
"The group we're in is a very tough and physical group," Kopczak added.
"We know what we need to do and we've got the skills to match them."
