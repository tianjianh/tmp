Marley Watkins headed past Bradford goalkeeper Ben Williams after latching on to George Williams' perfect cross.
The midfielder also went close soon after but curled his shot wide after a mazy run, while Josh Morris fizzed his drive wide at the other end.
Bradford's best chance of the second half saw Jamie Proctor miss an open goal from distance.
Barnsley climb to 13th in the table and are two points behind 11th-placed Bradford, who are five points adrift of the play-offs.
