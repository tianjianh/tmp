During the trip, he went to his ancestral home in the small village of Moneygall, Co Offaly.
Mr O'Malley paid tribute to President Obama as a "spectacular leader and role model" whose "character is impeccable".
"The last sentence that President Obama said to me on Wednesday of this week when we were saying goodbye was 'please tell them (Ireland) I'm coming'.
Mr Obama will officially leave the White House when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated on 20 January.
