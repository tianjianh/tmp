[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Allan Stanley, 76, of Nefyn, was snorkelling around the island of Gozo when he was hit on 19 June.
His widow Diane told the inquest in Caernarfon it happened in seconds. She said: "There wasn't enough time for me to shout or do anything."
A conclusion of accidental death was recorded by coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones.
The inquest heard Mr Stanley was snorkelling in a bay when a rigid inflatable boat started up.
"A person snorkelling is very difficult to see," Mr Pritchard-Jones said.
"At best it's only part of the top of the head that can be seen.
"Whether the person operating the boat looked or made any efforts to see if anyone was in the water, I can't say."
Pathologist Dr Mark Lord told the inquest Mr Stanley suffered head injuries and his death was "likely to have been virtually instantaneous".
