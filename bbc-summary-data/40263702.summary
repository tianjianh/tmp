CalMac ferry breakdown disrupts Arran services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ferry services to Arran will be disrupted for at least another week because of a serious breakdown on one of the two ferries which cover the route.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Operator Caledonian MacBrayne said the MV Isle of Arran would be out of action for at least another seven days.
Problems with the vessel's engine mean that only about half of the scheduled services are running.
The breakdown also means that there are no sailings to Campbeltown.
Calmac said the 33-year-old ferry's engine had suffered significant damage and it was unlikely that she would be able to return to service until next Wednesday.
The vessel also suffered a serious breakdown last year but under went a refit over the winter months.
The MV Isle of Arran has been used to provide an enhanced service between Ardrossan and Brodick over the summer months in recent years.
It also covers a weekend route to Campbeltown which became permanent last year after a three-year experiment.
A new ferry, which is still being built and will be named the Glen Sannox, is to be introduced on the Arran route next year. It is not yet known if it will cover the Campbeltown service too.
The breakdown means only about half of the timetabled services between Ardrossan and Brodick are currently running.
Calmac said anyone who could not get their car onto their preferred sailing could still travel as a foot passenger with no advanced booking required.
The firm said some people who want to take their car to Arran may want to consider the three-hour road journey to Kintyre, then sailing from Claonaig to Lochranza.
Campbeltown can still be reached by plane or by bus.
