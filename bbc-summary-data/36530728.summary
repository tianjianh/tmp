Worcestershire's One-Day Cup group game against Leicestershire at New Road was abandoned without a ball bowled after heavy rain left the outfield saturated.

Umpires Nick Cook and Neil Bainton inspected the ground several times before finally calling the game off early in the afternoon at 14:15 BST.
Leicestershire, who have now lost two matches in a row to the weather, are still looking for their first win.
Worcestershire move up to second in the North Group after taking one point.
"It's desperately frustrating," Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes told BBC Hereford & Worcester. "At one stage, we thought we might some sort of game, maybe a 20-over match but that last huge downpour sadly put paid to that."
"We've had two wash-outs in a row," said Leicestershire's elite performance director Andrew McDonald: "It is one of those uncontrollable thing. We are playing an outdoor sport and when it rains, you can't play."
