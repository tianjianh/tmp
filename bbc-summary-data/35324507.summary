[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spanish forward Sola, 29, known as 'Kike', joins Boro for the rest of the season, having scored three goals for the Spanish La Liga side this season.
Boro also have ex-Murcia striker Kike, 28, and forwards Cristhian Stuani, Diego Fabbrini and David Nugent in their squad.
"He's bringing us something we don't have," Aitor Karanka told BBC Tees.
The Boro boss added: "He's another striker, he's a second striker or sometimes number 10. His skills are different and he can play English football because he is strong."
