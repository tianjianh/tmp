Wimbledon 2016: Andy Murray's reunion with Ivan Lendl 'key to his mental game'

Andy Murray's reunion with coach Ivan Lendl will help perfect the mental game required for another Wimbledon title challenge, says his mother Judy Murray.

Britain's world number two, 29, won Wimbledon, the US Open and Olympic gold with Lendl from 2012 to 2014.
"One of the big things Ivan helped Andy with when they worked together the last time was the ability to set his focus when he got distracted," said the former Great Britain Fed Cup captain.
"It's good to have him back."
She added: "When you get into the critical moments there are so many good players that you can't afford to have momentary lapses in concentration.

"As a player, Lendl was remembered for the poker face, the relentlessness, just that focus that he was on a mission and nothing would distract him. I think he helped Andy a lot with that the last time."
Meanwhile, John McEnroe believes Wimbledon, which begins on Monday, represents Murray's best chance of beating Novak Djokovic to a major title.
The Serb has already beaten Murray in the Australian and French Open finals this year, and has only lost two of their last 15 meetings.
"In ways he's getting closer. I think he's best suited on grass and just has the crowd more on his side here at Wimbledon," seven-time Grand Slam winner McEnroe said.
"So I think that's his best chance. Not that he can't beat Djokovic at the US Open, he beat him in Rome not long ago, but his record has recently not been good.
"Murray is a great player, there's no question about it. But at the moment there's no question that the level Novak is at is something that you rarely, if ever, see."
