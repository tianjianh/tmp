The 32-year-old, the number one ranked Test bowler, has been out of action with a groin strain since the first Test against India in early November.
But in Cape Town this week he was able to complete two bowling spells at match intensity in the nets, run sprints and do agility tests and fielding drills.
The first of the four-match Test series begins in Durban on 26 December.
Proteas team manager, Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: "Dale has put a lot of work into his training and rehab since his return from India so we are very happy to have him back from injury.
"He was put through a thorough fitness test on Thursday by physiotherapist, Shane Jabaar, he came through the tests without any discomfort and will be available for selection for the first Test match against England."
Steyn has taken 402 wickets in 81 Tests at an average of 22.56, including 46 in 11 matches against England.
South Africa remain at the top of the Test rankings despite a 3-0 defeat in India this month.
