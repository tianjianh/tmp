[SN]TITLE[SN]
Myanmar country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Myanmar, also known as Burma, was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The generals who ran the country suppressed almost all dissent - symbolised by the house arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi - and stood accused of gross human rights abuses, prompting international condemnation and sanctions.
A gradual liberalisation process has been under way since 2010. The country is expected to see a major shift after the government changed hands early in 2016.
The dominance of the largest ethnic group, the Burman or Bamar people, over the country's many minorities has been fuelling a series of long-running rebellions, although a gradual peace process yielded a draft ceasefire deal in 2015.
Population 48.7 million
Currency Kyat
Area 676,552 sq km (261,218 sq miles)
Major language Burmese, minority languages
Major religions Buddhism
Life expectancy 64 years (men), 68 years (women)
President: Htin Kyaw
Htin Kyaw was sworn in as president in March 2016, ushering in the first democratically elected government into office after decades of military rule.
Rightfully, the job belonged to Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been the face of the pro-democracy movement and who endured decades of house arrest and harassment by military rulers without ever giving up on her non-violent campaign to unseat them.
But Suu Kyi was barred by the constitution from becoming president, and she made it clear that whoever sits in that chair will be her proxy. She has said repeatedly she will run the government from behind the scenes.
Htin Kyaw will be remembered by history as the first civilian president for Myanmar and the head of its first government to be elected in free and fair polls.
The military retains considerable amount of power in the government and parliament.
Myanmar's media have seen a gradual easing of strict state controls imposed after the 1962 military coup.
Under reforms introduced since 2011 by a new government, Myanmar has unblocked international news websites, emigre news websites and YouTube. In 2012, it lifted pre-publication censorship for the press and allowed privately-owned daily newspapers to publish.
But the state still controls the main broadcasters and publications.
