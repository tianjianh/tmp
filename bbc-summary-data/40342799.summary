Daniel Garland denies £1m blackmail plot against G4S

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Durham man has denied a £1m blackmail plot against the security firm G4S.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Garland admitted making a hoax threat to the firm in January, claiming bombs were attached to G4S employees' cars and were ready to explode.
But the 19-year-old, of Durham Place, Chester-le-Street, pleaded not guilty to a linked £1m blackmail charge.
Garland was granted bail at Teesside Crown Court ahead of a trial which is due to take place in September.
