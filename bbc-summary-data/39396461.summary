Kyle Naughton is fit after sitting out two games with a hamstring problem, while all of Swansea's international players are available.
Middlesbrough are bolstered by the availability of defender Daniel Ayala following a hamstring problem.
George Friend and Calum Chambers are also close to returning after respective calf and foot injuries.
Alistair Mann: "After seemingly starting to pull clear of trouble, two successive defeats to sides in a similar plight have drawn Swansea back into the dogfight once again. They can ill afford a third.
"That said, the situation of their weekend visitors is even more desperate - a fourth defeat in a row might cause Middlesbrough to be cast adrift of the safety line.
"The last time Boro registered three points was before Christmas, when they recorded their biggest victory of the campaign, with the Swans their beleaguered opponents.
"As then, Swansea's Achilles heel remains their defensive frailties. Middlesbrough's has been in attack, and with both acutely aware of the damaging effect of a defeat it's all set to be a frantic tussle."

Swansea head coach Paul Clement on reports Gylfi Sigurdsson has said he wants to play for a 'big' club: "I've no problem with Gylfi saying that because what I see in him is a player very motivated to play well here and help us remain in this league.
"I've had no conversation with him about going elsewhere. Everything has been about training hard and doing his best for Swansea every day. I see it in the extra work he puts in and, that for me, is no coincidence why he is such a good player.
"But we shouldn't worry about this. Our focus now is on preparing for Middlesbrough and the next nine games."
Middlesbrough head coach Steve Agnew: "Paul Clement is a very, very good English coach and he'll have them well organised with creative players going forward.
"We haven't scored enough goals. We have to now think of way to create more chances. And converting those chances.
"Lots of ideas have gone into the players and I'm sure they'll respond."
Swansea will look at this as a game they need to win for several reasons, one of which is they will go eight points above Middlesbrough if they do.
