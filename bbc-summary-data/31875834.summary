The Chilean was asked about behaviour towards officials after criticism of Chelsea during Wednesday's Champions League match against PSG.
Pellegrini insisted he was "not talking about Chelsea" but said there are "different ways to win".
"You must analyse which is the correct way and which is not the correct way," he said.
"I'm talking about a lot of things that happens in different games with different teams that they always try to work and to press the referee.
"You will never see players from City surround the referee. Maybe you can discuss with the referee about a decision but just one moment in a game. That is not a way this team is prepared to win."
Manchester City play at Burnley on Saturday (17:30 GMT) with the chance to close the gap on Chelsea to two points before the Premier League leaders host Southampton on Sunday.
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has played down reports of a half-time argument between Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho during the 2-1 defeat by Liverpool last month.
The Chilean added that a "discussion" between the pair had not affected morale in the dressing room.
He said: "There is not any problem. There was a normal scene, nothing important. It is not important to talk about what happened 20 days ago.
"The squad is absolutely together."
City play the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at Barcelona next Wednesday, and trail 2-1 from the first game. Title rivals Chelsea were knocked out by Paris St-Germain this week.
Pellegrini said: "I don't know what impact it will have in the title race. Not only for Chelsea, for all the teams, it is very important to be involved in last stages of Champions League but when you, for different reasons, cannot continue it is important to see what happens to you in domestic games.
"Chelsea must focus their targets in the Premier League.
"We are trying to do what we did before the first leg against Barcelona. That game was Newcastle [who City beat 5-0] in that moment. We will try to do exactly the same. I hope we can do it."
The defender, 34, has signed a 12-month contract extension to stay at the Etihad Stadium until June 2016.
Pellegrini said: "I think that Martin is a very important player for our squad. He had a very good previous season and is doing well this campaign.
"For his experience, because he is an important leader, I think this it is very good news for him and the club, because he is happy here."
The Manchester City manager has been linked with a possible future move to Napoli.
Pellegrini added: "My future is very easy. I have a contract here until June 2016 and I will finish my contract here and if I can extend my contract, I will extend my contract.
"When I sign a contract, I always try to finish my contract in the amount of years I signed for at the beginning. If I am not happy, maybe you try to finish your contract earlier. Here I am very happy. I will continue without any problems until the end of my contract."
Former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has been showing an interest in City midfielder Yaya Toure and striker Stevan Jovetic.
Pellegrini said: "I don't know how he has so much information about the players. Jovetic, the same as me, has a contract here. We are not talking about what will happen next season with the players. We are just thinking about Burnley.
"There is so much news about Yaya from the beginning of the year. Maybe everyone would like to have Yaya in their squad, but he is a contract here, he is happy here, he will continue here."
