A three-year-old girl's anti-litter campaign has prompted a council to increase the number of bins on its streets.

Matilda Rusby's family posted pictures of the young eco-warrior picking up rubbish in their street to social media.
Councillor Karen Bolger described the photos as a "wake-up call", and spoke with North Tyneside Council.
She said the council had arranged for extra bins and signs as a result.
Frankie Rusby, Matilda's mother, said her daughter describes litter in their street, in North Shields, as "naughty" whenever she sees it.
"It's a stark reminder of how bad things are when it takes a three-year-old to tell adults that this is wrong," she said.
"When I saw her with gloves on picking up other people's litter and putting it into her black bag I just thought 'this isn't right, my daughter should be playing on this street, not cleaning it' and so it went from there."
Ms Bolger said Matilda had shown people the need to be "proactive and proud of our area".
"Since getting in contact with the Rusby family I have enlisted the help of North Tyneside Council," she said.
"They checked the street bins and confirmed regular bin collection, they stencilled "pick up after your dog" on the pavement and they checked and confirmed road sweeping schedules."
She said she would be working with the family to encourage further clean-up efforts.
