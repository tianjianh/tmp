The Dutchman, 18, successfully passed 49 other cars on his way to 12th place in the Formula 1 drivers' championship, with 49 points.
Toro Rosso driver Verstappen won praise in his first season for his judgement on track and his maturity off it.
The average number of overtakes per driver during 2015 was 26.8, according to F1 tyre supplier Pirelli.
Verstappen's team-mate, Carlos Sainz, achieved the second-highest number of overtakes with 45.
Despite the rookie pair's daring during the 19 races in 2015, there was a 10% drop in overtakes compared to 2014 - down from 639 to 509 in total.
In 2011 - the year Pirelli returned to the sport and the DRS overtaking aid was introduced - the number of on-track moves tripled compared to the previous year, but since then the total has fallen steadily.
BBC F1 analyst Eddie Jordan compared Verstappen to two of the sport's greatest drivers, Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher.
And 5 live commentator Allan McNish said of a move Verstappen pulled at a particularly difficult corner during the Belgian Grand Prix: "That is the first time I have ever seen someone go around the outside of someone at Blanchimont in my life."
Verstappen will again partner Spaniard Sainz for the 2016 F1 season, but has attracted attention from the bigger teams, including Ferrari.
