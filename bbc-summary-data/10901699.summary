Army bomb experts examined a suspicious van in Campion Court but nothing was found.
The alert began after police received reports that a number of masked men were seen in the area at 0020 BST on Saturday.
Police also received an unconfirmed report that shots had been fired.
SDLP Foyle MLA Pat Ramsey said residents were highly distressed at having to leave their homes.
"These dissidents need to catch themselves on," he said.
"Twelve families in Campion Court have had to go through a terrible ordeal having been forced to evacuate their homes because of a suspicious vehicle.
"On Tuesday businesses on the Strand Road were blown to bits and peoples' lives put under threat by these terrorists.
"All those responsible are doing is bringing misery, harm and distress to innocent people in this city who simply want to live in peace."
He said it is only a matter of time before one of these devices goes off prematurely and kills someone.
Police want anyone with information to contact them on 0845 6008000.
