Cat gets stuck in car engine after Evesham vet trip

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cat ended up stuck in the engine compartment of a car when it escaped its owners after a trip to the vet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The family were leaving De Montfort Veterinary Hospital in Evesham when the mog decided to flee, Hereford and Worcester fire service said.
Crews had to dismantle part of a Vauxhall Vectra in the Merstow Green car park to free the cat, called Mousey, at about 10:30 BST.
Watch commander Russell Broadbent said the cat was unharmed.
"He had been for some injections and I think he managed to get out of the basket on the way to the car," he said.
"He went under one car and got into the engine.
"I think he was just a little bit agitated."
