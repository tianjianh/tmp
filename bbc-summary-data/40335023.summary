[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford student banned over Ku Klux Klan costume

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Oxford University college has taken action against a student who wore a Ku Klux Klan hood to a party.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dean of Christ Church said the student has been banned from future events and must apologise in writing.
The event was held in December 2016 and the college emailed students about the incident on Wednesday, which it called "deeply regrettable".
Speaking to the Cherwell university newspaper the student said the costume was intended as satire.
Junior censor at the college, Brian Young, said in an email to students that "an offensive item of clothing was worn at a college bop".
He added: "We wish to affirm in the strongest possible terms that Christ Church is firmly committed to equality, diversity, and respect, and we absolutely will not accept any breaches of such toleration.
"Anyone who causes offence by disregarding these commitments is subject to strict college discipline."
The student, who has not been named, told the Cherwell he wore a sign reading "Middle America" and a pillowcase that resembled a Ku Klux Klan hood because the party's theme was 2016.
He said "I did not intend to offend anyone and removed the costume within two minutes of arriving after realising the inappropriateness of it."
Dean of Christ Church, the Very Rev Prof Martyn Percy, said the student's behaviour was "completely unacceptable".
