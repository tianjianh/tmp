The Showtime network revealed the news at a Television Critics Association meeting in California, where the actor made a cameo appearance.
"I think you need a damn good cup of coffee," he said, referring to one of Cooper's original catchphrases.
"I'm very excited to return to the strange and wonderful world of Twin Peaks," MacLachlan said.
He added: "May the forest be with you."
Twin Peaks creator David Lynch later announced the news on Twitter with the hashtag #damnfinecoffee.
The third series will be broadcast on Showtime in the US in 2016.
It will come 25 years after the first two series, which were aired in 1990 and 1991. A prequel film, Fire Walk With Me, was released in 1992.
The unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in a US town after the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer.
The show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.
The actor went on to forge a successful TV career after Twin Peaks, with credits including Agents of Shield, The Good Wife, Portlandia, Desperate Housewives and Sex and the City.
