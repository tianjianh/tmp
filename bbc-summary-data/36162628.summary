Iorfa, who has played 44 games this season, has been linked to several southern-based Premier League clubs.
But Jackett remains unconcerned until interest in the highly-rated 20-year-old becomes somewhat more concrete.
"There's been enough speculation but we've had no bids or inquiries from clubs, which is good," he told BBC WM.
"That's not to say that we won't. We can only react when that happens. As a general principle, we want to work hard to keep our best players, if that is possible.
"We have one or two promising players here, which is a plus for us. But we would prefer to keep our best players and build around them."
Iorfa, a pacy, overlapping full-back who can also play in the middle, is a Wolves academy graduate and is now considered to be the club's most marketable asset.
Since making his professional debut on loan at Shrewsbury Town in March 2014, he has gone on to make a total of 73 career appearances to date.
Jackett admitted that any plans he might have to strengthen his first team squad are affected by the up-for-sale club's continued failure to find new owners.
"We do need to change things and the recruitment team here will have a good idea of exactly which players we need and which are available. But it's an ongoing situation with the club up for sale," he added.
"It doesn't appear that there is a takeover imminent, but it does affect the plans for the summer, there's no doubt about it.
"To really have enough to make a difference in this league you have to have deep pockets and then spend the money wisely."
Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett was talking to BBC WM's Rob Gurney.
