He died on Friday morning. His family paid tribute to his "legacy of love and laughter".

Rev Skellern, who was born in Bury, Greater Manchester, and trained at the Guildhall School of Music, began recording in the 1970s and released 14 albums.
He also wrote the lyrics to One More Kiss, Dear for the 1982 film Blade Runner.
He hosted the BBC Two chat show Private Lives and in recent years, turned his attention to choral music, often appearing on Songs of Praise.
In October the Bishop of Truro, the Right Reverend Tim Thornton, ordained him at St Wyllows church in Lanteglos-by-Fowey, Cornwall.
In a statement, his family said: "Peter's creativity in art, comedy and music stand as his legacy to love and laughter.
"The love he brought to us will continue to be shared with everyone through his music. We will miss him with all our hearts."
Bishop Thornton said he would be praying for Mr Skellern and his family.
"It really is very, very sad," he said. "Although we knew Peter was ill, the news that he had died came as a shock.
"I can only reflect on what a privilege it was to have known Peter, and to have ordained him."
