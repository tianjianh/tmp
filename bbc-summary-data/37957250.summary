[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland manager Gordon Strachan says he needs time to reflect on the World Cup qualifying defeat by England and refused to be drawn on his own future.

Headed goals from Daniel Sturridge, Adam Lallana and Gary Cahill sealed a 3-0 win for England at Wembley, leaving the visitors fifth in Group F.
"I've got to go away and have a wee look at it now and we have a debrief," said Strachan.
"It's hard to take in anything, it's not the time to think about it."
The 59-year-old added: "If you think I'm thinking about myself, then you don't know me. If you think I'm worried about myself, you're completely wrong."
Strachan added that he was "proud" of his side's effort and emphasised that he felt the outcome was "cruel" on his players given the level of their performance.
While he accepted there is a gap in quality between Scotland and England, he maintained - as he has done throughout a faltering campaign - that the players have been wholly committed to him and his tactics.
"I feel really proud about the way they played, they had no fear to their game," Strachan said. "At the same time I feel really hurt they had to go through that last 15 minutes having put so much in and believed in what we were trying to do.
"I came here with a team that got beaten 3-0, 3-1 and barely had a shot on goal, and it was nothing like that [tonight]. That was a braver, a more organised performance, so their families watching them and supporters can be proud of what they did.
"I don't think I can ask any more from what's in their locker. You just need a break every now and then or a wee bit of magic. I feel really down for the lads, but proud of what they tried to do."
Scotland missed two chances to level at 1-0 down and although England eventually ran out comfortable winners, to lose by three goals was harsh on the visitors.
"We're supporters, we watch from the sides and to put that much work in, to stick to a game plan, be brave and try to meet them up the pitch and we give up one chance on target and they score from it," added the Scotland boss.
"Half-time, you could see in their eyes they still believe that by sticking to what we're trying to do we can get there, and we go out in second half and have two chances, don't capitalise, then they get their second shot on target. After that it's going to be a long night. We stuck at it and when it gets to 3-0, it's over. You can forget the last 15 minutes."
Strachan made eight changes to the side that lost 3-0 in Slovakia last month. Leigh Griffiths started up front, while Ikechi Anya, Christophe Berra and Lee Wallace were drafted into defence.
The manager praised their efforts, but bemoaned the lack of reward for that industry.
"A lot of them have got to be pleased with themselves. Lee Wallace was phenomenal for somebody who's been out of the team for a couple of years. He never said a thing, just got on with it, came in and was brilliant," Strachan said.
"There are points where top teams seem to punish us. I've got to say, I don't know if we can work any harder than we do, in terms of playing and training and doing the coaching.
"Stewart Regan said he couldn't believe it was 3-0 to Slovakia and 3-0 to England. We might not be the best in the world, but you get the best out of them. I'm thinking only about them at this moment in time."
