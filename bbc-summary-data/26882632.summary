[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of a Glasgow drugs gang has been jailed for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Donnelly, 58, pleaded guilty at the High Court in Glasgow to a charge of directing serious organised crime.
The court heard he was the fixer in a £210,000 consignment of heroin and was later caught handing over £23,000 of drug money in a Glasgow street.
Donnelly was jailed at the same court in 1996 for heroin dealing. He was caught again in 2006 and jailed for 10 years for his role in a cocaine gang.
Sentencing Donnelly, judge Lord Boyd told him: "The trafficking of drugs is a vile and evil trade and is one that you have followed for many years."
The court head how Donnelly returned to crime in September 2011 shortly after being freed from prison.
Prosecutor Stephen McCloy told how Donnelly "directed" another individual in the purchase and supply of heroin.
Officers later arrested this other man in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, and discovered £210,000 of heroin in a car boot.
In December 2011, Donnelly was then spotted handing over a package to a woman in Balornock area of Glasgow.
The package was also later seized by police and found to be £22,970 in bank-notes linked to criminal activity.
Donnelly was eventually detained - but made no comment to officers.
Lord Boyd also made Donnelly the subject of a strict 10-year financial reporting order. This consists of various measures including Donnelly declaring any purchase over £500.
Following sentence, procurator fiscal Lindsey Miller said: "Donnelly was a significant figure in an organised crime group involved in the distribution of heroin in the west of Scotland.
"On his release from a lengthy sentence Donnelly immediately returned to directing the sale of Class A drugs."
