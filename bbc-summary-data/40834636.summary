[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnsley 1-2 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich Town made it two wins out of two at the start of the new Championship campaign as they came from behind to beat Barnsley at Oakwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Bradshaw headed the Tykes in front, but a series of fine saves by Bartosz Bialkowski denied them a second.
Ipswich sent on David McGoldrick and Martyn Waghorn after the interval and it proved an inspired move.
McGoldrick volleyed Town level and recent signing Waghorn fired a shot in off the post from Joe Garner's pass.
Barnsley, who had not won any of their nine previous league fixtures against Ipswich, went into the game without full-back Andy Yiadom, who has been linked with a move to Huddersfield.
Their 4-5-1 formation gave them the upper hand in the first half as George Moncur and Bradshaw both tested Bialkowski before the latter netted from Ryan Hedges' overhead kick.
Moncur also had an effort cleared off the line by Garner as Ipswich failed to muster a single shot on target in the opening 45 minutes, but the introduction of McGoldrick and Waghorn boosted their potency as Barnsley lost their attacking verve.
Adam Jackson was just wide for the home side with an acrobatic effort shortly after McGoldrick levelled from Jonas Knudsen's cross, before Waghorn drove home his first for the club as Ipswich achieved back-to-back wins in their first two games for the first time since George Burley was manager in 2002-03.
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom:
"To lose a game when they only had two shots on target is deflating, but the performance was there and there were lots of good things.
"We should have been out of sight at half-time. Mick McCarthy made changes at half-time and brought on a lot of experience.
"We played well and lost, so we will have to play well on Tuesday night [at home to Nottingham Forest] and ensure that we win."
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy:
"When a manager makes two substitutions and they go on and win the game for you it's great. But they have to take the credit.
"They haven't gone and just shown their displeasure at not playing. They've gone on and won the game for us, which is brilliant.
"They had the better of the first half but the changes we made at half-time made the difference."
