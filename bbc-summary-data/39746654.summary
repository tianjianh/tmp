Charlotte Cwajna and her son Harrison, from Fleet in Hampshire, were sightseeing in Florida, when the aircraft lost power at 600ft (180m).
Ms Cwajna said: "There was a clunk and we dropped in the sky."
She said the pilot, who was also uninjured, was "dripping with sweat and visibly shaken" after landing.
"He saw a bit of grass in between two highways and brought it down within 30 seconds," Ms Cwajna said.
The flight above Orlando on 20 April was a treat for Harrison on the final day of a family holiday.
Harrison said: "I knew something was wrong. Lights started to flash. The helicopter was slowly going down. It was scary."
Ms Cwajna said they were in a "state of elation" after getting out of the helicopter and inspecting the damage.
Air Florida Helicopters Charters said the pilot's "professional skills and fact action" had saved those on board.
An investigation is under way into the cause of the emergency.
