Last season's Pro12 decider was held in the same venue, which has a 51,700 capacity, with Welsh side Scarlets defeating Munster.
The league has been expanded to include South African sides Southern Kings and Cheetahs.
Cardiff's Principality Stadium was also considered before Dublin was selected to host the match on 26 May.
BBC Sport understands the Principality Stadium pitch will have been taken up before the final, in preparation for hosting music events in the summer.
"Stadium availability always comes into focus as well and once we factored in event clashes in other countries then Dublin became the front-runner for 2018," said Pro 14 chief executive Martin Anayi.
"Aviva Stadium is a world-class arena and that is one of the top-ranking criteria when it comes to deciding upon the venue for our showpiece game.
"Dublin is a fantastic venue for rugby supporters who are used to coming here in the Six Nations."
The league starts on the weekend of 1-2 September, with champions Scarlets taking on Southern Kings in Wales.
