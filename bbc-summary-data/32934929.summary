[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver allegedly told to transport up to £180,000 worth of cocaine was so inept he forgot where he was supposed to be going, a court has been told.

Hugh Brady travelled around Bangor, County Down, for at least 90 minutes before giving up and heading back towards Belfast, the court heard.
Police said they seized 3kg of drugs after stopping the 49-year-old's car on the Sydenham bypass on Wednesday night.
Mr Brady, of Molyneaux Street in Belfast, was granted bail.
He is charged with possessing cocaine with intent to supply.
Opposing bail, a detective said the accused could face further demands from the criminal gang whose cocaine has been lost.
"During interview he alleged that he had been approached by persons who, in his words, 'you can't say no to', and was asked to deliver a package to another location," the detective said.
The court was told Mr Brady failed to find his intended address and called at a garage to ask for directions.
Police said he also purchased a mobile phone in a Tesco store, but did not have enough money to buy credit for it.
A defence solicitor said the accused was at the "very bottom" of any operation to move the drugs.
"He has been told where to bring it, and he forgot the exact location - that shows how nervous he was," the lawyer said.
The judge was told Mr Brady had given up and was driving back to Belfast when he was arrested.
"That shows how inept he was, how far down the tree he is that he can't carry out this simple task," his lawyer added.
"He apologised repeatedly throughout (interview) and said 'I should never have done it'.
"But once in the car he found himself with the drugs, he panicked and that's the reason why he couldn't find the address."
When the detective was asked if police believed he was an ordinary citizen rather than part of a drugs gang, he said that only someone in a trusted position would be given such a consignment.
Granting bail, the judge ordered Mr Brady and his wife to lodge the £3,000 cash surety, said to represent their life savings.
He is due back in court on 26 June.
