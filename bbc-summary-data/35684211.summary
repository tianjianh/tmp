The Shanghai Composite shed 2.7% to 2,687.9 points, dashing hopes that Friday's brief recovery could be sustained.
The index was down as much as 4.4% in the morning, hitting a 15-month low.
The losses came despite the G20 meeting in Shanghai over the weekend pledging to work towards boosting growth both in China and globally.
The yuan edged lower against the dollar as the central bank set a softer midpoint of 6.5452 per dollar - the lowest in almost one month.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng also lost ground, but fared better than the mainland, closing down 1.3% at 19,111.9 points.
Japanese shares also failed to extend their gains from last Friday, trading flat as the government released mixed economic data.
The latest figures showed industrial output rose by 3.7% in January, the first increase in three months.

The Nikkei 225 index closed 1% lower at 16,026.7 points.
Gaming giant Nintendo's shares finished the day 0.5% down after dropping sharply by 5% at one point in early trade.

In Sydney, the ASX 200 closed flat at 4,880.9 points.
The lacklustre performance comes ahead of Australia's fourth-quarter economic growth data released on Wednesday.
In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index also finished the day flat at 1,916.6 points.
