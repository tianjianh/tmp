In the footage, an officer tells Bijan Ebrahimi he is a "pain in the ass" and she does not want to talk to him.
Mr Ebrahimi, 44, was killed in a vigilante attack in 2013 after he was falsely accused of being a paedophile.
PCs Kevin Duffy, 52, Leanne Winter, 38, Helen Harris, 40, and PCSO Andrew Passmore 55, deny a charge of misconduct in public office.
The trial at Bristol Crown Court has heard that they saw Mr Ebrahimi as "a nuisance".
The jury has heard that Mr Ebrahimi called the police on 11 July 2013 to report he had been attacked by his neighbour Lee James, 26, who suspected him of being a paedophile.
But it was Mr Ebrahimi who was arrested and James' threats were overlooked, the court heard.
CCTV footage released on Thursday, which has been shown to the jury, includes PC Harris at Broadbury Road Police Station telling Mr Ebrahimi: "Don't talk to me" and "I'm not talking. I can't even be bothered to waste my energy on you."
She added: "You're not my friend - I'm a police officer and you're a pain in the ass. Don't speak to me."
Mr Ebrahimi was released by police the following day, 12 July. Two days later James attacked Mr Ebrahimi outside his flat then set fire to his body.
He pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence. Accomplice Steven Morley was sentenced to four years in prison for assisting an offender.
The trial of the police officers and PCSO continues.
