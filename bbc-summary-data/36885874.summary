New Celtic signing Kolo Toure is looking forward to "something really special" after reuniting with manager Brendan Rodgers.

The 35-year-old defender worked with Rodgers at Liverpool.
"He is a top manager," enthused the Ivory Coast international. "For me, he is one of the best.
"He did a great job at Swansea then he came to Liverpool, did a great job again, and I am sure he will do a great job here."
Having signed a one-year deal on Sunday, Toure, who has also played for Arsenal and Manchester City, is not in Celtic's travelling party for the Champions League trip to Kazakhstan ahead of the first leg of a third-round qualifier against Astana.
"I'm fit," he said. "But of course I have just joined the team and I need time to be ready.
"I can't tell you when but I am ready right now in my mind and I will give everything I have got every day to be able to help my team-mates.
"I just joined the club and there are players who have been working really hard for two months. The manager is the best guy to make the decision. For me, I stick to anything the manager says because every decision he makes is for the good of the team.
"I will be with them in my heart, I will pray for them as well. Definitely we'll do it."
Toure played in the 2006 Champions League final with Arsenal and assistant manager Chris Davies believes the arrival of such an "inspirational" player will be a valuable asset on and off the field.
"He's a top defender with real authority and experience," said Davies.
"We are not only getting a really good player but someone who can inspire players around them to help the team.
"He has been working with a personal trainer so it is an important week physically for him and we will see how it goes."
Rodgers' right-hand man would not be drawn on attempts to sign Scott Sinclair from Aston Villa.
The clubs have been in negotiations about the winger's transfer but no agreement has been reached on a fee.
"It would obviously be disrespectful for us talk about a player who belongs to another club," Davies said.
"The club are working behind the scenes to bring players in who will make a difference. It has got to be the right deal and right players. We are focusing on the players who are playing."
Toure and Sinclair were team-mates at Manchester City and the new arrival talked highly of the transfer target.
"I haven't spoken to him but he is a really good player - a top professional," said Toure of the 27-year-old.
"I think he is going to be a good player for the club, because attitude-wise he is very good as well."
