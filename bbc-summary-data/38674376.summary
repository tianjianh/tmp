The defending champions and second seeds lost 6-3 7-6 (7-5) in one hour and 12 minutes on Thursday.
American pair Querrey and Young will face Russians Karen Khachanov and Andrey Kuznetsov in the second round.
Querrey also plays world number one Andy Murray in the men's singles third round on Friday.
Britain's Dan Evans was due to play in the doubles alongside Nick Kyrgios against Dusan Lajovic and Viktor Troicki on Thursday, but the Australian has withdrawn because of injury concerns.
Kyrgios said he sustained a knee injury playing basketball several weeks ago.
The 21-year-old lost to Andreas Seppi in the men' singles on Wednesday, while Evans progressed to the third round after beating world number seven Marin Cilic.
They have been replaced in the draw by Argentines Renzo Olivo and Guido Pella.
