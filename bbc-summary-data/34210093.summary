Ed Jackson scored the game's only try, which Jason Tovey converted having earlier scored two penalties.
Neither side scored in a lacklustre second half, with Dragons securing their first win after a narrow defeat away to Connacht.
Zebre remain winless, losing a second successive game in Wales following a heavy loss at Cardiff Blues.

Dragons had been forced into a late change with Wales centre Tyler Morgan replaced by Ross Wardle because of illness.
Tovey's two early penalties put the home side in control before Zebre were reduced to 14 men when captain George Biagi was yellow carded.
Dragons took full advantage of Biagi's absence as former Wasps back-rower Jackson crossed for the opening try on his home debut with Tovey converting.
Ulrich Beyers failed with two penalty attempts for the visitors and Dragons went in at half-time leading 13-0.
Lyn Jones's side had the majority of the possession and territorial advantage but found Zebre hard to break down after the interval.
Number eight Dries van Schalkwyk became the second Zebre player to be yellow carded but Dragons failed to capitalise as they laboured to their first win.

Dragons assistant coach Shaun Connor: "We knew there was going to be a reaction from last week against the Blues and they came to try and slow the game down and play at their pace and it worked for them in the end.
"I thought we started pretty well. We felt if we were accurate in the first half hour we could have scored a few tries and then the game would have opened up for us in the second half.
"But because we weren't accurate it was a bit of a dog-fight in the end but it's a win for us. There's lots to work on but we'll take four points."
