Saracens' Vunipola, 24, was injured in the 37-21 win over South Africa and will not train for the next two days.
Second row Dave Attwood, 29, who replaced Vunipola on Saturday, will go back to club Bath after having an injection on a knee injury.
"We've got a few bumps and bruises from Saturday," said England forwards coach Steve Borthwick.
"We'd like all our players fit, but, whenever there's an injury, it creates an opportunity and some players are grabbing those opportunities with both hands.
"In the build up to last Saturday's game, the players who weren't in the matchday squad put pressure on those first-choice players to help the preparation.
"To have the guys pushing themselves like that is really important."
