[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aldershot Town 2-0 Sutton United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aldershot overcame Sutton to stay in the National League play-off hunt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kieron Cadogan and Adam Coombes both threatened as Sutton made a decent start, but their hard work was undone in cruel fashion just before the break.
Shamir Fenelon and the in-demand Idris Kanu created havoc with a searing counter-attack for the Shots, before Nicky Bailey's attempted clearance went in for an own goal off goalkeeper Will Puddy after 42 minutes.
Bernard Mensah made sure of the win in stoppage time, lashing home after good work from Anthony Straker, ensuring Aldershot remain seventh and within reach of the play-off places.
