Australia were 'overly sensitive' to cancel their tour of Bangladesh

Australia were "overly sensitive" to postpone their tour of Bangladesh over security concerns, says Pakistan Cricket Board president Shahryar Khan.

Bangladesh police are investigating the murder of an Italian aid worker who was shot on Monday, with the Islamic State group saying it is responsible.
The two-Test series was due to begin in Chittagong on Friday, 9 October.
"One man gets killed, an Italian, and the tour is off. We've had 50,000 people killed in Pakistan," Khan said.
Khan was referring to figures estimating the number of "fatalities in terrorist violence" in Pakistan since 2003.
In May, Pakistan hosted their first home full international fixture since gunmen attacked a bus carrying the Sri Lanka team on its way to play in Lahore in 2009.
"A certain amount of tension is likely through terrorism, but they have to trust the Bangladeshis, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and Pakistanis. We give them 100% protection," Khan added.
"Some of the countries, like Australia and New Zealand, are perhaps oversensitive."
Cricket Australia had initially delayed the team's scheduled departure on 28 September while it worked on a "revised security plan".
But it now says that official advice means it had "no alternative but to postpone the tour".
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it was "disappointed" by the decision but is "committed to rescheduling the series at a later date".
On Wednesday, the BCB had promised "VVIP" treatment for the Australian team, saying they would be given the same level of security afforded to visiting heads of state.
England are due to tour Bangladesh to play two Tests and three one-day internationals in October and November 2016.
