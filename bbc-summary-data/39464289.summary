Queens' Lyndon Dykes was ruled offside when netting after 10 minutes.
But fellow striker Dobbie made the visitors' dominance count by netting in the 71st and 76th minutes.
The former Swansea striker volleyed home from the edge of the box and then waltzed though the defence to score his second shortly afterwards.
Queens have four games remaining this season and are six points behind fourth-placed Dundee United, who have a game in hand.
