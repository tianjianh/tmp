[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
LA Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena believes Ashley Cole is worth a gamble after signing the former Chelsea and England left-back.

Cole, 35, will link up with former international team-mate Steven Gerrard after the defender's contract with Roma was terminated by mutual consent.
Cole joined the Italian Serie A side in July 2014 and made 16 appearances.
"Whether you think it's a risk or a gamble, these are the risks and gambles that you take," said Arena.
Capped 107 times, Cole has won three Premier Leagues, seven FA Cups, one Champions League and one Europa League.
Roma sacked manager Rudi Garcia, 51, on 13 January after a period in which he won just one match since the beginning of November.
"Ashley Cole has a great history," added Arena.
"We know that doesn't necessarily translate on the field when you come to Major League Soccer, but my interactions over the last couple of months show me he's a player that has a strong desire to play here in Los Angeles.
"He's very fit and has a burning desire to get back on the field and prove to people he can still play.
"I have a hard time believing he won't be one of the better left-backs in our league."
