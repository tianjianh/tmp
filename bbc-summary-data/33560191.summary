[SN]TITLE[SN]
Warrant issued for Kidderminster 'revenge porn' defendant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the first people due to appear in court under new "revenge porn" laws has had a warrant issued for his arrest after failing to turn up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alex Till was due at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court, having already had a previous hearing adjourned after complaining of feeling unwell.
Mr Till, 25, of Manor Close, Kidderminster, is accused of putting a private sexual photograph on Facebook with intent to cause distress.
The offence can lead to a jail term.
Prosecutor Owen Beale told magistrates Mr Till had been due to attend along with a sick note explaining his initial absence from court on 9 July.
He said: "Whether he's ill or not, unfortunately one would have expected him to contact court if there was a good reason.
"In absence of that reason, I ask for a warrant without bail."
The warrant means Mr Till can now be arrested by police and brought to court at a later date.
The specific offence of revenge porn, which includes the sharing of material both on and offline, became illegal after the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill received royal assent earlier this year.
Offenders face up to two years in jail if convicted.
