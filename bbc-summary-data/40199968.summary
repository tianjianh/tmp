[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Julie Walker, 37, and Lucas, six, died despite the efforts of members of the public and emergency services to save them.
Lucas' 13-year-old brother, Samuel, was among those who joined the rescue effort.
The Crown Office said the procurator fiscal had concluded that no further investigation was required.
It was a busy Saturday afternoon at Aberdeen beach last August when Ms Walker and Lucas drowned.
Ms Walker had gone into the sea to try to save her son.
A Crown Office spokesman said:  "The procurator fiscal received a report in connection with the death of a 37-year-old woman and a six-year-old boy in Aberdeen on 20 August 2016.
"After careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case, the procurator fiscal concluded that no further investigation is required.
"The family have been informed of this decision."
A review was ordered following the tragedy, leading to the setting up of the Aberdeen Water Safety Group.
It involves eight different agencies, including the RNLI, Aberdeen City Council, UK Coastguard and Police Scotland.
Classmates of Lucas at Bramble Brae School were joined by his relatives when they paid tribute to him by releasing balloons.
