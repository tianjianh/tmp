[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pineridge Park Homes unauthorised caravan site 'must close'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An unauthorised caravan site near Wokingham must close, a High Court judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22 caravans at Pineridge Park Homes, Nine Mile Ride, are home to more than 20 children and their families.
Residents have resisted the borough council's attempts to move remove them from the site since 2009.
A judge has now rejected claims that the human rights of the children had not been taken into account.
Wokingham Borough Council has twice issued enforcement action, calling on those living at the 0.67-hectare (1.65-acre) site to leave.
The latest deadline passed on 12 June, and residents could now face court action if they fail to act.
