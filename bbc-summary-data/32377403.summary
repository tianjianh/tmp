Culture Secretary Sajid Javid, joining the election campaign in Wales, said it can bring people together and celebrate "our unity through diversity".
The Games, which were held in Cardiff in 1958, could also give an economic boost to Wales, the Tories have said.
Cardiff council and the Welsh government have been exploring a possible bid for 2026.
Speaking ahead of his visit to Wales on Monday, Mr Javid said: "Wales has always played an important role in the Commonwealth and having hosted the games over 60 years ago - I think it's time it came back and I'm glad to see the Welsh Conservatives will be working to make this happen.
"The Commonwealth Games is about bringing people together and celebrating our unity through diversity and sport is one of the very best ways to do that."
He added: "I really hope that Wales is successful in its bid. I know well how passionate the Welsh people are about sport and I know they will want to see this bid made a reality."
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Welsh Labour will bid for the support of older voters, saying it will keep free bus passes and TV licences.
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood welcomed support from SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon for parity of powers and funding for Wales with Scotland.
"Just as the SNP is doing for Scotland, Plaid Cymru is fighting for the best deal possible for Wales in this election," she said.
The Lib Dems are expected to restate their opposition to regional pay in the public sector.
Meanwhile Monday marks the deadline for registering to vote in the election on May 7.
