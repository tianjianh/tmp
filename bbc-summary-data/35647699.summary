[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United remain in the Premier League relegation zone after Swiss midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri's late strike lifted Stoke City up to seventh.

Stoke dominated most of the game, but neither side failed to create clear chances in a low-key first half.
Newcastle improved after the break but went behind when Shaqiri's 20-yard strike flew in past Rob Elliot.
Jack Butland superbly saved substitute Seydou Doumbia's injury-time header as Stoke clinched a third straight win.
And, seconds after Doumbia almost levelled, the Potters hit the crossbar through Marko Arnautovic's stinging shot.

How tough is a cold night at Stoke?
Newcastle, who had not played since the 5-1 hammering at Chelsea 18 days ago, knew that a point would move them out of the bottom three at the expense of Sunderland and Norwich.
But the Magpies arrived at a cold, wet and windswept Britannia Stadium having scored just seven away goals this season - the lowest total in the entire English league.
That miserable statistic did not look like improving, with the visitors - despite a resolute defensive display - barely stretching Potters keeper Butland throughout.
However, the England keeper - who denied Newcastle victory in October's reverse fixture - remained alert to come to Stoke's rescue in the dying moments.
"I'm glad we don't have to play against Jack Butland every week," said McClaren, whose side suffered a 15th league defeat of the season.
"He denied us victory at St James' Park and tonight he denied us a point I think we deserved. It's cruel that we lost."
Stoke dominated possession and territory throughout, but were unable to break down a compact Newcastle side who defended deep in a bid to stifle their hosts.
The Potters' supporters were becoming increasingly frustrated until Shaqiri scored with his side's first shot on target of the second half.
The former Bayern Munich and Inter Milan winger ran onto Mame Biram Diouf's lay-off to blast an unstoppable past an off-guard Elliot.
"It was a great goal to win the game," said Potters manager Mark Hughes afterwards. "It had great power, was a great strike and the keeper didn't see it."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes:
"They were difficult conditions today. The first half went against us, but I thought we were excellent in getting hold of the ball and probing crosses. The negative was not getting on the end of them.
"Second half, with the wind, we thought it would be an advantage but it didn't turn out that way.
"We kept going and Newcastle didn't have too many opportunities."
Newcastle manager Steve McClaren:
"I couldn't fault the players. We were organised, hard to beat, compact and we frustrated Stoke. They had one shot in the second half and scored.
"If we continue that hard work then we'll get what we deserve.
"It's difficult to stomach but you have to. Saturday at home against Bournemouth is a big game - we've got 11 games left and need a certain amount of victories. With the talent we've got, we're confident we can do it."
Newcastle face another important game in their battle against relegation, hosting 15th-placed Bournemouth at St James' Park on Saturday (15:00 GMT).
Meanwhile, Stoke go to 10th-placed Chelsea, who are three points behind the Potters, at the same time.
