[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Around 15,000 people took part in the Velothon Wales race through Cardiff, Newport, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly, prompting road closures.
Tacks were thrown on the road forcing some to carry their bikes for a time, with reports that one person was hurt.
Organisers said the area was cleared quickly.
