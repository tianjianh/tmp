In 2014, the Foxes held an open top bus parade to celebrate promotion to the top flight after a 10-year absence.
Thousands of people lined the route from High Street, past the Clock Tower before about 6,000 fans greeted the buses in Town Hall Square.
City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby has previously told the Leicester Mercury that too many people would want to celebrate to be able to hold anything in Town Hall Square again.
Leicester City will lift the Premier League trophy on Saturday at their last home match against Everton.
The parade is expected on 16 May, the day after Leicester's final game of the season at last season's champions Chelsea.
