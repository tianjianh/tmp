[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 2-0 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth's poor start to the League Two season continued with a 2-0 defeat at Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A first Football League goal for Ryan Edwards and a stunner from Tom Barkhuizen earned the points but the Shrimps had to thank goalkeeper Barry Roche, who kept his side ahead with a string of superb second-half saves to see pre-season favourites Pompey without a win in three league games.
Morecambe started brightly and took the lead on 11 minutes with a rare goal for defender Edwards. His first effort was blocked by a Pompey defender but the ball came back perfectly to him and he lashed a shot from 12 yards past David Forde.
Portsmouth hit back with Carl Baker going close before the home side added a second with a brilliant long-range goal from Barkhuizen.
The striker ran through the middle of the Pompey midfield and let fly with a 25-yarder that flew past Forde and ended up in the top right-hand corner of the net.
Portsmouth began to dominate possession but were restricted to long range efforts with Kyle Bennett twice firing over before Morecambe wasted a glorious chance of a third.
Barkhuizen was again the tormentor as he sped past Enda Stevens but shot into the side netting when he should have done better.
Portsmouth started the second half dominantly with Baker forcing a fine save from Roche with a shot from the edge of the area.
The saves continued with the best being a point blank block to deny Curtis Main, who looked sure to score from six yards.
Gary Roberts and Baker were both denied twice by the Irishman and the Shrimps could have added a third in injury time when Paul Mullin was through on goal only to be denied by Forde.
