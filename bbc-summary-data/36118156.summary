Kodjia met Joe Bryan's flicked pass to run into the box and open the scoring before the break, beating Terriers goalkeeper Jed Steer with a low finish.
Bryan then made it 2-0 and Kodjia reached 20 goals for the season with an effort from 25 yards.
Lee Tomlin then showed great control to lift the ball over a defender on the edge of the box before adding a fourth.
City went close to making it an even bigger win as Bobby Reid and Tomlin both saw efforts hit the woodwork either side of the break.
The Robins' first win in four games lifts them above Huddersfield to 18th in the Championship.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson: "The goal [Tomlin's] had a touch of genius about it.
"We see Lee do that sort of thing in training, but it is another thing to do it in a game.
"It was the perfect final home game for us. Some of our football and the goals we scored would have delighted any coach.
"These are exciting times here and today was a great advert for our club, with the supporters and the players showing all that is best about it."
Huddersfield boss David Wagner: "It was the worst performance of the season. We were weak defensively and did not have the right balance.
"The first 25 minutes was okay, but after that it was not a good day. Every player should have his own motivation and I don't think that was the problem.
"We have shown in the past that the squad has a good fighting attitude, but it wasn't evident today.
"The players have put themselves under pressure for the last game of the season because we need a reaction to what happened today.
"They played more like individuals and not as a team."
