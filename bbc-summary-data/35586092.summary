Investigation of mental health deaths in Norfolk and Suffolk to report in May

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust caring for mentally ill people in Norfolk and Suffolk is to carry out an independent review of unexplained deaths.

Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT) has appointed Verita to examine how the deaths are dealt with.
The trust had 129 such deaths in 2014-15 - up from 61 in 2012-13.
Campaigners have welcomed the step and the first phase report is expected by the end of May.
The numbers of unexpected deaths will be compared with national rates to establish their significance.
"Any urgent concerns or emerging issues would of course, be immediately fed back to the board and actions put in place immediately," Michael Scott, chief executive of NSFT, said.
A second phase report should be ready in the summer.
"Our trust is a high reporter of unexpected deaths and serious incidents, but we are also a trust which demonstrates low levels of harm to our patients," Mr Scott said.
Verita, who were involved in the Jimmy Savile NHS abuse inquiry, will be supported by independent reviewer Colin Vose, who has worked on suicide investigation for a variety of organisations.
The figures about deaths last year were released earlier this week in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Liberal Democrats.
The trust was placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission in 2015 when it was described as "not a safe... service".
Anne Humphrys, from the Campaign to Save Mental Health Services in Norfolk & Suffolk, said the review was "fantastic news".
"We've been calling for this investigation for more than two years when we became concerned about the rise in unexpected deaths," she said.
