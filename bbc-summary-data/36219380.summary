Ms Davidson, who had previously been elected to Holyrood through the list, beat SNP candidate Alison Dickie by 610 votes.
She received 10,399 votes, an increase of 15% from 2011 when the Conservatives came fourth.
Speaking after her victory, Ms Davidson said: "I promise I will serve to the very best of my ability."
She told BBC Scotland that all the indications were that the Tories had "edged ahead" of Labour in the battle to become Scotland's main opposition.
"This is indicative of how voters can change and make a considered choice," she said of her victory in the Edinburgh Central seat.
"I am under no illusion that everybody who voted for me in that seat is a true-blue, dyed-in-the wool Tory, and neither are they in places up and down Scotland.
"They are people who want us to do a very specific job, and that it is to hold the SNP to account."
The Tories have also gained Aberdeenshire West from the SNP and Eastwood and Dumfriesshire from Labour.
Oliver Mundell, the son of Scottish Secretary David Mundell, won the Dumfriesshire seat, with 13,536 votes.
Labour's Elaine Murray, who had previously held the seat, dropped to third place behind the SNP candidate Joan McAlpine, who came second with 12,306 votes.
Twenty-six-year-old Mr Mundell has spoken of helping to deliver leaflets for his father at the age of just eight.
He joined the Scottish Conservatives in 2012 after being inspired by the leadership of Ruth Davidson.
