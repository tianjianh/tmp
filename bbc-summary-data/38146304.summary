The pair were both substituted during the interval of Pompey's 2-1 defeat by Stevenage at Fratton Park.
Both players have agreed to make donations to the club's academy and community scheme by way of an apology.
In a statement, Portsmouth said they now consider the matter closed following an internal investigation.
"At half-time on Saturday, Michael and I engaged in a heated discussion that unfortunately escalated to an unacceptable point that we both regret," centre-back Burgess said.
"Our desire to win clearly crossed a line and our differences were quickly resolved, even before the end of the game."
Midfielder Doyle, who is also the club's captain, admitted he could not "undo what has been done".
He said: "I can assure everyone that this incident will only serve to strengthen my and the team's resolve to deliver on the pitch.
"I am, and will continue to be, totally committed to this football club."
