The 23-year-old from County Wicklow ended his two rounds on nine under par.
Dunne held a share of the lead after 54 holes of last year's Open at St Andrews while still an amateur but slumped to 30th after carding a final round of 78.
Since turning professional, Dunne has established himself on the European Tour with five top-20 finishes.
The Irishman was the first amateur since 1927 to lead the Open after 54 holes in his second appearance at the championship.
Dunne became a professional after sinking the decisive putt as Great Britain and Ireland regained the Walker Cup at Royal Lytham and St Annes in September.
He clinched his 2016 European Tour card by tying for 13th at the the Final Qualifier in Girona.
Dunne joins fellow Irish players Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell, Shane Lowry, Darren Clarke and Padraig Harrington in the field for Troon.
Earlier this week, McDowell was confirmed as one of 11 players who had secured their places in the Open through being the highest-ranked non-exempt players in the world rankings.
