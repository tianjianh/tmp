Chris Froome missed out on a fourth Criterium du Dauphine title as Jakob Fuglsang took victory with an attack to the summit of Sunday's final stage.

Three-time Tour de France winner Froome began one minute three seconds behind leader Richie Porte, a gap he failed to bridge on the Plateau de Solaison.
Instead it was Denmark's Fuglsang who distanced Porte, his overall win aided by a time bonus for winning the stage.
Ireland's Dan Martin was second, enough to leapfrog Froome into third overall.
Astana rider Fuglsang finished the 115km ride from Albertville one minute and 15 seconds quicker than BMC's Porte of Australia - the exact time difference between the two after Saturday's stage seven.
But with the stage win Fuglsang also picked up a 10-second time bonus, meaning Porte, a former team-mate of Froome at Team Sky, just missed out on his first Dauphine title.
Froome, 32, won each of his three Tour titles after his three previous Dauphine successes, with the race typically a good test of form going into cycling's most prestigious stage event, which begins on 1 July.
The Briton finished fourth overall, one minute and 33 seconds behind Fuglsang, and one second behind Quick-Step rider Martin.
Team Sky sporting director Nicolas Portal said Froome would have more to offer at the Tour de France.
"We came here to try to win, and we saw Richie was super strong, and now we can see Fuglsang was clearly very strong too," he said.
"Froomey is on the way up, step by step to the Tour. For sure he's going to progress. He finished the race really well here, making some hard attacks and some long pulls.
"Obviously it didn't work out with the victory, but we've done a really  good job here. We're all looking forward to the Tour and there's more to come."
