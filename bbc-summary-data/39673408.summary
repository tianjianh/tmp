The Dragons explained in a statement that Jackson suffered a 'non-rugby related injury on 8 April.'
"He has undergone a neck operation, which was a success, and the surgeons are satisfied with the results. Ed is making significant progress and is currently recovering," Dragons said.
Jackson, 28, signed a contract extension with the region in December.
However, he suffered a shoulder injury in February that required surgery.
Jackson has made 36 appearances for the Dragons since joining from Wasps in 2015.
