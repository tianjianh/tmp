Cows 'feasting on rubbish' after Hungerford Common rule change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cows have been grazing on household rubbish since a refuse collection rule change saw bins gathered together to provide a bovine morning feast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The cows have been seen "running around with black bags hanging out of their mouth", according to a pub landlord in Hungerford Common, Berkshire.
Resident Alison Judge said the cows appear "for a Thursday morning feast".
Hungerford Town and Manor said having a central collection point for bins would help reduce damage made by lorries.
It said it had introduced a communal collection point in the Down View area so the bin lorries no longer had to "back up beside homes".
But the landlord of nearby pub, The Downgate, has expressed concerns over the collection area being set up close to his property.
David Yates said: "The problem is, you don't want customers sat outside on the tables and looking at litter all the time.
"Not only that, I'm a little concerned for the cows, which I did tell the Town and Manor about, because unfortunately you've got cows running around with black bags hanging out of their mouths."
Robert James, commons secretary for Hungerford Town and Manor, said a solution to the problem was being investigated.
