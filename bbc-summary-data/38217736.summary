[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 1-0 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nelson Oliveira scored for the third successive match as Norwich beat Aston Villa to earn just their second victory in their last eight Championship games.

City took control after the interval and Oliveira placed a 25-yard shot into the corner following a purposeful run.
A drab first half saw only two shots on target - both by the hosts.
But the Canaries then upped the tempo and Robbie Brady went close, before Oliveria struck to ensure a second defeat in three matches for Villa.
A goalmouth scramble almost saw Villa snatch an equaliser in injury time, but that was just about the only noteworthy chance they created in a lacklustre display.
The visitors, who had only lost once in nine under Steve Bruce, rarely threatened and it was Norwich who had the best chances both before and after Oliveira's superb strike.
The Portuguese striker almost scored in the first half but his follow-up effort was kept out by Italian keeper Pierluigi Gollini, who had failed to hold on to Martin Olsson's initial shot.
Brady should have scored after a fine team move only to shoot wide but, after Oliveira's effort, Norwich held on to move up to eighth in the table - one point off the play-off positions.
Norwich City boss Alex Neil:
"We started brightly, were in control for most of the first half and were totally dominant in the second and fully deserved to take the three points.
"It was a night when we stood up to the challenge like men and everyone did their jobs well.
"We have been on a poor run and I know the results have been unacceptable. But we played really well against Brentford, were good in the second half at Barnsley and have played well again this evening. I certainly think we are moving in the right direction and now we need to push on.
"Nelson showed his quality again tonight. He has been excellent in the last three games and has got the goals he deserved. I knew what I was getting when I bought him and now he has settled in you are seeing what he is capable of."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:
"I can accept getting beat, what I can't accept is players not putting their boots on, not turning up.
"We did not do enough with the ball or without it and we got exactly what we deserved from the game - nothing. I can't remember a chance, I can't remember a cross going into their box, and the number of times we gave the ball away was totally unacceptable.
"Everything was set up for us after our late winner against Wigan at the weekend and I thought we would go into the game bouncing, but it never happened.
"Norwich were on the back of a tough run but we didn't put them under any pressure at all. You have got to play at a certain level if you want to play for Aston Villa and they didn't come anywhere near to reaching that.
"Having seen that I can see why the club decided to make a change and bring me in."
