Aaron Lennon is still missing but Muhamed Besic is nearing a first-team return following nine months out with a serious knee injury.
Burnley midfielder Steven Defour is fit, having played only twice in 10 weeks because of various injuries.
Johann Berg Gudmundsson has stepped up his recovery from knee ligament damage but might not be risked.
Guy Mowbray: "Everton are hunting a new club record for successive Premier League home wins, against a Burnley side still seeking ANY away win.
"The Clarets have three chances left, with the last (and furthest!) trip to Bournemouth probably their best bet - assuming both are safe from relegation by the season's penultimate weekend.
"With one win in nine since January, it's testament to how well Burnley did earlier in the season that they'll surely be okay by then.
"The FA Cup semi-finals line-up should mean that Everton are sitting pretty for a Europa League place, and whilst a strong finish won't get them in the top four it might prove key to keeping Romelu Lukaku."

Everton manager Ronald Koeman on his players' ambitions: "If you ask the players one by one, everyone will mention they like to play Champions League: for every manager, for every player and also the fans.
"Our next step is to play in Europe. It will be difficult but if we finish fifth or sixth it would be perfect as you don't play any qualification games for the Europa League."
Burnley manager Sean Dyche on Michael Keane's PFA Young Player of the Year nomination: "It's a great sign for him and he deserves to be in that company.
"We're not shining lights of the Premier League or a superpower, so for other players to see that and say 'hang on a minute, he's been terrific in a smaller side at a smaller club' is good, it's good of his peers to recognise that.
"He's in some very good company, some players who are having absolutely fine seasons, and he's having a very strong season too."
Since suffering their only home league defeat of the season, against Liverpool in December, the Toffees have won seven league games in a row at Goodison Park.
I think Everton's excellent run will continue - and maybe Ross Barkley will deliver the knock-out blow.
Prediction: 2-0
