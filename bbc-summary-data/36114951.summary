Green Party campaign spiked after voting slip error

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Green Party in Wales has been forced to abandon its "Vote Green on Grey" assembly campaign after an error meant postal slips will not be grey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Postal slips in Ceredigion, Preseli Pembrokeshire and Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire have been re-printed on tan-coloured paper to correct an error in the instructions.
Voters must discard the grey slips.
A Green Party source said its "Vote Green on Grey this May" leaflets and video were now useless as a result.
The party had printed leaflets and created a video for social media.
The source said: "As you can imagine, we've been really shocked by this muck up. You've seen the film we've made, fortunately we haven't begun sharing it yet. It's now useless.
"We've also had a new batch of Green on Grey leaflets printed. At least we can use them in other parts of the region."
Tom Marshall, the party's campaign manager for Mid and West Wales said: "We are extremely disappointed to hear of the error with the ballot papers.  'Vote Green on Tan' just doesn't have the same ring about it."
Regional returning officer Mark James said: "It appears that a computer error by printers who prepare papers for Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire led to an unfortunate misprint."
