A stretch of road in North Yorkshire, shut due to a risk of a landslip, is to reopen after work was carried out to make it safe.

The A59 at Kex Gill, between Harrogate and Skipton, closed on 5 January after cracks were found on the hillside.
A survey showed part of the slope had moved 80cm (31in) following heavy rain at Christmas.
There were concerns over water that had become trapped in the slope.
North Yorkshire County Council has installed additional drainage channels and placed large rocks to strengthen a supporting wall.
The council said it had installed monitoring equipment in the slope.
Conservative county councillor Don Mackenzie said he was aware that the closure of the road had caused disruption.
"Stabilising these steep slopes above the A59 has been a difficult and complex operation and we have been working seven days a week to try to complete the work in as short a time as we are able safely to do so," he said.
"The slopes are steep and this high ground is subject to harsh weather conditions, but we have been able to push on with the work more recently."
