The company also said revenue rose to $8.42bn, a 17% increase from the same period last year.
Fox was helped by the success of the films X-Men: Days of Future Past, Rio 2, and The Fault in Our Stars.
Shares in the company rose 2% in after-hours trading.
"As we close the fiscal year, I continue to have confidence in our ability to execute our growth plan and drive value for our shareholders," said Mr Murdoch in a statement accompanying earnings.
