[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Norwich City stunned Sunderland at the Stadium of Light to earn a deserved first win of the season.

Russell Martin opened the scoring fortuitously, inadvertently turning the ball home after Costel Pantilimon parried a Robbie Brady shot.
Steven Whittaker slammed home a second after a one-two with Wes Hoolahan, who also assisted in the Canaries' third from Nathan Redmond after the break.
Duncan Watmore then scored a late consolation on his Sunderland debut.
The 21-year-old struck with the Black Cats' second shot on target in the 88th minute, by which time many home fans had already left the ground.
The result leaves Dick Advocaat's side, who were beaten 4-2 at Leicester on the opening day, bottom of the Premier League table after two games.

It was difficult to tell because of Norwich's urgency, fluidity and snappiness in attack.
The away side's opening goal might have had a heavy hint of fortune - goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon was particularly unlucky to concede seconds after brilliantly turning the ball behind for a corner - but it was certainly well deserved.
Manager Alex Neil is now unbeaten in 13 away games since taking over in January and his team were well on top throughout. Hoolahan was composed and inventive and Redmond a constant menace with his pace.
Goalkeeper John Ruddy, relatively untroubled behind a solid Norwich defence throughout, pounded the ground in frustration after seeing Watmore's slightly miscued volley bounce in late on.
It would be interesting to hear the Sunderland manager's thoughts on the work that is still required to transform his side.
There was less of the defensive calamity that marked their opening-day defeat, but instead the Black Cats looked toothless in attack.
Jermain Defoe and Steven Fletcher threatened sporadically but were isolated for long periods with seemingly little connection to midfield, where new signing Yann M'Vila made his debut.
The 25-year-old was outdone by youngster Watmore, whose every enthusiastic contribution was cheered by the home fans.
In truth, though, none of the four attackers on show - including substitute Danny Graham - looked likely to provide the presence Sunderland will need this season.

Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat: "Two games two defeats, we did not expect. We have to discuss with the players how we go on.
"It was the same in pre-season and you hoped it would change but it is not changing. Myself as well, I am responsible for that, no doubt.
"They can talk and I can talk. Together we have to find out if we can find the solution, otherwise we have no chance."
Norwich City manager Alex Neil: "I thought it was very good, similar to last week in that we dominated the game.
"We had the cutting edge this time though. The first goal is crucial - we didn't look back. I have a great group, they work hard and work as a team."
BBC football analyst Garth Crooks on Final Score: "From what I've seen both last week and this week, I don't think Sunderland are going to stay in the Premier League. Whoever does Match of the Day tonight is going to have a field day."
