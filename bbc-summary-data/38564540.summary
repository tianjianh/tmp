Moore made 19 appearances for the Super League club after initially joining on loan from Castleford in 2015.
"Both myself and Scott agreed a fresh start would be best for all concerned and I wish Scott good luck in the future," chairman Michael Carter said.
In October, Moore, 28, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer and theft in Leigh, Greater Manchester, and bailed until 10 March.
