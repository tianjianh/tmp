Wayne Rooney's 100th cap: Mascot to England captain

England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday is likely to see Wayne Rooney marking his 100th cap.

The 29-year-old made his England debut aged 17 in 2003, and he's the country's fourth top goal scorer with 43 strikes.
Ahead of the match former England captain Alan Shearer said: "He's one of the few top players I think we [England] have."
But there are some things you might not know about the Manchester United striker and his career landmark.
Wayne will join recent international retirees Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole in the 100 club.
Billy Wright, who played between 1946 and 1959, and Bobby Charlton are also among those to reach the milestone.
The three most capped England players of all time are Bobby Moore (108), David Beckham (115) and Peter Shilton (125).
Wayne Rooney is just seven goals away from overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton's all-time England record of 49.
And the former Everton striker is confident he will surpass the record of the 1966 World Cup winner.
He said: "The record has stood for so many years, there have been plenty of players who haven't been able to break it. I'm still relatively young and believe I can do it."
Rooney became the second winner of the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year award back in 2002.
Aged 17, he was chosen ahead of shooter Charlotte Kerwood and gymnast Becky Owen.
Last month, Wayne set a new milestone by becoming the first Premier League player to reach 10 million Twitter followers.
It also made him the most popular British athlete on the social media service.
No, his eldest son Kai, five, hasn't been snapped up just yet, but his younger brother John is playing for Conference side Chester.
The 23-year-old has also had spells at New York Red Bulls and Barnsley.
The better known Rooney was making appearances in the Premier League years before cementing his professional arrival with his memorable strike for Everton against Arsenal in October 2002.
At the age of 10, he was a match-day mascot for Everton against Liverpool.
You may have noticed this already, but Wayne has a bit of a temper sometimes on the pitch.
He's in the top 10 most booked players in Premier League history and still has a few seasons left to climb this less than desirable list.
It's compiled by the premierleague.com and Opta.
It's not just in the Premier League that he has fallen foul of officials.
He got sent off in England's Euro 2012 qualifier for kicking out an opponent and famously his temper got the better of him six years earlier when he stamped on Portugal's Ricardo Carvalho.
You may remember that was followed by the wink from his Manchester United team-mate of the time Cristiano Ronaldo.
His relationship with the England fans has not always been great.
He didn't endear himself to some who'd travelled all the way to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup.
He reacted angrily to the team being booed after a poor 0-0 draw against Algeria.
He may have a temper and some say he could have achieved more as a player, but in years to come many of you will remember Wayne for his goals.
He has scored 43 times for his country, including this one against Denmark.
Some people will always mock and criticise Wayne.
Earlier in his career he became known for enjoying his time away from the pitch and was pictured polishing off a few drinks in a swimming pool.
He's also been photographed puffing on a cigarette or two.
