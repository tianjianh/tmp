The 21-year-old, who is a product of Saints' academy, has made 25 appearances since making his first-team debut in December 2013, including four this season.
"This is the right place for me, you see it time after time that young players get opportunities," said Reed.
Midfielder Jake Hesketh, 20, has also signed a new deal through to 2021.
Hesketh, who made his Saints debut in December 2014, is working his back from an injury suffered in October.
