Scottish Borders Council (SBC) and Historic Environment Scotland (HES) have teamed up to turn out the lighting in Jedburgh, Kelso and Melrose.
The switch-off will take place on 25 March from 20:30 to 21:30.
Earth Hour is an hour every year where people are encouraged to turn off their lights in order to raise awareness of environmental issues.
Louise Cox, SBC's environmental strategic co-ordinator, said: "We are proud to support WWF's Earth Hour once again and to this year work alongside HES to switch off the lights at three of the Border abbeys.
"We are excited to be involved with such an inspiring, symbolic event, which reminds everyone that they can make a difference to help protect our planet, and would encourage people in the Borders to take part."
Dr Mairi Davies, climate change manager at HES, said the initiative was about collective effort and people "coming together to raise awareness of climate change".
"I'd therefore like to thank all at SBC for supporting this year's light switch off at three Borders abbeys - Melrose, Jedburgh and Kelso."
SBC is responsible for the lights at each of the abbeys, while HES maintains the three buildings.
