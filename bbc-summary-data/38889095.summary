The hosts took the lead through John Swift's first-half strike, but Jota levelled for the Bees from close range.
Lasse Vibe's strike then put Brentford ahead, before Danny Williams turned in Garath McCleary's cross for the Royals.
And Yann Kermorgant picked out Beerens to slot into an empty net after a poor clearance from goalkeeper Dan Bentley.
The result extends Reading's unbeaten run to six games, with Jaap Stam's side reducing the gap to second-placed Brighton to five points.
They are also nine points clear of Norwich in seventh, following the Canaries' 2-2 draw with leaders Newcastle.
Brentford, meanwhile, slide to 15th in the table, just eight points above the relegation zone.
The Bees have conceded 10 goals in their past three games in all competitions, taking just one point over that period.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"There is a lot of belief in the players in what they can do and what they can achieve.
"We always talk about keeping on going, even when you're losing. You never give up. That's what the players are doing.
"You need to have a good mentality in the team and in the squad. In this league, it's very difficult to have an easy game.
"We're very willing to work hard to get results and that's what we've done tonight."
Brentford head coach Dean Smith:
"We created a number of chances that we probably should have taken and, to be honest, we could have been out of sight.
"I was disappointed to go in behind at half time. At times, our attacking intent was good.
"We all know what happens when goalkeepers make mistakes. Dan will be a bit gutted, but he won't be the only one because we have had chances that we haven't taken and where we could have put the game to bed.
"When we matched Reading's energy and got higher up the pitch, I thought there was only going to be one winner tonight. At times, we were excellent."
