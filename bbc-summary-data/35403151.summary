The 31-year-old made 62 appearances in two years for the Premiership side between 2007 and 2009.
"Once we knew Lewis was available, we've worked very hard to get him back here to the club," head coach Rob Baxter told the Chiefs website.
"We're very aware of the qualities he can bring to the squad and what kind of character he is."
The signing of Stevenson follows long-term injuries to Damian Welch and Mitch Lees.
"Once Mitch got injured we had to re-assess things, not just in terms of getting people to play, but also to ensure we had enough bodies for training," Baxter added.
"Over the last few weeks we've really cranked up the training we're doing and for us to keep progressing, I want us to have real quality in our sessions."
Stevenson was released from his contract with Ulster by mutual agreement.
"I appreciate how Ulster has handled this," he said. "I am extremely proud to have played a part in this Ulster team over the last five seasons. Every time I pulled on the shirt it meant something to me."
