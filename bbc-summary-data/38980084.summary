Kaden Reddick, from Reading, suffered serious head injuries in an accident involving a display barrier on Monday at the Oracle Centre branch.
The BBC has visited a number of stores and found no sign of the units, previously found at the tills.
Topshop said it removed the units with immediate effect for safety reasons.
"We are thoroughly investigating all the events surrounding this extremely sad situation," a spokesman said.
"Further to the recent incident in Reading, as a safety precaution we have decided to remove all the till barrier units in question from our stores across the country with immediate effect."
Ian Reddick, understood to be Kaden's father from East Kilbride in Scotland, paid tribute to his son on Facebook.
He wrote: "Love you my little man, it's hurting so much."
The Reading store has remained closed for the third day following Kaden's death.
Reading Borough Council, which is the enforcing authority for health and safety in the area, said investigations into the incident would "take time".
