[SN]TITLE[SN]
Appeal court jails Kelly Richards for sex with schoolboy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother spared prison for having sex with a schoolboy has been given a two-and-a-half year jail term after judges overruled her original punishment.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In March, Kelly Jane Richards, from Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff, admitted engaging in sexual activity with a child.
She received a two-year suspended sentence at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court.
But, on Friday, Richards was given a jail term by judges sitting at London's Court of Appeal.
They said the initial sentence was unduly lenient.
Richards, a mother-of-two whose husband has stood by her, was ordered to hand herself in at Merthyr Tydfil police station by 16:30 BST on Friday.
