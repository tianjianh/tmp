Brian Reader, 76, was jailed over the £26m Brinks Mat armed robbery in 1983.

Reader and Perkins have already admitted conspiracy to burgle the Hatton Garden safe deposit.
Reader, of Dartford Road, Dartford, was jailed for eight years for conspiracy to handle stolen goods after the gold bullion robbery in Hounslow, west London, in 1983.
Jurors at Woolwich Crown Court were told he was also sentenced to a further year in prison for dishonestly handling £66,000 in cash.
Perkins, of Heene Road, was part of a gang which broke into the Security Express depot in Shoreditch, east London, and escaped with £6m on Easter Monday, 1983.
The jury also heard details of the previous convictions of the other men who have already admitted their role in the Hatton Garden raid.
John "Kenny" Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, has convictions for offences including breaking in, theft and handling stolen goods.
Daniel Jones, 60, of Park Avenue, Enfield, has been sentenced for offences of robbery, burglary and handling stolen goods.
