However, BBC Sport Wales understands the FA and the Football Association of Wales are in dialogue over the issue.
The incident occurred when Scott Parker was replaced by Phil Jagielka.
Millennium Stadium officials also confirmed no official complaint had been received.
However, England boss Fabio Capello says the authorities should act.
He said: "It was a silly thing. When we changed Scott Parker I saw it but not before.
"It is not good. You need to find these people who are coming to the game with a laser. It is not sporting."
