England's target of winning the 2022 World Cup in Qatar has been softened by new Football Association chairman Greg Clarke.

BBC Sport understands the FA wants the country to be "ready" to win the competition, rather than it being an expectation.
The goal was set by predecessor Greg Dyke in 2013.
"I'm not going to put pressure on and say we are going to win this tournament or that tournament," said Clarke.
The ex-Football League chairman Clarke, who took up the FA role in August, has also criticised the use of a clock at St George's Park to count down to the 2022 final, calling it "daft".
England were knocked out of this summer's European Championship at the last-16 stage by minnows Iceland.
Roy Hodgson resigned as manager immediately after the shock defeat in July and has been replaced by Sam Allardyce, who oversaw a 1-0 win in the opening World Cup 2018 qualifier in Slovakia on Sunday.
