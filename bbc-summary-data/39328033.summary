The event is expected to raise around Â£1m for charity in its 34th year.
In the men's race, Olympic athlete Andy Vernon crossed the line in a time of 63 minutes, while Charlotte Purdue won the women's race in 72 minutes.
The runners were waved off by former Olympic sprinter Iwan Thomas MBE, Sir John Madejski and Reading's Mayor Mohammed Ayub.
Thousands flocked to the streets of the Berkshire town to cheer on the athletes and at the finish line at the Madejski Stadium, the home of Reading FC.
