Former Latics and Scotland defender Caldwell was appointed boss in April 2015 and led them to the League One title last season.
But they are 23rd in the table after 14 matches this term and have failed to win in their past four games.
"I feel that we need to act now in the best long-term interests of the club," chairman David Sharpe said.
"It's undoubtedly the toughest decision I've had to make since becoming chairman."
Caldwell, whose side had won only two of their 14 league games since being promoted, is the sixth Championship manager to leave their job this season.
The 34-year-old, who made 111 appearances for Wigan as a player, was in his first managerial role, having replaced Malky Mackay with the team eight points adrift of safety in the Championship with five games to play of the 2014-15 season.
He was unable to save the Latics from relegation, but led them on a 20-match unbeaten run in his first full season in charge to help them back into the second tier at the first attempt.
