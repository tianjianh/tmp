[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-3 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Ince scored twice as Derby County held on to win despite a spirited comeback by managerless Wolves.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ince pounced for Derby's opening goal from close range before Darren Bent doubled the visitors' lead with a stunning right-foot volley.
Wolves rallied after a dismal first half when Helder Costa pulled a goal back on the hour but Ince restored Derby's two-goal lead with a penalty.
Dave Edwards headed in Wolves' second but they were unable to force a draw.
Victory at Molineux enabled Derby to climb into the top half of the Championship table.
Wolves, who look set to appoint former Norwich, Aston Villa and Blackburn manager Paul Lambert as successor to Walter Zenga, slip to 19th - three points clear of trouble.
Caretaker boss Rob Edwards witnessed a poor first half from the hosts, who were indebted to goalkeeper Andy Lonergan keeping Derby's lead to just two goals at the break.
A much better second-half display saw an Ivan Cavaleiro shot cleared off the line by Richard Keogh before Costa's goal.
But a debateable penalty was awarded to Derby when Cavaleiro was adjudged to have fouled Ince and the forward added his second goal of the game from the spot.
Wolves had a strong penalty shout of their own turned down moments later when Ince appeared to trip Cavaleiro in the opposite box and Edwards' near-post header was not enough to rescue the game.
Wolves caretaker boss Rob Edwards:  "There is a lot of quality here and it is about finding some consistency now.
"We all need to stick together and I am sure that when the new manager comes in and has a couple of weeks to work with the players, we can get a positive result.
"The second half was a real positive for us.  That is how I love my team to perform, with that commitment and spirit and quality. At times it was all there.
"It was shame that we didn't put that into the first half and being a couple of goals behind is a mountain to climb."
Derby manager Steve McClaren:  "It was a fantastic first half. We earned the right to play and played great football. That is the kind of football that we want to see.
"We should have scored more than two in the first half but it was good to see he progress that we have made in three weeks that they can play at that level.
"It is hard to maintain for 95 minutes and we knew that we needed a third goal but when it came we shot ourselves in the foot again.
"In the end it was frustrating, but you can't fault the attitude and commitment. You have to build confidence and then belief comes."
