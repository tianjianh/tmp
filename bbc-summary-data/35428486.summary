The 24-year-old Scot will now play Belgian Joachim Gerard, who beat second seed Stephane Houdet 3-6 6-1 6-3.
The British number one said he was delighted to get past Fernandez in "one of the toughest matches of my life".
It is the first time Reid, from Alexandria, has made the final of a Grand Slam singles event.
Reid had reached the last four with a shock win over top seed and eight-time champion Shingo Kunieda from Japan.
