Fellaini swung an elbow at Huth after the German pulled his hair during Sunday's 1-1 draw at Old Trafford.
The incident was not seen by match officials but caught on video.
Both players, who could be banned for three matches, have until 18:00 BST on Wednesday, 4 May to respond.
The charges were brought after a panel of three former elite referees watched the video evidence and decided the players' actions warranted punishment.
Should Fellaini be found guilty and suspended, he would still be available for the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace because United have three league games left.
Defending the Belgium international, United manager Louis van Gaal said: "It's not in the books that someone has to grab by the hair and then pull it behind - only in sex masochism."
The Dutchman felt his side should have been given a penalty for the incident.
He added: "When I grab you by the hair, what are you doing? Shall I do it? It's also a penalty. When I grab your hair, you react also. I know for sure."
United are fifth in the Premier League but still have trips to Norwich and West Ham before hosting Bournemouth on the last day of the season.
Newly crowned Premier League champions Leicester have two games remaining.
In August 2015, Morecambe duo Kevin Ellison and Ryan Edwards were given three-match bans for violent conduct after they were found guilty of pulling the hair of Wycombe's Marcus Bean.
