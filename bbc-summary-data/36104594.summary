The master of a fishing boat where a crewman was lost overboard off the north Wales coast has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Robertson, 25, of Dalbeattie, Dumfries and Galloway, was lost at night after the St Amant left Holyhead, Anglesey, for west Wales in January 2012.
Alexander Baird, 55, from Kirkcudbright, had admitted a series of safety breaches on board.
He was jailed for nine months at Mold Crown Court on Thursday.
Baird had admitted a charge of  failing to discharge a duty to ensure the fishing boat, a Kirkcudbrightshire-based scallops dredger, was operated in a safe manner between November 2007 and April 2012.
The court heard he was not being blamed for the loss of one of his crewmen.
The body of Mr Robertson, of Dalbeattie, who never knew that his partner was pregnant, has never been recovered.
Speaking after sentencing, Mr Robertson's father Craig Robertson said: "It is understandable that they cannot blame him [Baird] for what happened to my son.
"We don't know what happened. We never will. Everything that could be done has now been done."
