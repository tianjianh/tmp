Amelia Jones: accused Mark Jones 'didn't like' baby's dad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has given evidence against her own father, who is accused of murdering her five-week-old daughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sarah Jones, 26,  told Newport Crown Court her father, Mark Jones, "didn't like" Amelia Jones's dad, Ian Skillern.
Mr Jones denies murdering his granddaughter, Amelia, three years ago.
Ms Jones told the court she started dating Mr Skillern in 2011 and he and her father got on "alright in the beginning", but eventually they would "stay out of each other's way".
She said Mr Jones "didn't like him, he didn't like the fact he used to to the pub and drink and he wasn't at home".
She added that she had been largely estranged from her father until 2011, when he came back into her life.
Earlier the court heard from pathologist Deryk James that Amelia suffered rib fractures about two weeks before she died, but he could not be certain of the exact date of older injuries he found during a post-mortem examination.
The court had heard Amelia died of a fractured skull and brain injuries. Prosecutors said Mr Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, also fractured her ribs and bones in her legs.
However Dr James told the court Amelia could have fractured her skull as the result of a fall of 80cm, even onto carpet, and it could have happened a day or two before she was taken to hospital on Sunday 17 November 2012 in a state of cardiac arrest.
Defending, Roger Thomas QC told the court Mr Jones was "in charge of the baby when the fatal situation developed".
Amelia was 41 days old when she died at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff on 19 November 2012.
The trial continues.
