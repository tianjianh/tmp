Jonathan Hogg: Huddersfield Town midfielder 'lucky' to have Wembley chance

Huddersfield's Jonathan Hogg feels "lucky" to be involved in Monday's Championship play-off final, two months after fearing he had broken his neck.

Hogg was carried off at Bristol City in March after colliding with a team-mate but returned to action 19 days later.
"I thought the season was over," Hogg, who is set to start against Reading at Wembley, told BBC Radio Leeds.
"I feel so lucky to be able to help the lads out and hopefully be a Premier League player next year."
Midfielder Hogg, 28, had been taken to hospital after his accidental clash with Mark Hudson in the first half of the Terriers' 4-0 defeat at Ashton Gate on 17 March.
He was initially thought to have had a fracture in his cervical spine but further scans gave him the all-clear to resume training on 2 April, before he started the 3-0 win over Norwich three days later.
"When the specialist said I had a fracture in my spine, my heart skipped a beat," Hogg said.
"It was certainly a scary experience and something I don't wish upon anyone.
"But to be back and to help the lads get where we are today and be part of it, I'm quite proud of myself to be honest."
Hogg, who further showed his durability when he ended Huddersfield's play-off semi-final win over Sheffield Wednesday with a bandaged head, has a score to settle with Wembley.
He was part of the Watford side that lost the 2013 Championship play-off final to Crystal Palace and hopes the experience will spur him on to help Huddersfield into the top flight for the first time in 45 years.
"The second time you do anything, you find it a bit easier," Hogg said.
"You get used to your surroundings, the dressing room and the pitch. I think it'll stand me in good stead for the game coming.
"We've got some experienced lads, who have had finals and semi-finals in Germany.
"The occasion can certainly get the better of people but I'm hoping our lads stand strong and just play the match."
Both league matches between the two sides this season were decided by a solitary goal.
Hogg added: "When it does get tough, I think we have got the players to grind it out. We've also got quality going forward.
"We've got a great bond and our dressing room is one of the strongest I've been in. We've proved a lot of people wrong this year and I think we thoroughly deserve to be where we are.
"Whoever turns up on the day will be Premier League players next year, the others will have to fight it out in the Championship again."
