After starting the day on 61-2 in response to the Warriors' 302, Ireland spinner Dockrell showed his all-rounder credentials with his fine knock.
Lorcan Tucker also hit 61 with Eddie Richardson unbeaten on 50.
The Warriors reached 53-0 as the match ended in its inevitable draw.
After rain meant no play on the first day, Oraine Williams hit 121 in the Warriors' first innings at Malahide.
After Tuesday's wash-out, Williams' knock helped the Warriors post 302 all-out on Wednesday with Craig Young's 36 bringing the visitors over the 300 mark.
Leinster only needed to avoid defeat to earn a second straight clean sweep of inter-Pro trophies.
Williams and debutant Graham Kennedy put on 110 for the sixth wicket after the Warriors had been in a degree of trouble at 67-4.
