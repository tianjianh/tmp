Uber loses court battle over English tests for drivers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uber has lost its UK case against new rules that would require its drivers to pass English language tests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ride-hailing firm had previously won the right to challenge Transport for London (TfL) in court over the assessments.
Uber had argued the tests could put a third of its drivers out of business.
"TfL are entitled to require private hire drivers to demonstrate English language compliance," said judge John Mitting when he rejected Uber's claim.
