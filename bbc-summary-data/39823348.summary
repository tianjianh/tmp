"A 17 [seat] majority is as much as I expected us to get," Mr Rushton said.
"We've got some tough times ahead, we've dealt with tough times in the past, and I feel certain we'll deal with the tough times going forward.
"I can promise the electorate the Conservative administration will represent you all, irrespective of whether you voted for us."
The leader of UKIP in the county, David Sprason - who is also the party's national spokesman on welfare and social care - lost his seat to Conservative Peter Bedford.
The Tory win means the party has won control of the authority for the fifth election in a row.
