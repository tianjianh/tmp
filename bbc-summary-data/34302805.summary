[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boa constrictor - a species known for holding its prey in a lethal grip - went missing from a house in Kells, Whitehaven, on Friday evening.
Cumbria Police said the household pet made off after being left unattended while being cleaned.
A spokesman said the animal did not pose an immediate risk, but urged people not to approach it.
Boa constrictors are commonly found in tropical forests in South America.
They are from the family of constricting snakes, which kill their prey through asphyxiation and can grow to more than 9ft (2.7 metres) long.
Anyone who sees the snake has been urged to contact the police.
