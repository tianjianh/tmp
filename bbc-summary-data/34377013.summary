They say a court in the US state of Georgia ordered a medical examiner to seal the results.
Bobbi Kristina, 22, died at a hospice on 26 July, six months after she was found unresponsive in a bath in her Atlanta flat.
Houston drowned in a bath in 2012.
She died at a Los Angeles hotel on the eve of the Grammy Awards ceremony.
In a statement, the Fulton county medical examiner said Bobbi Kristina's post-mortem results would not be publicly released on the order of the Fulton county superior court.
"The Fulton County medical examiner has classified the cause and manner of Bobbi Kristina Brown's death," it said.
Bobbi Kristina was the only child of singer Whitney Houston and her father was R&B singer Bobby Brown.
She was buried in August at the Fairview cemetery in Westfield, New Jersey, next to her mother.
Bobbi Kristina Brown began performing with her mother in 1999, singing duets of My Love is Your Love and recording Little Drummer Boy for a holiday album in 2003.
