Yiannoulla Yianni's body was found by her family at their home in Belsize Road, Hampstead.
The 56-year-old man from Golders Green, arrested on Tuesday, has been detained on an unrelated matter, police said.
Yiannoulla was a student of Quintin Kynaston School in St John's Wood.
Recounting the events of 13 August 1982, police said the teenager had spent the morning at home with her mother before they went to the family's shop nearby at about 12:30 BST to have lunch with Yiannoulla's father and brother.
About an hour later the schoolgirl returned home to prepare dinner while her mother stayed back at the shop.
Her parents found her body when they returned home at about 15:00 that afternoon, police said. She had been raped and strangled.
Det Insp Julie Willats, of the Met's Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: "The Met never close unsolved murders and regardless of the passage of time cases can and will be reviewed, for any new opportunities to develop previously unknown lines of enquiry, and follow-up any fresh information which has become known to us.
"Yiannoulla's family - who understandably are still devastated by the loss of their beloved daughter and sister more than three decades ago - have been fully informed of this new development."
More than 1,000 witness statements were taken in the case which has been periodically reviewed, but an arrest has never been made until now.
