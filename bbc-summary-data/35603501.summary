Since 2000 the tournament has culminated in March, with Ross County and Hibernian meeting in this season's final at Hampden next month.
Plans for a competition reformat were announced last year, beginning in July and with group stages introduced.
It has also been confirmed that the planned three-week winter break for the Premiership will start immediately after the new-year fixture round.
Top-flight teams will return to action in the Scottish Cup fourth round on the weekend of 21 January.
"The Scottish League Cup semi-finals and final will again be contested before the end of the year, which we know is something a large number of supporters and stakeholders, including the media, were very keen on," said Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster.
