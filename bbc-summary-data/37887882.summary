The former world number two overcame a sluggish start to win five successive games to take the opening set.
She controlled the second as Svitolina failed to find the form that beat Johanna Konta in the semi-finals.
Kvitova, 26, will play for the Czech Republic in the Fed Cup final against France starting on Saturday.
The WTA Elite Trophy featured the leading 12 players who did not qualify for last week's WTA Finals in Singapore.
