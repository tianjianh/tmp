[SN]TITLE[SN]
Register missing at Oxford polling station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Early morning voters at an Oxford polling station were unable to cast their ballots because part of the electoral register was missing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incomplete list at Rose Hill Methodist Church meant some voters arriving in the first hour had to wait while a replacement was delivered.
The full electoral register arrived by 08:10 BST.
Oxford City Council apologised for the inconvenience. All polling stations are open until 22:00 BST.
