A lifeboat station is back in service, four days after 25 volunteers resigned in protest against the sacking of a senior crew member.

The RNLI says six crew members have been brought in from the UK to staff the St Helier station in Jersey.
The charity said the decision to remove coxswain Andy Hibbs was made due to a "serious risk to its ability to run a safe and effective lifesaving service".
Mr Hibbs denies the claim he broke the volunteers' code of conduct.

The St Helier station was unmanned for the weekend and members of the public attended a silent protest on Sunday.
The charity says the new crew members have come from various parts of the UK, and will remain until the dispute is resolved.
