David Moyes: Sunderland manager charged with misconduct by FA

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland manager David Moyes has been charged with misconduct after being sent off at Southampton on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Football Association said it is alleged "Moyes used abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official".
The incident occurred in the 90th minute, after referee Chris Kavanagh waved away appeals for a foul on Sunderland striker Victor Anichebe in the penalty area.
Sunderland lost the EFL Cup match 1-0.
Moyes, who was appointed Black Cats boss in July and has managed only two points from nine league games, has until 18:00 BST on Tuesday to respond.
