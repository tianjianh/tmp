The boy was found "safe" this afternoon and arrested on suspicion of wounding and carrying a bladed weapon.
Police said he was found on a train from Hereford to Malvern at 16:55 BST.
Detectives launched a search for the boy after the attack at Chase Technology College in Malvern, Worcestershire, at about 08:45 BST.
A male teacher and 13-year-old girl suffered minor injuries.
The boy was apprehended at Ledbury station in Herefordshire.
Leah Johnson, 16, a former pupil of Chase College, was travelling on the train when it stopped at Ledbury.
She said an officer was waiting on the platform for the boy, who had been standing near the train doors for around 15 minutes.
"The policeman was pacing up and down. The doors opened and he just said 'can you come with me?' and he walked off with him," she said.
The boy remains in custody at Worcester Police Station.
Earlier, there were police officers stationed at each entrance to the school and crime scene tape blocking off the main entrance.
Children were brought out individually from the school and handed to parents waiting at the gates. About 100 had gathered by lunchtime.
