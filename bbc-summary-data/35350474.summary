Renault to modify 15,000 new cars in emission scare

French carmaker Renault, which has been under the spotlight over high levels of harmful emissions, is recalling 15,000 new cars.

The move comes after tests showed emission levels from some of its vehicles were too high.
Last week, three of the firm's sites were raided by fraud investigators.
The searches led to billions of euros being wiped off its market value, after fears that it could be another scandal similar to that at Volkswagen.
Renault has promised to come up with a "technical plan" to bring down the level of emissions from its vehicles.
French Energy Minister Segolene Royal said Renault was not the only car company in France to break the rules on carbon dioxide and nitrogen emissions, but she did not name the others involved.
She said the tests needed to be based on real driving conditions and not those of special testing facilities. It has been suggested that the emission readings are much lower in laboratory-style conditions.
"Renault has committed to recalling a certain number of vehicles, more than 15,000 vehicles, to check them and adjust them correctly so the filtration system works even when it is very hot or when it is below 17 degrees, because that's when the filtration system no longer worked," Ms Royal said.
"We are working on a technical plan which should allow us to cut emissions," Renault sales director Thierry Koskas said during a presentation on the group's 2015 sales performance.
When asked how the test results differed from those conducted under real conditions, he said: "Renault did not cheat... We are not using any software or other methods."
