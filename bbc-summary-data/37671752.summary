Tesco is facing legal action from staff who say they lost out on pay for working anti-social hours.

The complaint is from 17 workers who are "extremely unhappy" at seeing their pay rates change for weekends, bank holidays and night shifts.
Leigh Day, the law firm acting for the workers, estimated thousands of long-term Tesco staff, mainly in their 40s, could be affected.
Tesco said workers would receive a "transition payment" for the changes.
The employees have started the process towards making a claim in an employment tribunal, according to Leigh Day.
Pay changes announced by Tesco in February included an hourly wage rise, but also cuts to the rates paid to some Sunday and bank holiday staff.
Under the changes, staff would receive time and a half for Sunday and bank holiday shifts from July, whereas previously some had received double time.
A Tesco spokesperson said: "The minority of colleagues who were negatively impacted by this change were supported with an agreed lump sum transition payment."
Paula Lee from Leigh Day said its clients, who have worked for Tesco for at least 16 years, felt "their loyalty was being taken advantage of".
She said: "Our clients are extremely unhappy that they have had their wages reduced in this way.
"These long-serving employees are especially angry that they only found out about the decision when news was leaked to the national press in January 2016.
"They feel hurt, bewildered and frightened that this could happen again."
The law firm claims a night premium was also scrapped.
