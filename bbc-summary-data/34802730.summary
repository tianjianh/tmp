Six Nations holders Ireland were competing in the autumn internationals for the first time, while England lost 11-0 against France last weekend in the first of their two matches.
The hosts were 3-0 ahead at half-time through Lauren Cattell's penalty, before captain Niamh Briggs levelled.
But Izzy Noel-Smith touched down from a driving maul to win it late on.
