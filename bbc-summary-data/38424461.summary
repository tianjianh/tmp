[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plymouth Argyle 2-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Second-half goals from Oscar Threlkeld and substitute Craig Tanner were enough for Plymouth to beat Crawley and move back to the top of League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Collins had the best chance of the first half, dinking over for the visitors when through one-on-one.
The Pilgrims went ahead when David Fox's cross was not suitably cleared and fell to Threlkeld to finish.
Crawley's Jordan Roberts forced Luke McCormick into a diving save, but Tanner netted on the counter late on.
Doncaster's draw at Mansfield means Argyle are now two points clear at the summit and six games unbeaten, while Dermot Drummy's side drop to 15th.
The Red Devils were led by assistant boss Matt Gray at Home Park, as Drummy did not travel to Devon due to illness.
