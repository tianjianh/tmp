Kenneth Walker chatted with the fictitious teenager online, and travelled to Newcastle to meet her.
However, the fake profile had been set up by the group Dark Justice, which contacted police on his arrival.
The 37-year-old, from Nottingham, pleaded guilty to attempting to meet a girl following sexual grooming and was jailed for three-and-a-half years.
The judge at Newcastle Crown Court also ordered him to be put on the sex offenders register for life.
The court heard Walker had contacted "Roxy" on a chat website and asked her if she was "looking for a boyfriend or sex".
Despite her reply that she was aged 13, almost 14, the conversation on Walker's side turned sexual, and he sent her explicit photographs.
On 17 April, he travelled by coach to Newcastle, bringing a blanket, alcohol and contraceptives with him.
Defence lawyer Jeff Taylor described Walker as a "very, very, very sad individual who led a solitary existence".
"His communication with the outside world appears to be with a computer because he can't communicate with individuals," he said.
Sentencing, Judge Jamie Hill QC told Walker: "It was said on your behalf that you're not a predatory paedophile, but when the opportunity was put your way, you seized it."
