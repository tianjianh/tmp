Martyn Uzzell A65 death: North Yorkshire County Council settles with widow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The widow of a cyclist who died after he hit a pothole on his bike has received a six-figure payout from a council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martyn Uzzell, from North Somerset, was thrown into the path of a car after hitting the pothole.
An inquest heard North Yorkshire County Council had missed opportunities to repair the A65 in Giggleswick.
His wife Kate has now reached a settlement with the authority after she launched a civil action against it.
In a statement, the council said while it "accepts no liability for the tragic death of Mr Uzzell", it appreciated the case was "a sensitive matter".
It confirmed it had settled with Mrs Uzzell to avoid "prolonged involvement in further litigation".
Mr Uzzell, 51, from Clevedon, was on a charity ride from Land's End to John O'Groats with two friends in 2011 when the accident happened.
