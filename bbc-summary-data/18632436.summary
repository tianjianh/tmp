"BMX is a very exciting and fast-paced sport that is made for television. It is great that London 2012 gives the generation who discovered the sport as kids the chance to now show it to their children. Team GB are in with a good chance of medals. Shanaze Reade is the great British hope in the women's. At her core she is an outstanding individual and has lots of talent; she could win hands down. Liam Phillips's broken collarbone won't be too difficult to get over physically and he could make the final. He will be competing against the USA's Connor Fields, who is without question the stand-out male rider."
Over a series of qualifying heats, riders have to navigate a course full of humps, bumps and jumps while trying to outmanoeuvre - and avoid crashing into - their opponents.
The drama is heightened by a winner-takes-all one-run final.
BMX has come along way from the skate parks and dirt roads it was first popularised on in Britain in the 1980s, and Crewe-born Shanaze Reade is a genuine contender to become a home-grown gold medal winner.
Anyone looking to replicate the competitor's adrenaline-fuelled moves will get their chance after the Games closes as the 400m BMX Track is to be opened to the public as part of the Velopark in the Olympic Park.
The effort of riding a BMX bike at speed for an hour can burn approximately 610 calories. This not only helps aid weight loss but increases endurance, promotes agility, develops physical coordination and builds muscle strength.
Pedalling a BMX bike strengthens and tones various leg muscles, while lifting the handlebars to perform tricks can increase muscle mass in the biceps and triceps.
Whether practising to compete in races or perform tricks, BMX boosts self-discipline, motivation, self-esteem and confidence.
Training sessions are an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people. Clubs also offer a variety of social events beyond simply taking part in the sport.
There are currently more than 50 dedicated BMX tracks throughout the UK. Find your local club by using British Cycling's club finder.
It is essential to wear safety equipment such as a full-face helmet, cycling gloves and elbow and knee pads. It is recommended that trousers and a long sleeved top be worn for added protection.

In changes from the rules in place at the Beijing Olympics, the time trial phase used to determine the seedings for the elimination stages now sees each rider have one run instead of two. The men's quarter-finals comprise five runs instead of three.
Maris Strombergs of Latvia rode to the first ever Olympic gold in the men's BMX cycling event. Strombergs led throughout, beating Americans Mike Day and Donny Robinson into silver and bronze. Day dominated the quarter-final and semi-final rounds, but he could not keep pace with Strombergs in a crash-filled, incident-packed final. The Latvian rider's win gave his country its first gold of the Games.
In each run, the athlete who finishes first gets one point, second placed gets two points, and so on.
After three runs in the quarter-final stage, the top two riders (those with the lowest number of points) qualify for the semi-finals. The remaining riders in each quarter-final continue for two more runs, after which the top two riders (calculated from all five runs) will qualify for the semi-finals.
The semi-finals for both men and women are held over three runs, in which the top four riders from each semi-final will advance to the final.
If a photo finish cannot break a tie within a run, the riders share the same place and points. This includes the finals, where medals will be shared.
If two or more riders within the same heat have the same number of points after their three or five runs, ties are broken in descending order of importance by: Points in run five (if applicable), points in run four (if applicable), points in run three, points in run two, points in run one, and by gate selection order of run one.
In the elimination phase, riders have the opportunity to choose which gate they start from. For the first run in the elimination phase, the gate selection order is determined by the rank from the seeding run.
The gate selection order for subsequent runs is determined by the points scored in the previous run (ties are broken by rank in the seeding run). The gate selection order for the final is determined by the fastest time from the last run in the semi-finals (ties are broken by rank in the seeding run).
