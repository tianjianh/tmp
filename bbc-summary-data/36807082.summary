Allied Bakeries said the decision to close the Chester Road site in Saltney is part of an efficiency review.
The company has started formal consultations with staff and unions.
It said it hoped jobs could be found in other parts of the business or the wider parent company, Associated British Foods.
"We are currently consulting with our employees and their union representatives about these proposals, which if accepted would, regrettably, result in 53 people being placed at risk of redundancy," said a spokesman for the breadmakers.
"We understand that this will be a difficult and unsettling time for our employees and their families.
"If the proposals are accepted every effort will be made to help those people affected secure alternative employment, either within other parts of Allied Bakeries operations, or externally in the local area."
The company added that the decision "in no way reflect the commitment and efforts of those affected".
The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union said it would be meeting management from Allied Bakeries next Wednesday.
