Paramedic struck off for ignoring dying Walsall patient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paramedic has been struck off for failing to treat a man who collapsed in a hospital car park and later died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Davies was found guilty of misconduct by a health profession panel for not helping Carl Cope in the car park of Walsall Manor Hospital.
Mr Cope, 47, later died in hospital of a heart attack in June 2012.
The panel heard four members of clinical staff were present at the time and all were charged with failure to care for a patient in need.

The Health and Care Professions Council panel heard Mr Davies had been dismissed by his employer, West Midlands Ambulance Service, for gross misconduct.
It followed an investigation into a failure to provide care to Mr Cope on 23 June 2012.
Panel chair Naseem Malik said: "Mr Davies's failure to act was conduct falling far below that expected by the public, his profession, and fellow practitioners.
"There is, in the panel's view, insufficient evidence that Mr Davies has gained meaningful insight into his failings. In the absence of such insight there remains a likelihood of repetition of the misconduct."
Mr Davies, who was not present or represented at the hearing, was struck off the HCPC Register.
In February last year, paramedic Matthew Geary, 36, from Manor Avenue in Great Wyrley, Staffordshire, admitted failing to discharge a duty in relation to Mr Cope's treatment,
He was given an eight-month suspended jail term.
