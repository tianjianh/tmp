The total number of fans attending Scottish Professional Football League games, including play-offs, was up to 4,267,467 from 3,804,342 in 2015-16.
It is the first time attendances have topped the four million mark since the 2008-09 campaign (4,252,212).
"These figures are hugely encouraging," said SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster.
"It is testament both to the hard work of clubs in attracting people to games as well as the commitment and passion of supporters of all 42 clubs.
"There is already a great level of excitement ahead of SPFL season 2017-18 with many of our clubs executing some very creative season ticket marketing campaigns to help attract even more fans to attend matches regularly.
"All of this sends out a very positive message and provides a great platform to improve the overall profile and health of Scottish football."
