Patterdale terrier Taz became trapped beneath a concrete terrace at Bath City FC on Thursday night.
Crews from Bath Fire Station had to remove part of the stand at the Twerton Park ground to get to the dog.
A spokesman for Avon Fire and Rescue said: "Once crews reached the terrier they found he was still pinched between the bottom of the stand and soil and rubble below."
The spokesman added: "Firefighters were able to dig out the ground around Taz before pulling him to safety through the gap.
"Once free, he was reunited, unhurt, with his extremely grateful owners."
Bath City have been approached for comment.
