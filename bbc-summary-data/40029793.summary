The actor was asked by Australian morning TV show sunrise if there was any truth to the rumours about a sequel to the 1986 military action film.
"It's true, it's true," he replied. "I'm going to start filming it probably in the next year. It's happening."
The original film launched Cruise's career and took more than $350m (Â£270m) globally at the box office.
The actor played the cocky pilot Maverick in the movie, one of the top students at a US training camp for elite military fighter pilots.
The film also starred Val Kilmer, Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, Tom Skerrit and Kelly McGillis.
Last week, Top Gun producer Jerry Bruckheimer tweeted a photo with Cruise, on the 31st anniversary of the opening day of the film.
In January 2016, Bruckheimer tweeted: "Just got back from a weekend in New Orleans to see my old friend @TomCruise and discuss a little Top Gun 2."
