Barcelona: Nou Camp capacity to rise to 105,000 by 2021

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barcelona have unveiled plans to remodel their Nou Camp stadium with the capacity rising to 105,000 by the 2021-22 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A joint bid by Japanese architecture company Nikken Sekkei and a Catalan studio won the tender to remodel the home of the La Liga champions.
The Nou Camp has a capacity of 99,354 and is the biggest stadium in Europe.
The redevelopment will also see the roof ring the entire stadium with all the seats being under cover.
Work is scheduled to start in the 2017-18 season and will not prevent the club from hosting games.
