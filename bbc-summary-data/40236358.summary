The British number four was leading Germany's Dustin Brown 6-3 4-2 when he began hopping in pain after pushing off on his left leg to return a serve.
Evans, 27, will have a scan on Monday, with the start of Wimbledon, where he reached round three last year, just three weeks away.
Fellow Briton Heather Watson is through to the final of the women's event.
Watson defeated compatriot Harriet Dart 6-1 6-2 and will play Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova in Sunday's final.
