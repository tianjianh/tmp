Daly replaces lock Courtney Lawes in the only change from the squad that beat Italy.
"Elliot Daly has impressed in training and is now ready to be part of the matchday 23," Jones said.
England won their opening two matches and top the table, while Ireland lost to France and drew with Wales.
Daly, 23, has played four times for England Saxons and also represented England at under-18 and under-20 level.
Ireland could also bring a debutant into midfield, with Ulster's Stuart McCloskey in contention for a first cap if fitness-doubt Jared Payne is ruled out.
