An unlikely dream came true for a teenage refugee when a US soap star filmed a special scene in her honour.

Noujain Mustaffa is a disabled 16-year-old Syrian migrant with an unwavering smile who made the odyssey to Europe in her wheelchair.
She told journalists she had learnt English by watching the US soap opera, Days of Our Lives.
Now one of its characters - played by James Scott - has "returned from the dead" in a spoof paying tribute.
Noujain was one of hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have undertaken the arduous 4,000-mile (6,400km) journey to Europe in recent months.
But her courage in attempting the journey in her wheelchair - and her unshakeable optimism - captured the attention of the world's media, initially the BBC's Fergal Keane.
Noujain revealed that her accomplished English was down to watching her favourite TV show, the long-running US daytime drama Days of Our Lives, back in her home town of Kobane.
"I was waking up at 08:00 some days to watch it. That's a great show," she told BBC partner ABC. "But they killed the main character that I loved!"
That lament came to the attention of comedian John Oliver, who picked up on Noujain's story at the end of a segment examining Europe's treatment of the migrants on the latest edition of his late-night show, Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.
"How could you not want this girl in your country?" he asked.
"We have a surprise that is literally just for you," he went on - introducing a specially filmed spoof scene in which Noujain's favourite character, EJ DiMera, played by Scott, returns from the dead to be reunited with his former lover, Sami.
"Coming back from the dead, that's not hard," EJ tells Sami - played by Alison Sweeney - during the scene. "You know what's hard? Getting from Syria to Germany."
"Have you seen what those migrants are going through?" Sami responds.
Later, EJ says: "I read about this incredible 16-year-old girl from Kobani called Noujain Mustaffa. Yes, Noujain Mustaff," he says, looking into the camera with a smile.
Scott later tweeted his thanks to Last Week Tonight, Alison Sweeney and Noujain for "one last DiMera dance!"
Noujain, meanwhile, succeeded in reaching Germany where she was reunited with her brother. She has now applied for asylum in Dortmund.
