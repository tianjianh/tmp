Women's Super League One: Notts County Ladies 0-2 Arsenal Ladies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Asisat Oshoala's double saw Arsenal Ladies beat Notts County to boost their chances of securing Champions League football next season, despite having only 10 players for the last half hour.

Notts edged a tight first half lacking clear-cut chances, but Arsenal led when Oshoala profited from a poor backpass to run through and slot home.
Gunners goalkeeper Emma Byrne was then sent off for bringing down Ellen White.
But Oshoala's shot sealed the win after a mistake by goalkeeper Megan Walsh.
The victory means Arsenal still have a remote chance of winning the league on goal difference.
But they would need to win all of their remaining four Women's Super League games and hope unbeaten leaders Man City lose all three of theirs - as well as overturning a goal difference of 18.
However, Arsenal are only two points behind second-placed Chelsea giving the Gunners a much more realistic chance to play in Europe next season.
The Blues - who thrashed Birmingham earlier on Sunday - have played a game less, but still have to meet Manchester City.
Arsenal defender Casey Stoney:
"It was a great result and pleasing when you go down to ten. If I'm honest it was probably one of our poorest performances of the season.
"It was more their errors than our creativity but having said that, you'll take three points here and it means we've beaten them four times this season.
"We've played in games this season where we have dominated and ended up losing so it was a reverse of that today and we were clinical when we needed to be.
"We'll keep fighting for the Champions League and keep trying to win games. We're relying on other teams to do us a favour but whilst were still up there, we'll keep going."
Notts manager Rick Passmoor:
"It's disappointing because you can legislate for individual errors and that's what it was.
"We were on top for long periods and they were hitting us on the counter attack, which they looked very dangerous on. However, I'm really pleased with everything apart from them two sloppy mistakes.
"It's good to see that we are performing again, it's good to see that we are putting a marker down but we need to take that into the next five games."
