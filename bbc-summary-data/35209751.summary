A yellow 'be aware' rain weather warning has been dropped after being issued for parts of Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spells of heavy rain had been expected to continue across mid, south and west Wales after the Met Office issued a warning from 18:00 GMT on Friday.
But on Saturday, the chief forecaster said the worst of the rain had passed for now.
A heavy band of rain is still expected on Sunday.
Natural Resources Wales has one flood warning in place for the Lower Dee Valley, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows, as well as four flood alerts.
