Paul Cox: Hartlepool United open talks with Barrow manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegated League Two side Hartlepool United have been given permission to speak to Barrow manager Paul Cox about their vacant managerial position, reports BBC Radio Cumbria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 45-year-old led the Cumbrian side to seventh in the National League this season, seven points off the play-offs.
Pools defender Matthew Bates had been in caretaker charge of the side after Dave Jones left in April.
Barrow owner Paul Casson has stated Cox has a sizeable buy-out clause.
Hartlepool's relegation on the final day of the season meant they dropped out of the Football League for the first time in 96 years.
