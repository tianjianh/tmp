Dickie, 20, can play at centre-half or right-back and spent much of last term on loan with the Robins, helping them win promotion from the National League.
He scored three goals in his 27 league appearances last term and has played one senior game for the Royals.
"It's very good to be back. I know what the manager wants and I'll do my best," Dickie told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
Meanwhile, striker Dan Holman has been sidelined for up to eight weeks with a toe injury he sustained in pre-season.
The 26-year-old - who scored 16 goals in 18 games for Cheltenham last season - played with the injury for three matches at the start of this campaign but the results of a scan have ruled him out until October.
