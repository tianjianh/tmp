The 48-hour Global Game Jam is an international event where game developers work to a set theme to inspire their designs.
Abertay University is hosting the Dundee event for the fourth time.
Last year, more than 5,000 new games were created in one weekend, with 78 different countries taking part.
Almost 21,000 people have registered to take part at 636 separate locations across 93 countries this year.
This year, there is a sister site at Dundee MakerSpace where a further 50 participants will gather.
Each year's theme is announced at the start of the event, which organisers say is not a competition, but a focus on creativity and collaboration.
In 2015 the theme was "what do we do now?", while 2014's was "we don't see things as they are, we see them as we are".
Ryan Locke, Abertay University lecturer in computer arts, said: "We are delighted to be hosting our fourth Global Game Jam event and very much looking forward to the fun, beautiful and often meaningful ideas our students produce during these intensive creative events.
"We're also very happy to have many industry bodies and alumni take part. They play an important role in helping to guide and inspire new talent which is vital to the wider game making ecology of Dundee and Scotland."
