Plans to build a supermarket on a former brewery site in Cumbria have been given the go-ahead.

Proposals for the store in Brewery Street in Ulverston were put on hold last year after campaigners opposing the scheme won the right for a judicial review into the planning permission.
Keep Ulverston Special said the store would "suck away" trade from the town.
Members of South Lakeland District Council's planning committee voted in favour of the proposals on Thursday.
Ulverston councillor Janette Jenkinson said: "I will be supporting this because I don't want to see Ulverston become the dormant town to Barrow which is what will happen if we don't actually attract more footfall and more visitors to the town."
The plans would involve demolishing much of the old Robinson's brewery site and building the 20,000 sq ft store, which would be rented out to a major supermarket chain.
Keep Ulverston Special said the development would "utterly destroy" the heritage brewery site and many shops would close as they would not be able to withstand the diversion of trade from a supermarket.
Speaking after the meeting, campaigner Cerri Hutton said: "Planning committees are human beings and I don't think they liked being challenged and I don't think they liked being found wrong.
"Looking at that and the failure to grapple with the real issues that they should have grappled with, I think a lot of that was to do with feeling slightly sore to be honest about what had happened before."
