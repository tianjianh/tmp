The 28-year-old joined the club from Wakefield in 2012 after two previous loan spells.
Dean, who began his career at St Helens, scored eight tries in his 27 appearances last term as Widnes reached the play-offs for the first time.
"Retaining a player like Chris is fantastic for the club," head coach Denis Betts told the club website.
"Chris is the type of player that all great clubs are built on. To secure a player of his quality will only add to the strength of the team."
