The club said in a statement that the 30-year-old had appeared at Bath Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
"The club takes matters such as this very seriously.
"It does not condone behaviour of this sort, and can confirm that Faosiliva has been suspended pending conclusion of the judicial process.
"Bath Rugby will not be making any further comment until the conclusion of this process."
Faosiliva joined Bath in 2013.
He has won 15 caps for Samoa, including making two appearances at last year's World Cup when he lined up against the United States and Scotland.
He is expected to be sentenced in May.
