Brett Rogers, 23, denies the murder of Gillian Phillips, 54, and David Oakes, 60, who were fatally stabbed in Stansted Mountfitchet, Essex, in 2015.
He punched and struggled with Chelmsford Crown Court guards while a forensic scientist was giving evidence.
An ambulance was called for the injured male and female officers.

Judge Mrs Justice Whipple, who witnessed the incident along with the jury, told the court Mr Rogers had offered an apology for his behaviour when the trial resumed.
"This trial is going to continue and I don't want you to hold that incident against the defendant in any way," she said.
Mr Rogers' father, who was in the public gallery, shouted to his son to "stop it" during the court session on 5 May.
The court previously heard how Mr Rogers had been jailed for assaulting his father Peter, leaving him with a broken eye socket, and was on licence at the time of the killings.
The jury also heard Mr Rogers was found at his mother's home in Bentfield Gardens in July 2015 laughing and covered in blood.
Forensic scientist Judith Cunnison told the court seven knives found at the scene had been examined, many of them with Mr Roger's DNA on the handles, along with that of Mrs Phillips and Mr Oakes.
She also showed the jury a T-shirt belonging to Mr Rogers and two pairs of his trainers, concluding: "I made particular efforts to see if [any blood DNA] could be attributed to another party and I couldn't see any indications of anybody else's DNA there."
The trial continues.
