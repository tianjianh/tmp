Vasectomy blunder doctor Nanikram Vaswani admits misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital doctor who gave a patient a vasectomy by mistake has admitted a raft of misconduct charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Nanikram Vaswani should have removed scar tissue from the patient at Broadgreen Hospital in Liverpool but he performed the vasectomy instead.
The doctor has admitted four counts of misconduct before a Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service hearing.
A panel will consider whether Dr Vaswani should be allowed to continue to practise.
Among the other failings listed in the charges was a failure to confirm the patient's identity and a failure to tell a urologist and his NHS Trust about the incorrect procedure.
The doctor also admitted "inappropriately" performing a vasectomy reversal procedure on the same patient.
The hearing was told this procedure was not routinely carried out in the hospital and the doctor admitted he had not performed it for approximately five years.
It heard he carried out the reversal when the patient "was physically and emotionally traumatised and/or likely to be so, in light of what had just taken place with the first procedure".
