The evacuees were flown back on Thursday morning on two air force planes from Djibouti.
They were earlier picked up by an Indian navy ship from Aden and taken to Djibouti.
A Saudi Arabian-led coalition has been targeting rebels in Yemen in support of President Abdabbuh Mansour Hadi.
The two planes carrying the evacuees landed in the cities of Mumbai and Kochi, from where people will travel to their homes.
The majority of the Indians, including more than 100 women and 25 children, come from the southern state of Kerala.
"I was scared when a missile or a bomb hit our hostel building. We were moved to the hospital. I was really scared. I just wanted to, somehow, return to India,'' Celina Iby, who worked as a nurse for over seven years in Aden, told BBC Hindi.
Simi, who worked for a hospital in Aden, said local authorities were helpful.
"They gave back our passports and even arranged transport for us to reach the port to board the ship to Djibouti. But they did not give last month's salary and [the] experience certificate,'' she said.
Reports say two more navy ships are expected to reach Yemen by Thursday to rescue other Indians, who are mainly stranded in Aden and Sanaa.
There are some 4,000 Indian workers, businessmen and nurses working in Yemen.
Yemen has suffered from political instability for years and Shia Houthi rebels control nine of the 21 provinces.
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace President Hadi's government, which they accuse of being corrupt.
