The 20-year-old midfielder has played 23 games for the Wings during two previous loan spells.
"It's the best decision for me at this moment in my career - to play games and do the best that I can," Lee told Welling's website.
Welling are currently in the National League relegation zone, just two places off the bottom of the table.
"There are goals in the team and everyone's spirits are high. I 100% believe we will stay up," Lee said.
