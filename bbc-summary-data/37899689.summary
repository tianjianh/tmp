The yellow 'be aware' warning is in place from 15:00 on Tuesday until 10:00 on Wednesday, slightly later times than previously forecast.
The update also extends to more parts of England and Wales.
Most of Scotland is likely to be affected, with the exception of Orkney and Shetland, with upland areas expected to have snowfalls.
Hilly areas over 300m can expect up to 15cm of snow, while lower levels could potentially see snowfall later on Tuesday.
Temperatures of 3-4C are forecast across the central belt, with milder weather in the North East.
As the snow moves east on Tuesday evening, it is possible that higher parts of the M8, A9 and M74 could face disruption.
The Met Office said the snow was likely to peter out across Scotland on Wednesday morning.
