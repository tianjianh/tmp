[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An SNP election candidate has confirmed that "administrative matters" relating to her time as a solicitor are being checked by the Law Society of Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who won the Ochil and South Perthshire seat for the SNP in 2015, said she was proud of her 17-year career in the legal profession.
An SNP spokesman said: "Hundreds of issues are raised with the Law Society every year and it is right that they investigate them."
The Law Society would not comment.
In a statement Ms Ahmed-Sheikh said: "I am aware that issues have been raised with the Law Society in relation to administrative matters during my time at my former firm.
"The Law Society has a duty to uphold professional standards and they must be allowed to do so without prejudice."
The SNP spokesman added that she had "co-operated fully" with the investigation and was continuing her campaign to be returned as the MP for Ochil and South Perthshire.
The Law Society did confirm Ms Ahmed-Sheikh remained on the roll of solicitors but did not currently hold a practising certificate.
The 46-year-old worked as a solicitor before she won the seat at the last general election, with a majority of 10,168 votes.
Perth and Kinross Council has not yet published a full list of candidates standing in Ochil and South Perthshire but others include:
Ilyan Stefanov (Lib Dem), Luke Graham (Con) and Joanne Ross (Lab)
