EastEnders fans will FINALLY find out who killed Lucy Beale this evening across two episodes on BBC One.

But viewers of Wednesday's episode had another burning question. Who is Adam?
It's after Jo Joyner, who returned to the show as Tanya Branning, referred to Ian Beale, played by Adam Woodyatt, by his real name during a live scene.
The show is broadcasting live inserts in all of this week's episodes, with a fully live episode on Friday to celebrate its 30th anniversary.
Aside from a fire breaking out in real life on Albert Square and Jake Wood mumbling viewers into a Abi Branning killed Lucy frenzy, things in Walford have gone pretty smoothly during EastEnders Live.
But ahead of Ian and Jane Beale's wedding, Jo's character Tanya was supposed to say "How's Ian?" but instead referred to Woodyatt and asked "How's Adam?"
The line resulted in Laurie Brett, who plays Jane, pulling an uncomfortable grin for a good three seconds live on BBC One.
After the episode, Jo Joyner acknowledged the slip-up, tweeting "at least you know it's live" "#gutted".
The identity of Lucy's killer will be revealed on Thursday night's double episode which are on BBC One at 19.30 and 21.25 GMT.
If you haven't already prepped the living room with snacks from the Minute Mart or booked a table at Beale's Plaice for the big reveal - here's a guide to planning a 'Who Killed Lucy' party.
