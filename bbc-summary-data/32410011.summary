A fire burning in a large pile of recycled wood in Bedfordshire "could last for days", the fire service said.

An estimated 500 tonnes of wood caught fire at ABC Demolitions in Mill Road, Colmworth at about 13:00 BST on Tuesday.
Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was now "under control" and it was letting the fire "burn down".
An investigation will take place when it has been extinguished, a spokesman said.
"Because of the nature of the fire and the size of the wood pile, it is likely this will be a protracted incident that could last for days," he said.
People in adjacent properties were evacuated.
The service could not confirm how many residents had been affected but said there were only a couple of properties next to the site.
Thermal imaging cameras are being used to ensure any radiant heat does not affect adjacent buildings.
