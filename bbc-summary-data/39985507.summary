Do you think you would work better in school if you could bring your pet along with you?

An office in Japan is encouraging the people that work there to bring their cats in with them each day.
The workers say the friendly felines make them feel less stressed, but there has been some issues.
The kitties have been walking on keyboards, knocking things over, and even turning off computers!
Less of the cat-titude, please.
Watch the video to see the cheeky felines making themselves at home.
