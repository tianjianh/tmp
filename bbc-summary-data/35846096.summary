Sion Bedwyr Evans, 41, of of Llanrug, and Garry Vaughan Roberts, 43, of Caernarfon, had faced 50 charges between them.
They were alleged to have happened at Canolfan Brynffynnon in Y Felinheli between September 2006 and March 2014.
The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges had been dropped after new information from the police.
