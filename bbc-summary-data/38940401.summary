[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 1-1 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth had Conor Chaplin's late strike to thank for earning a draw away against Barnet.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides looked out of sorts as passes repeatedly went astray in the opening exchanges.
Pompey eventually had the first effort on goal, Eoin Doyle heading wide from eight yards, while Curtis Weston met Mauro Vilhete's cross just after the half-hour mark to force David Forde into a sharp save at the other end.
Portsmouth boss Paul Cook brought on Chaplin and Danny Rose at the break but the Bees almost went ahead after an hour as Ruben Bover's free-kick clipped the side-netting.
The Spaniard had gone off when Barnet won another set-piece in a similar position but Vilhete deputised brilliantly, bending the ball over the wall to give the Bees an 82nd-minute lead.
However, the home side could not hang on as Chaplin fired a dramatic equaliser into the top corner from 20 yards in the 89th minute.
