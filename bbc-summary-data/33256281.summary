A gardener whose Lego versions of birds were turned into official kits by the toy company has turned his attentions to some of their larger cousins.

Thomas Poulsom, a former tree surgeon, is building a life-sized crane and flamingo for a nature centre's display.
They will form part of a "menagerie" at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust, Slimbridge, Gloucestershire.
The ten-creature collection, including a 4ft (1.2m) otter, is set to go on show next month.
His work will be displayed alongside animals made by certified Lego builders.
"It's very painstaking," Mr Poulsom said, "the flamingo took about two weeks to build - 10 days of working eight hours a day."
Since getting a box of bricks back from a friend a few years ago, Mr Poulsom, has created nearly 100 Lego birds in his two-bedroomed flat in Bristol.
But it was his first creation, a Robin called 'Bobby' that has remained his favourite.
"A Robin landed on my foot while I was digging and I thought I'd have a go at making one," he said.
"Once I started building it snowballed and now I don't want to stop making them."
In January, three of his detailed creations - a blue jay, hummingbird and robin - were commissioned by Lego.
Now he is hoping another three species of bird - the great spotted woodpecker, cardinal and common Kingfisher - will also became official kits.
"I can build anything out of Lego but I really enjoy birds," he said.
"But building something to look organic from bricks is not easy. It's very painstaking but once I get in the zone - I enjoy it."
The exhibition at Slimbridge will open on 18 July until 6 September.
