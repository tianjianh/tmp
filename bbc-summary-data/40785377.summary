Rory Gallagher resigns as Donegal senior football manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Gallagher has resigned as manager of Donegal's senior football panel - nine days after the county's crushing 15-point defeat by Galway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gallagher agreed a new three-year deal in 2016 but has opted to stand down in the wake of the 4-17 to 0-14 hammering in the All-Ireland qualifiers.
Fermanagh native Gallagher succeeded Jim McGuinness in 2014 having earlier served three years as his assistant.
Donegal were defeated by Tyrone in this year's Ulster semi-finals.
That put Gallagher's men into the second round of the qualifiers in which they saw off Longford, followed by a narrow 1-15 to 1-14 victory over Meath.
Donegal were then drawn to face Galway in Sligo and the manner of their defeat saw 38-year-old Gallagher come in for strong criticism.
The county board announced Gallagher's departure on social media on Monday night.
They thanked him for his efforts and said a full statement would follow.
