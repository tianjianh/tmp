A total of 179 cases of child sexual exploitation (CSE) are being investigated in Keighley and Bradford, West Yorkshire Police has said.

The cases involve 165 suspects and more than 100 victims.
A police spokesperson said many cases had "multiple suspects and multiple victims" but there was also a large number involving single suspects.
Last year, 12 men were jailed for their part in the abuse of a single victim in Keighley.
Eleven were jailed at Bradford Crown Court after being convicted of raping the girl from the age of 13 and another man was sentenced for sexual activity with her.
The CSE figures, which were given to the Keighley News and confirmed to the BBC by police, compare with last year's figure of 220 cases.
There were 261 suspects under investigation at the same time in 2016.
A police spokesperson said: "West Yorkshire Police and partners have been proactive in their approach to encourage victims to come forward and reassure them that all reports will be taken seriously.
"We have developed a far greater understanding of CSE than in the past and this has led to rapid action to prioritise resources to improve the identification and prosecution of perpetrators of this abhorrent crime."
