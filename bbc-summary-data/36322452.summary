1. A Pakistani lawyer and social activist is taking a stand against body shaming in her home country. Zainab Chughtai and a group of women recently shared their experiences in a video, which then went viral and was flooded with touching responses. BBC News met the young women in Lahore to discuss why they made this incredible, bold statement.
2. Despite her ongoing legal battle, Kesha says she's in a good place at last. In an open Instagram post, the singer told fans she's ready to reclaim her life and also revealed that she has been "battling depression and an eating disorder for a while." She also gave her critics a piece of her mind, saying: "If you wanna hate on my body, just remember that makes you look [stupid]." That's a statement we can get on board with, Kesha.
3. It's Mental Health Awareness Week and award-winning comedian Felicity Ward has shared five things about anxiety and depression that you probably didn't know (or did). Her piece in The Metro talks about the effects of mental illness such as losing both memory and control of your bladder, in her typically light hearted tone.
4. "Anxiety is nothing to brush off." YouTube star Louise Pentland, aka Sprinkle of Glitter, tells Glamour about her experience of one of the UK's most common mental health issues.

7. Four regular guys have recreated famous photos of male celebrities, including that Justin Bieber underwear ad and even an ode to Channing Tatum as Magic Mike. There's ab contouring and a lot of Photoshopping, so it turns out that effortless look is not so effortless. The video is part of BuzzFeed's Body Positivity Week and highlights how guys struggle with body image and have insecurities too.
