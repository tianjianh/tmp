Street lights will be switched off after midnight across parts of Dorset in a bid to save energy costs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dorset County Council said 20,000 lights would be switched off on residential streets in Corfe Mullen, West Moors, Ferndown and West Parley.
They will be switched back on at 05.30 GMT if it is still dark. The scheme will begin in December.
Lighting will be retained in high use and high crime areas, a council spokesman said.
