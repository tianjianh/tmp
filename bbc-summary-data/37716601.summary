Wycombe airfield pilot feared collision risk 'high'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pilot has told a "near miss" inquiry into an incident in Buckinghamshire involving a Robinson R22 helicopter he believed the collision risk was "high".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was doing training circuits with a student in a Cessna 152 at Wycombe Air Park, on 22 May, at the time.
The UK Airprox Board heard the helicopter pilot was "unfamiliar" with the airfield and air traffic control should have passed on more information.
Investigators concluded the helicopter "was not at the correct height".
Their report found the Cessna was travelling at 1,000ft (304m) when the pilot saw the helicopter "at the same height as his aircraft".
The helicopter ought to have been approaching the Buckinghamshire airfield at 750ft (228m) at the time.
Its pilot had already had to ask air traffic control to repeat the landing instructions four times before he heard them correctly.
The report concluded the aircraft's "close proximity meant safety was much reduced below the norm".
It also found a lack of specific instructions from air traffic control was a contributory factor to the incident.
