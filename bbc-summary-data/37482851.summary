The 39-year-old is in his second year as Saints boss after spending his entire playing career at the club before joining the coaching staff.
His side, who finished fourth, travel to Warrington in the Super League play-off semi-finals on Thursday.
"I don't get anxious, I wouldn't know what the emotion is," the former hooker told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"When I was a player I just used to get angry and that was to just so I could get out and play and have an influence on a game.
"Sometimes I was anxious last year, a little bit and worried about things - but this year I don't have any anxiety towards games."
The former Wales international added: "I'm a lot more relaxed with games and that's come with experience and that belief in the squad that they can go out and do a good job.
"I know as a club, me as a coach and my players are desperate to get out there on Thursday and it can't come quick enough."
