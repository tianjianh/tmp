Adam Blakeman scored the game's only goal in the first half, cutting inside from the left flank to hit a powerful shot into the bottom corner.
After the break, Josh Thompson almost doubled Southport's lead but Rhys Taylor saved his header from a corner.
Wrexham were left frustrated as the visitors stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to six games.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "That's the poorest we've been all season.
"From start to finish I thought we were very poor. What we produced wasn't good enough - everybody can see that, there's no point hiding.
"That's how you don't win football matches and we've got what we deserved and they got what they deserved."
