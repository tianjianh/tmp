[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains of Sgt David Harness Blakey, along with those of two others who have not been identified, were found in Thiepval in November 2013.
Sgt Blakey, from Gateshead, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, was 26 when he died on 1 July, 1916.
He was reburied, alongside the other two, at Connaught Cemetery in Thiepval.
The first day of the World War One battle was the bloodiest in the history of the British Army, with 20,000 men killed and 40,000 captured or wounded.
Following the discovery of the remains during a road-widening project, Sgt Blakey was identified via a home-made metal identity tag.
It is rare for fallen WWI soldiers to be identified from their tags, as they were commonly made from paper or compressed fibres, which rapidly decomposed.
Sgt Blakey is only the fifth in 10 years to be named using personal items.
The married father-of-three was born in Gateshead and became a miner before he enlisted in January 1915.
He rose to the rank of Sergeant and was serving with D Company, 11th Battalion, when he died, along with scores of others at the edge of Thiepval Wood.
In December 1916 he was awarded the Military Medal for "bravery in the field".
Following an appeal for family members, three generations of them attended the reburial.
Great-granddaughter Jackie Coleman said: "David's memory has been kept alive in our family since he went missing.
"This is a very special and fitting end to our search for him and one we will always treasure."
The two unknown soldiers, one from the Royal Irish Rifles and another from the Cambridgeshire Regiment, were also reburied.
