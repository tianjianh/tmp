Aird, 21, featured regularly for Rangers between 2012 and 2015 and was loaned to Vancouver Whitecaps last year. He has four international caps.
"I believe he can come in and excite the fans," manager Peter Houston told Falkirk's website.
"He's certainly a player with a bit of quality."
The Bairns visit Championship rivals Greenock Morton in Saturday's Scottish Cup fourth-round tie.
"Fraser is a player who I have been keen to bring to the club and one that we have worked hard to be able to secure," added Houston.
"He is versatile across the right-hand side of the pitch and is a player who can add something a bit different to what we already have."
Meanwhile, Rangers have confirmed that Tom Walsh, 20, has also terminated his contract at Ibrox.
The winger made his Rangers debut in 2012 and had loan spells at Stenhousemuir, Dumbarton and St Mirren.
"Everyone at the club wishes Fraser and Tom all the very best for their future careers," Rangers said in a statement.
