[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kris Leonard, River Reeves, and Jack Dakin - all aged 20 - Tomas Lowe, 27, and their manager Craig Tarry, 33, died outside Stockholm on 13 February.
The concert, which will feature friends and bands they have played with, will be hosted in their Warrington hometown by BBC Radio 1 DJ Phil Taggart.
Tickets are on sale for the show, at Parr Hall on 2 April.
Chris Persoglio, venue and events manager, said: "Having worked with Craig for many years and with the lads from the band on the Warrington Festival, we've been keen to hold a fitting tribute."
About 400 tickets have gone on sale and all proceeds will go to the families of the band members and their manager.
The bodies of the band and manager were released to their families on Thursday so funerals could take place.
It followed the adjournment of the inquests into their deaths, which was attended by 11 family members.
Cheshire Police said the band's car was travelling on a motorway and passed through a restricted area when it collided with barriers.
The car then fell into the canal below the bridge - about 18 miles from Stockholm - in Sodertalje, the inquest heard.
