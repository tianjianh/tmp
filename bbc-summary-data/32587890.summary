Fifteen tonnes of snow have been delivered to their enclosure at the zoo for the animals to enjoy.
Zookeepers say the bears like the snow and it puts them in a playful mood, triggering their natural instincts.
They're now hoping the weather in San Diego stays cool enough for it to last for a few days.
