Unemployment in Wales has risen slightly, according to latest labour market figures.

The Office for National Statistics data shows 67,000 people were unemployed in Wales between July and September - 3,000 more than the previous quarter.
But the figures also show 23,000 fewer unemployed in Wales than a year ago.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said Wales continued to outperform the rest of the UK in improvements in employment, unemployment and economic inactivity.
The unemployment rate is now 4.4% in Wales; the UK rate fell to 4.8%.
Only the south west, south east and east of England had lower rates of unemployment than Wales.
There are also now 38,000 more people employed in Wales than the same period in 2015.
Mr Jones added: "As a pro-business government, we are continuing to work hard to support the right economic conditions to help create and safeguard jobs right across Wales.
"Whatever happens in the world around us, we will continue to provide a strong, stable and secure environment for business and enterprise."
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns added: "A strengthening economy combined with the results of welfare reforms have translated into one of the brightest jobs market pictures we have seen for some time.
"We are seeing the strongest progress in areas like Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Blaenau Gwent; those parts of Wales which have traditionally suffered deep-rooted unemployment."
