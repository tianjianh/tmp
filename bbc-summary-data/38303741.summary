Numbers of young disabled footballers are on the rise

Typical shouts from football supporters - but the players on the pitch are helping to boost the disabled game in south Wales.
Monthly league meetings among disabled players in the region have expanded to include under-12 teams, with Cardiff City's pan-disability group recently joining teams from Rhondda Cynon Taff and Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan.
They are among young disabled players who now rank in the hundreds across Wales, with 30 teams taking part in sessions at club and regional level.
The South Wales Pan-Disability League is one of three across the country - the others are in south west Wales and north Wales - and caters to players with a range of disabilities including cerebral palsy, hearing loss and learning disabilities.
Players meet at venues across the region, most recently at Pontypridd's Maritime ground, for a monthly league in addition to their home club's weekly training sessions.
Rory, 12, a Manchester United fan who started attending Cardiff's under-12s pan-disability sessions this year, said he enjoys learning to pass, tackle and take penalties, although his favourite part is "playing matches at the end".
What does he think of the new league?
"It's good playing and I enjoy wearing the kit, but it should be [Cardiff's traditional] blue."
Like thousands of other young football lovers across Wales, Rory followed the national side's "fantastic" progress at Euro 2016 in the summer, the only disappointment being that they did not get through to the final.
Sessions like these can give disabled players the opportunity to develop in a similar way to mainstream players, with the chance of one day representing their country becoming a reality.
Rob Franklin, senior partnership manager at the Football Association of Wales, said there had always been under-16 and over-16 groups but they had started to see a need for the under-12 group too at regional level.
"There's lots of clubs developing under-12 age bands and it's great because there is that continuum through the club," he said.
"We have got two national impairment development squads at the moment, the learning disability under-19s and the deaf futsal.
"We have got four regional squads at coaching centres. There are three ability bands within each age range.
"With the top band, you potentially wouldn't know they are disabled. Then there's a middle band and a lower band, which is more about mobility and how mobile the player is."
Mr Franklin said pan-disability sessions were "seen as the entry point" into football and coaches were trained to try to make the sessions relevant for differing levels of ability.
"In an ideal world we'd have a disability specific team in one place. It's about the numbers sometimes."
Part of the FAW's push in recent years has been to run coach education courses dealing with disability.
"We have adapted that to go into schools too," he said.
"There are 50,000 children with special education needs and most of them are in mainstream schools, so it's helping teachers learn how to adapt a mainstream games lesson to include these children. No-one should be left on the side."
By 2020, the FAW aims to have a cerebral palsy national squad in place, which has been one of the two footballing disciplines to feature at the Paralympic Games in recent years, although at present it has been removed from the next games in Tokyo.
Players will be taken at about the age of 12 to help develop regional squads, with one base set to be established at Cardiff City FC Foundation.
Josh Law, disability and health coordinator at Cardiff City FC Foundation, said the club had been given funding by the FAW Trust, which manages disability football in Wales, to develop its cerebral palsy session.
He hoped this would help to attract more players and the set up of a disability development centre to support talented teenagers.
"The number of players with cerebral palsy attending the sessions has taken a bit of a slide in the last year or so," he said.
"However we are hoping, by having some consistency in the sessions, times and locations we can improve this.
"The opportunity for players to compete in the South Wales Pan Disability League is also an important part of the recruitment, retention and development of players."
