A new nature park has opened in Dorset to help protect wildlife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Holes Bay in Poole Harbour has special areas for birds and newly designated shellfish refuges.
The park is an initiative to bring together landowners, local communities and local businesses.
The Harbour Commissioners said: "It is important to work closely with local people in order to protect the natural environment for future generations."
The park also includes footpaths, cycle tracks, marinas and boat moorings.
The area attracts over-wintering birds such as avocets, black-tailed godwits, shelducks and wigeon.
Dorset Wildlife Trust said the mud found at Holes Bay supports over 80 species, including fish and the king rag worm.
Rare orchid species such as the marsh club rush and biting stonecrop also thrive there.
Poole Harbour Commissioners' Chief Executive Jim Stewart said: "This location is a stunning part of Poole Harbour and it is great to see a number of local organisations working together to make it more accessible for the public."
