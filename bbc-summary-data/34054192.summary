Police said Superman Rostas posed as a genuine customer and used distraction techniques to steal the watch from Andrew Michaels Jewellers in Newark.
It happened on 19 June but Nottinghamshire Police has now obtained CCTV footage of Mr Rostas.
The force has released a CCTV still in the hope it will help them trace him.
The 25-year-old is a Romanian national and has connections to Birmingham and the West Midlands.
The stolen watch was made by Chopard, a Swiss luxury brand.
PC Marc Taylor said: "The image of Rostas is very clear.
"We are appealing for anyone who has seen him or has any information on his whereabouts to get in touch."
