David Price: British heavyweight to fight Christian Hammer on Eubank Jr undercard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British heavyweight David Price will fight Germany-based Romanian Christian Hammer at London's Olympia next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fight on 4 February will be on the undercard of Chris Eubank Jr's latest bout, when he takes on Australian Renold Quinlan.
However the super-middleweight main event could be under threat, with Quinlan threatening to pull out.
Liverpool heavyweight Price, 33, will take on Hammer, 29, who has only four defeats in his 24-bout career.
One of those losses was a nine-round defeat to Tyson Fury in February 2015.
Hammer's most recent fight was a victory against Erkan Teper in October, the German who beat Price in 2015 before failing a drugs test.
Price has won two fights, each inside two rounds, since the defeat to Teper.
