[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 1-2 Cambridge United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge boss Shaun Derry won on his return to former club Notts County as the U's kept their slim hopes of making the League Two play-offs alive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Berry gave Cambridge a great start as he charged down County keeper Scott Loach's clearance and the ball flew into the far corner of the net.
County levelled when Haydn Hollis met a Liam Noble free-kick.
Ben Williamson got the winner after a goalmouth scramble before Noble was sent off for a foul on Darnell Furlong.
The victory leaves Cambridge five points off the play-off places with two games to go.
Derry's side must hope that they win their final two matches and AFC Wimbledon, who occupy the final play-off place, take no more than one point from their remaining three fixtures.
