Paul Trollope favourite to succeed Russell Slade at Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paul Trollope has emerged as strong favourite to succeed Russell Slade as Cardiff City boss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slade was removed as manager at the end of the season with the club now looking to appoint a head coach.
The 55-year-old has now taken up a new role as head of football at Cardiff and will oversee scouting among other duties.
Ex-Wales midfielder Trollope has been Cardiff head coach since February 2015 and is favourite with one bookmaker to take the managerial reigns.
Trollope, who spent five years as manager of Bristol Rovers, will be part of Chris Coleman's Wales coaching team at this summer's European Championship finals.
The 43-year-old was first-team coach at Birmingham City and Norwich City before joining Slade's backroom team midway through the 2014-15 season.
Slade was in charge for the final time when Cardiff drew 1-1 with Birmingham on the final day of the Championship season, a result which saw the Bluebirds finish eighth in the table.
Cardiff had targeted a place in the play-offs, but fell short as they recorded one win in their final seven matches.
Slade will be Cardiff's head of football next season, with a new head coach appointed to oversee the first-team.
