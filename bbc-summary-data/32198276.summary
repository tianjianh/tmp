Malky Mackay has been sacked as Wigan manager after 138 days in charge of the Championship strugglers.

The 43-year-old former Cardiff City boss, appointed on 19 November following the departure of Uwe Rosler, secured 19 points from a possible 72.
He was sacked following Monday's 2-0 home defeat by Derby County, a result that leaves the Latics eight points adrift of safety with five games left.
"This is a very difficult decision," said Wigan chairman David Sharpe.
"But I feel that for the long-term future of the club, there needs to be a change now."
Wigan's defeat by Derby means they have not won a home league game since 30 August, a run of 18 matches.
The club said no decision has been made regarding Mackay's replacement.
The Scot's appointment last November caused controversy as he was still being investigated by the Football Association after claims he sent texts of a homophobic, racist and sexist nature while at Cardiff.
Mackay admitted sending messages that were "disrespectful of other cultures" and the FA's investigation is ongoing.
Dave Whelan, then chairman of Wigan, was banned, fined and ordered to attend an FA education programme after making racist comments while defending Mackay's appointment.
Wigan were 22nd at the time and Mackay has failed to turn around their fortunes.
He gave no indication his departure was imminent as he spoke following the defeat by Derby.
"I thought we were terrific in the first half," he said.
"I thought we showed courage and we kept going, and we had four chances in their six-yard box.
"To not take one of them is criminal as far as we're concerned."
Mackay's sacking comes just a month after 23-year-old Sharpe replaced grandfather Whelan as chairman.
