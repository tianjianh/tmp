[SN]TITLE[SN]
Girls outperform boys in reading, latest Welsh data shows

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Girls have outperformed boys at reading although they did not fare better at maths, results of this year's school tests have shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pupils aged seven to 14 take national tests in April or May each year.
Monmouthshire's pupils got the best results in reading and the Vale of Glamorgan were the highest performers in numeracy tests.
Blaenau Gwent had the lowest results in reading and numeracy tests, according to Welsh Government data.
At all ages, girls outperformed boys at reading.
There are two numeracy tests - the procedural test which assesses skills in numbers, measuring and data while the other tests children on their reasoning, looking at ability to solve problems.
Boys performed better than girls in procedural tests but the gender difference varied at different ages in the reasoning test.
The gender gap was bigger in the Welsh reading test than in any other test.
The tests are meant to show where individual children might need more help and give schools information about how they compare with others.
There are two types of results - the age-standardised score gives information about how a child has done compared with other children of the same age.
The progress measure shows how well a child has done compared to every other child taking the test in his or her year group across Wales.
Anglesey's average progress measure had decreased the most in the English and Maths tests over the past three years, while Blaenau Gwent's score had fallen the most in the Welsh reading tests.
Swansea's increased the most in reading and the procedural maths test, Rhondda Cynon Taff in reasoning and Newport made most progress in Welsh reading tests.
The Welsh Government has been asked to comment on the results.
