Maria Macnamara, 45, from Livingston, founded "Smalls for All" after taking part in volunteer trips to orphanages in Brazil, Thailand and Ethiopia.
They provide underwear to orphanages, slums, camps, schools and hospitals.
They also fund the education of 31 children in Kenya and Uganda.
Ms Macnamara read about a priest in Zimbabwe who wrote about how a lack of underwear for communities can cause "serious problems".
Not only is it a health and hygiene issue, but the Smalls for All website says: "Women who can afford underwear tend to be seen as having someone who cares for them - a husband, brother or father. They are not on their own so they are not seen as vulnerable."
Ms Macnamara, originally from Edinburgh, is the latest recipient of a Point of Light award, which recognises outstanding individual volunteers - people who are making a change in their community and inspiring others.
Mr Cameron said: "Maria has identified a direct way to make a huge difference in the lives of women in developing countries.
"In just five years she has set up Smalls for All and gathered over 100,000 items of underwear to send to women across Africa.
"It may seem like a small action, but Maria's work will have had an immediate impact on the daily lives of thousands of women and I am delighted to recognise her service with this Points of Light award."
Ms Macnamara said: "I am absolutely delighted that the work that Smalls and our supporters has been doing has been recognised in this way.
"I started this charity because I wanted to make a difference. I didn't want a party or a fuss for my 40th birthday so instead I used the money to take a volunteering trip to Ethiopia. In the UK we take small things like underwear for granted but in Ethiopia I saw what a huge impact it can have.
"In the first few months of setting up Smalls for All, I collected over 10,000 pairs of pants and those receiving them were absolutely overwhelmed. All of a sudden, they can live normal lives again and go to school, go to church, be part of their community."
