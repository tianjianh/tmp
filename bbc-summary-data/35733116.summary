Port Vale mounted a stunning second-half fightback at London Road as they came from 2-0 down at half-time to beat Peterborough United.

Jon Taylor put Posh ahead after just 75 seconds before Aaron Williams fired in from the edge of the box on 41 minutes for his first Football League goal.
Byron Moore controlled Sam Foley's cut-back to pull one back on 49 minutes.
Vale then struck twice in the last four minutes as JJ Hooper glanced in before Louis Dodds rifled in the winner.
The striker's first goal in almost four months condemned Posh to a club record-equalling fifth successive home defeat.
Vale's third win in four games leaves them within three points of the League One play-off zone.
But victory came at a cost for Rob Page's side, who had defender Ryan Inniss stretchered off in the first half.
Port Vale manager Rob Page told Radio Stoke:
"We got off to the worst possible start, We gifted them a couple of goals.
"But credit has to go to the group of players. I couldn't be any more proud.
"We showed real character to come back into it and we thoroughly deserved to win."
