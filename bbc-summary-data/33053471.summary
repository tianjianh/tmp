UK tennis star Andy Murray has teamed up with crowdfunding firm Seedrs, to advise on businesses related to sport and wearable technology.

Crowdfunding is a way of raising money through lots of small investments from a large number of people, not necessarily professional investors.
Murray said he had "always been interested in investment" and that helping UK start-ups appealed to him.
He recently purchased the Cromlix Hotel near Dunblane, where he was born.
The two-time Grand Slam champion has committed to investing a "substantial amount" of his own money, as well as joining the advisory board, a spokesperson said, but details of how much he was putting in were not disclosed.
He has already invested in several Seedrs start-ups.
Seedrs chief executive and co-founder Jeff Lynn said: "We believe he can bring a different perspective into certain aspects of the early-stage business community in the health, sport and wearable technology spaces."
Murray is currently ranked number three in the world and has just reached the semi-finals at the French Open.
He is the reigning Olympics champion in singles, and has also won the US Open and Wimbledon titles.
