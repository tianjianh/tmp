Pembrokeshire schools consultation 'may be scrapped'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A consultation over reorganising two Pembrokeshire schools may be scrapped and restarted for a third time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillor Huw George confirmed an extraordinary meeting has been called for 26 November.
The BBC understands the consultation on Tasker Milward and Sir Thomas Picton schools in Haverfordwest may be stopped due to fears of a legal challenge.
The council's director for children and schools will offer to restart the consultation for both separately.
The charity that owns the Tasker Milward site had been unhappy with plans to merge the schools.
There were plans to open a new Welsh-medium comprehensive on the Sir Thomas Picton site.
