Morecambe manager Jim Bentley has said he will assess his future at the financially troubled League Two side at the end of the season.

The 40-year-old former Shrimps defender has been in charge since 2011 when he was initially player-manager.
Uncertainty over the ownership and wages being paid late three times are among the problems he has dealt with.
"The end product for me is getting to the end of the season and making sure we're a Football League club," he said.
Morecambe are 20th in League Two, 10 points above the relegation places, and Bentley will make no decisions about his future until they have completed their final six games.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "Then I'm going to assess everything myself because I can't have another year like I've had this year with the way that is has gone.
"Things need sorting and we've all got to move forward. It hasn't been right for the players and the staff, we've all got to pull together."
