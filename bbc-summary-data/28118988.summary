[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The crash involving a red car and a white pick-up style truck happened on the Sittingbourne-bound carriageway at about 13:15 BST.
The driver of the car, a 42-year-old woman from Sheerness and her son died in the crash, Kent Police said.
The pick-up truck driver has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
A six-year-old boy also in the car suffered minor injuries and was taken to a London hospital for treatment.
The bridge was closed in both directions for several hours, with traffic being diverted over the Kingsferry Bridge.
The Sheppey-bound carriageway has since reopened.
