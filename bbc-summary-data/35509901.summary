"Not good enough, simple as. I thought Northampton were fantastic. They showed us what it takes if you want to be getting out of this division.
"We matched them in the first half but they contained us. They made us look ordinary in the second half.
"If you want to hit the heights and try and get out this league that's where you've got to get to."
Northampton manager Chris Wilder told BBC Radio Northampton:

"There was nothing in the game in the first half, we had to endure a little bit of pressure - it was scrappy.
"We are there to be shot at and we understand that. Being top of the league, we have to handle that.
"Sometimes you need a little bit of magic to get you going. As soon as Rod produced a goal we were comfortable.
"We played like a side that really believes in themselves and drove the game forward."
