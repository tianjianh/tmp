It's textbook technique from Andy Carroll. There's a lot of instinct involved, but he knows what he's doing.
Is it better than Giroud's scorpion? There was an element of chance with Giroud but Carroll knows exactly what he's doing.
Former England defender Danny Mills on BBC Radio 5 live
Why shouldn't Diego Costa go to China? There is no loyalty from clubs in football.
He's already defected from Brazil, his native country, to play for Spain and has no real affinity with England and the Premier League. I'm sure he likes London but he doesn't have any real affinity here.
