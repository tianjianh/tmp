Nigel Davies: Head coach leaves Premiership club Ebbw Vale

Former Wales coach Nigel Davies has stepped down after two years as head coach of Welsh Premiership side Ebbw Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Davies, the ex-Scarlets and Gloucester director of rugby, succeeded Jason Strange in 2015.
He guided The Steelmen to victory over Pontypridd in the Premiership final a year later.

"I will always regard being part of this group and lifting the Premiership trophy as some of my fondest memories in the game."
