The departure of Bevington, who was appointed in March, comes a month after David Bernstein and Lord King resigned from the club's board.
Villa, who finished bottom of the Premier League, were relegated to the Championship in April.
Owner Randy Lerner has been seeking a buyer for the club since May 2014.
The club are also awaiting to appoint a new manager after the sacking of Remi Garde in March.
Bevington said he told chairman Steve Hollis that he would not be taking on a full-time role with the club.
"I know how hard Steve is working on a number of levels and I hope he can conclude the ownership and managerial positions very soon," Bevington said in a statement.
"There is a huge amount of work ahead for Aston Villa. A club of its size with its great support should be competing at the higher levels of the Premier League, not in the position it currently finds itself.
"To move forward, now more than ever, it is crucial the club makes the right calls on the big decisions it is faced with."
