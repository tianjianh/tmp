Swansea City midfielder Tom Carroll says he will find it strange trying to dent former club Tottenham's Premier League title hopes.

Carroll, 24, joined Swansea for Â£4.5m in January to end a 16 year association with Tottenham.
The Swans, one place and one point above the Premier League relegation zone, host Spurs on Wednesday evening.
"It will feel a bit strange for me playing them because I was there from the age of eight," Carroll said.
"Even though I have had loan spells, including here at Swansea, obviously you are not allowed to play against your parent club.
"But I am looking forward to it because it is such an important game.
"They are pushing for the title and we are fighting ourselves. Anything can happen at this time of year.
"We have seen a fair few times that the sides at the top of the table can be upset, and we will be looking to do that ourselves having done it against Liverpool."
Carroll made his Spurs debut at the age of 19, but he found it difficult to establish himself as a first-team regular.

Over half of his 25 starts came in the Europa League and he had various loan spells, including a successful stay at Swansea in the 2014-15 season, to gain first-team experience.
Carroll featured in exactly half of Tottenham's 38 Premier League games last season, albeit making only four starts for Mauricio Pochettino's side.
He has played all nine games since rejoining the Welsh club during the January transfer window a said he "loved it" at the Liberty Stadium.
"I am improving as a player every week and I have been happy with some of my performances," Carroll added.
"I realise there is a lot of improving to do, but it has been good.
"At the start of January we were rock bottom, so we have come a long way under the new gaffer.
"We have picked up a lot of points and we are looking forward to finishing the job."
