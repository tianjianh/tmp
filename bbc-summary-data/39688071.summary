It quickly turned into a survival battle at 57-4, but Aneurin Donald (66 not out) and Chris Cooke managed to dig in after Donald was dropped early.
The home side gave themselves a maximum of 57 overs to bowl Glamorgan out.
Leicestershire's declaration came on 360-6 after Mark Pettini had scored an unbeaten 110 - his first century at home for the county.
Batting on until 55 minutes after lunch looked to be a conservative option from stand-in Foxes captain Ned Eckersley, but Leicestershire kept alive real victory hopes into the chilly final session before shaking hands with eight overs remaining.
Donald curbed his natural attacking instincts in a mature performance, although he was dropped on 18.
Leicestershire were hindered by injury problems for Clint McKay, who only bowled three overs, and Ben Raine, who also left the field.
Leicestershire head coach Pierre de Bruyn told BBC Radio Leicester:
"It's been a tough four days for the bowlers especially, as we lost Zak Chappell for Glamorgan's first innings, and then Clint McKay and Ben Raine were only able to bowl a limited number of overs in the second innings.
"We believed around 60 overs would be enough to put them under pressure, especially if we could nip out the likes of Rudolph and Ingram early, which we did. But we missed a chance with the dropped catch, that could have changed everything."
"McKay and Raine will both have scans on Tuesday, back and side respectively, but Richard Jones and Dieter Klein are available , so there are options."
Glamorgan batsman Aneurin Donald told BBC Wales Sport:
"Chris [Cooke] and me took a while to get into it but ultimately we're really pleased with the way we played.
"Trying to spend time in the middle is key but also to get through a tough patch like we had is good for the confidence, I think something our dressing-room needed a little bit.
"We're pleased with how we dealt with it, all-in-all a worthwhile four days for both teams, and a high-scoring draw for both teams probably isn't the worst result."
