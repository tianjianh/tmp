A football team has played its first home game in more than 10 years after moving into a new stadium.

Scarborough Athletic FC played in its home town for the first time since the club was founded in 2007.
The team, formed after the collapse of Scarborough FC, has been playing home fixtures nearly 20 miles away in Bridlington.
The Sea Dogs lost 4-1 against Sheffield United XI in front of a sell-out 2,000 crowd at Flamingo Land Stadium.
Chairman Trevor Bull said: "Today is not only a great day for our club, it is also a massive day for our town."
The club was formed after Scarborough FC went out of business with debts of £2.5m. It is jointly owned by about 350 supporters.
Fan and club communications officer Will Baines said: "A lot of people have put a lot of work in to the club while we've been in exile, but now we're coming home."
Mr Baines said the move back to Scarborough was key to the future success of the side.
"We're fan-owned which means we've got our destiny in our own hands," he said.
"We've not got a big investor backing us, so that's why it's important that we're back in town as it's the money that we get through the turnstiles every week that will pay for the club."
The homecoming fixture generated such interest the council and club warned people not to congregate on the hill overlooking the ground as it has no public right of way.
The stadium forms part of a £50m development built on the town's former Weaponness Park and Ride site, which includes a swimming pool, new University Technical College and Coventry University's Scarborough campus.
Scarborough FC's former ground - the McCain Stadium -  was demolished in 2011.
