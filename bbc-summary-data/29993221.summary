Medics at Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan granted Sheila Marsh's last wish by arranging a visit from two of her horses outside the hospital.
The 77-year-old cancer patient died early on Tuesday.
Nurses said messages from around the world have helped her family.
The grandmother from Wigan, who used to work at Haydock Park Racecourse, had six horses, three dogs, three cats and other animals.
She "gently called" her favourite horse Bronwen, who then nuzzled her cheek while she lay in her bed, the hospital said.
Mrs Marsh's daughter Tina said she "thought the world of her animals".
Pauline Jones, nursing director at Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust said: "We've had such an emotional response from far and wide, from Australia and Hong Kong.
"The emails we've had have been amazing, it's been beyond anything we could have imagined."
