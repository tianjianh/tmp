His deal was set to expire at the end of the season.
The 31-year-old Brazilian has been with the club since a 2011 move from Genoa, and has made 186 appearances, scoring four times.
He said: "I have been here almost six years now. Bayern is like a second family to me and one of the best clubs in the world."
Earlier this week, Bayern striker Robert Lewandowski signed a contract extension until 2021.
