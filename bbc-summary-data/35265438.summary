[SN]TITLE[SN]
Johnston Press to cut up to 13 editorial jobs in Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The newspaper publisher Johnston Press is intending to cut up to 13 editorial jobs in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company owns the daily News Letter and a chain of local papers.
Staff have been told that the firm wants between eight and 13 voluntary editorial redundancies with other non-editorial jobs also under threat.
The Edinburgh-based firm owns more than 200 newspapers across the UK.
In an email to staff, the group's editor-in-chief said there will be job cuts across Johnston Press following "a challenging year".
A Johnston Press worker told the BBC the announcement was "a shocking start to the year for staff".
The worker said that staff had been told just weeks ago that there were no editorial job cuts in the pipe line.
In 2014, Johnston Press reported a pre-tax loss of £24m. Underlying profits, which excluded restructuring costs, rose from £54m to £56m.
The chief executive, Ashley Highfield, received pay of £1.65m, including a £645,000 bonus.
The company said it had no comment to make on the job losses.
