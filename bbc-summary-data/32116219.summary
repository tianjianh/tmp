Are British general elections stuck in the 1950s?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hustings, ballot boxes, election broadcasts, the leaders of two mighty parties battling it out for the "keys to Number 10". Why does so much about the general election seem to belong to a bygone era?

They didn't have Twitter feeds in the 1950s. Or rolling news. Or televised election debates. In fact, for much of the decade the BBC was banned from reporting from the campaign trail entirely. The party leaders would instead be invited to address the nation on radio and television in lengthy party election broadcasts.
Yet for many observers, British general elections have the feel of an historical re-enactment about them.
It is not just the draughty church halls and arcane terminology (why are public meetings called hustings? What do "returning officers" do between elections?)
It is the reliance on tried-and-tested campaigning methods - stuffing leaflets into envelopes, knocking on doors, filling in canvassing returns, touring the streets with a loud-hailer van, "getting the vote out" by driving recalcitrant supporters to the nearest polling station.
And, of course, the drama of election night itself - candidates anxiously pacing the hall as the ballot papers pile up on trestle tables, local dignitaries stepping up to the microphone in the early hours to announce the results.
For traditionalists, these rites and rituals are an almost mystical affirmation of British Parliamentary democracy.
Others wonder if the whole thing is a bit past its sell-by date.
"The voting system is incredibly romantic," Conservative MP Robert Halfon argued last year in a speech.
"We have the old-fashioned pencil and the beautiful, black, dented, old-fashioned ballot box.
"We mark a cross on a piece of paper and stick it in the ballot box, which is anachronistic and stuck in the previous century.
"The public have moved on from such behaviour, which is why we have seen such a drop in voter participation and a huge increase in people who want to vote by post."
Many election traditions stretch way back before the 1950s.
But it was that decade when the traditional way of doing things arguably reached its high-water mark.
The biggest general election turnout in British history - in percentage terms - came in 1950, with 83.9% of the electorate casting a ballot. That compares to 65.1% in 2010.
Of those who took part in the 1950 election, an astonishing 89.6% voted for one of the two big parties. The Labour Party clung on to power by just five seats, but would be ejected by the Conservatives the following year, when Winston Churchill won his only general election.
Watching footage of cheering election night crowds in Piccadilly Circus - or huddled around the wireless in smoky pubs - it is easy to think of the fifties as some kind of golden age for British democracy, when politics was at the very heart of national life.
Britain was a very different country back then. Wartime food rationing was still in force in the first part of the decade, with each person limited to 1oz of cheese, 2oz of tea, 2oz of jam spread, 4oz of bacon or ham and so on per week.
Television was in its infancy, men aged under 21 had to join the armed forces for two years of "national service", and luxuries like foreign holidays and cars were for the privileged few.
Change was coming, with the birth of rock and roll, the launch of commercial television and the growth of hire purchase heralding a less conformist, more consumerist, society - yet Britain was still a grey, austere country compared to today. And politics was different too.
However, strip away contemporary concerns about the future of the British Empire or the nationalisation of industry, and the election campaigns of the two big parties in the 1950s have a very familiar ring to them.
A recently rediscovered pamphlet from the 1950 election shows that Clement Attlee's Labour Party fought the campaign on a platform of protecting the NHS, increasing living standards and taxing the rich. There is also a promise to alleviate the housing crisis by building new "garden cities".
The 1950 Conservative manifesto accused Attlee's Labour government of wrecking the economy and being soft on welfare claimants.
The difference now is that the two biggest parties can no longer rely on vast voting blocs that divide neatly along class lines, as they could in the 1950s.
"Working class people, with a few exceptions, thought of themselves as Labour. Middle class people thought of themselves as Conservative," says Professor Paul Whiteley, of Essex University.
"Brand loyalty" in British politics began to decline in the 1960s, with the loosening up of rigid class barriers, says Prof Whitely, but he believes it has now reached a "tipping point".
"I think we are entering an era of very volatile politics, greater electoral volatility and greater volatility in the polls," he says.

The emergence of smaller parties, so vividly demonstrated by Thursday's seven-way TV election debate, has given voters more choice than ever.
It is a long way from the ultra-stable and predictable world of 1950s politics.
Yet the big two parties still have to present the election as a binary choice between their respective leaders.
If they fail to convince enough voters that this is the case then the next Parliament is likely to be "super-hung," says Prof Whiteley, "far more hung than it was in 2010" - and we could be looking at years of instability and weak minority governments. It might not even be possible to form a stable coalition.
One result, he argues, could be that demands for a change in the voting system might return with a vengeance.
"After the AV referendum, we all thought it had been called off for a generation but in the light of what is happening in this election I think it is going to arise again."
Others argue that it is the mechanics of voting itself that needs to change if Britain's creaking democracy is to receive a transfusion of new blood.
One of the biggest changes that has taken place since the 1950s has been the dramatic decline in young people voting in general elections.
Areeq Chowdhury, the 22-year-old chief executive of campaign group Webroots Democracy, says the very process of voting itself - trudging along to a local primary school or church hall to cast a ballot - is "alien to the way they live their lives".
"It is almost getting ridiculous, it is so outdated," he adds.
Webroots campaigns for the introduction of online voting, claiming in a report last month that it would increase turnout by nine million and save taxpayers Â£12m per general election.
The Speaker's Commission on Digital Democracy, whose members include Robert Halfon, have also backed the idea of online voting.
Traditionalists would argue that the British electoral system, for all its quirks and quaint rituals, has endured over the years for one simple reason: It works.
Putting a cross on a ballot paper might not be as exciting or convenient as touching an icon on a smart phone app, but it is relatively foolproof - and plenty of young people managed to do it in last year's Scottish referendum.
The two-party system might yet re-assert itself, as voters decide they prefer the stability of majority governments to the messy compromises of coalition.
And calls to bring the voting system into the 21st Century have so far fallen on deaf ears.
It looks like we might be reliving the 1950s at election time for a good while yet.
