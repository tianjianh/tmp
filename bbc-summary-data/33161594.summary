[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barts misinformed cancer patient about ovary removal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A breast cancer patient at Barts was wrongly told by the hospital her ovaries needed to be removed, a report has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seventeen of the 160 investigations in the report by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman were in Greater London.
The cases also included a man who had a tube put in incorrectly and later died.
Barts Health NHS Trust had not responded to comment when the story was published.
After treatment for breast cancer, the woman, referred to as Ms J, was told it was necessary to remove her ovaries because of a non-malignant mass.
She sought a second opinion which concluded their removal was not necessary.
The ombudsman said: "There was no clinical need for Ms J's ovaries to be removed."
It said the trust had agreed to put the doctors responsible through further training and had paid the woman Â£250. The report said the hospital also lost her records.
In another case, involving North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust, in north London, during winter 2011 a man referred to as Mr E was "incorrectly discharged" from hospital, after suffering pain in his knee, said the ombudsman.
He returned the next day to A&E where staff put a tube into his groin, it said.
Health workers did not realise for several hours they had put the tube in incorrectly and when they took it out, he suffered complications, according to the report. His condition deteriorated and he died in early 2012.
Mr E's daughter complained to the hospital. The ombudsman said it handled her complaint "poorly".
A spokesman for North Middlesex University Hospital said: "Since the ombudsman's report last year, we have written to the family apologising.
"We have also followed all of the ombudsman's recommendations on how to improve our complaints handling."
