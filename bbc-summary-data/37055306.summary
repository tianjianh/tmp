The Belfast man became the first Northern Ireland boxer to win world titles at two weight divisions when he defeated Leo Santa Cruz in the US.
Supporters gathered on the lawns at the front of Belfast City Hall on Friday evening to celebrate the win.
The Jackal said he was "glad to get home" after his win over the Mexican in New York last month.
"I haven't done a lot since I've come back home, I've tried to keep my head down," the 29-year-old added.
"This is the first time I've tried to get out among the people - to see the support they have for me is absolutely fantastic."
He said he hoped to fight again in December, with a potential rematch against Santa Cruz on the cards.
"I want to have Christmas off to spend time with Christine and the kids," he said.
"I'm ready to fight big names - I want all fights to be big fights.
"I want to fight in Belfast more often, more than I have been recently.
"But now I'm the champion again, we can bring the big boys to Belfast."
First Minister Arlene Foster, who was at City Hall, said Frampton is a "wonderful young man".
"We're all so proud of Carl Frampton, he embodies everything that is good about Northern Ireland, he inspires young people as well," she added.
Lord Mayor of Belfast Brian Kingston said the event was a chance for Frampton's fans to congratulate him.
"He is a tremendous ambassador for us," he said.
"Not just in what he has achieved, but how he handles himself, his whole character and he's very proud of where he comes from."
Frampton won his first world title - the IBF super-bantamweight crown - in 2014 when he beat Spain's Kiko Martinez.
He became the unified world champion at that weight when he defeated WBA champion Scott Quigg in February this year.
He then gave up his belts and moved up a weight to fight the previously undefeated Santa Cruz.
