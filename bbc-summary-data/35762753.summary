Wrexham FC to sign Racecourse stadium 99-year lease

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wrexham FC look set to sign a 99-year lease to regain control of the Racecourse stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glyndwr University bought the ground and fans group Wrexham Supporters' Trust took over the club when it got into difficulties in 2011.
The trust board said it was the right time to reacquire the stadium, subject to fans agreeing the deal at a meeting.
In a statement, the university said the move would allow the club to "thrive and grow, both on and off the pitch".
The deal does not include Colliers Park training ground.
The Centenary Club, next to the stadium, will continue as the students' bar.
