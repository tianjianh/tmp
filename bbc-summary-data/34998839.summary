Panini has announced the launch of its Wales sticker collection after Chris Coleman's side qualified for their first major tournament in 57 years.
The album went on sale on Thursday.
Ian Davis, of the Football Association of Wales, said: "The collection is a fantastic reflection of this historic campaign."
