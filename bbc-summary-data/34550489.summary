Kevin Brady has had to battle the cold and illness in his bid to conquer the River Severn, from its source in the Welsh mountains to the Severn Estuary.
Over the weekend, the 32-year-old reached his home city of Gloucester - some 50 miles (80km) from the finish.
He said: "I've still got a long way to go - there's still another four days of treacherous river to get through."
The adventurer began his 220 mile (350 km) marathon swim in Plynlimon, Powys on 23 September.
Since then, he has travelled through Shropshire, Worcestershire, and into Gloucestershire battling the cold and two days of illness after "swimming past a dead sheep".
"It's been really nice over the last few days seeing things that are familiar as opposed to being up in Wales and Shropshire and the support has just been growing and growing," he said.
"But the last four days are going to be some of the most dangerous in my life so I'm going to have to hope for the best."
So far he has raised over Â£8,000 for the Superhero Foundation, the charity which he co-founded with his cousin and fellow endurance athlete Jamie McDonald.
Next week, he is due to swim under both the Severn Bridge and the Second Severn Crossing and finish at Severn Beach near Bristol.
Last year he spent 140 days canoeing the length of the Mississippi River in the US from its source in Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico - a distance of more than 2,000 miles (3,200 km).
