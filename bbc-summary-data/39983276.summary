American Dirrell, 32, lost the title to Badou Jack in 2015.
Jack later relinquished the belt by moving up a weight division after being ordered to defend his title against Liverpool's Smith, 27.
"It's on. Callum Smith signs to fight for the WBC super-middleweight title v Anthony Dirrell," Joe Gallagher said.
In a post on social media, the trainer also said the fight would take place on 9 September in Los Angeles.
Smith, who last fought in December 2016, has won all 22 of his fights, 17 by knockout.
