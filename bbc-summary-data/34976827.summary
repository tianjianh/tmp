The yellow "be aware" warning for south, mid and north Wales lasts until Thursday and follows one issued earlier this week.
Flood warnings are in place for Lower Dee Valley from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadows and the River Wye in Monmouth.

Several flood alerts are also in place.
About 4cm-6cm (1.5in-2.3in) of rain is likely over high ground, with up to 10cm (3.9in) in Snowdonia, Gwynedd.
In Powys, the A490 near Welshpool remains closed due to flooding and the Dyfi Bridge in Machynlleth has been forced to close for the second time this week.
The areas covered by the warning are Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Powys, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Wrexham and Anglesey.
