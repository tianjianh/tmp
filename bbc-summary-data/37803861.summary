Svetlana ship detained in Cardiff over safety deficiencies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ship has been detained in Cardiff for nearly three weeks over a number of safety deficiencies found on board.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Maritime & Coastguard Agency (MCA) said the Maltese-registered Svetlana had been held since 12 October.
An MCA spokeswoman said the 11 deficiencies showed there was "clear evidence of a serious failure or lack of effective implementation of the safety management system on board".
Svetlana's owners have been asked to comment.
Port state control officers said the issues on the Svetlana all related to the international safety management code.
The MCA said these included a corroded main fire-fighting pipeline and a defective fire detection system for the cargo hold.
Upon re-inspection on 20 October, the MCA said crew members made complaints about non-payment of wages, so the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) was contacted.
ITF inspector Tommy Molloy said low wages were being paid to the Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian crew.
He added: "The MLC [Maritime Labour Convention] requires member states that have ratified to establish procedures for determining minimum wages for seafarers and that when doing so they should give consideration to those set by ILO [International Labour Organization].
"I have asked how low wages can be set before it becomes an issue for the Malta shipping register."
