American Chris Zablocki again finished second, while James Faudemer was the first Jersey runner home in a new personal best of 2:39.15.
Nollaigh O'Neill, who led from early on, dominated the women's race.
"I'm so happy, but the time was slow," said the 44-year-old Irish runner.
"I was flying up until about mile 20 or 21 and my quads started to seize and tighten up, so I just had to pull back and run strong and smart."
O'Neill made it over the line at the Weighbridge just outside the three hour mark (3:01.48) and more than 10 minutes clear of second-placed Ffion Davies.
More than 400 runners took on the full 26-mile course, with hundreds more in the 3K fun run and relay events.
While Troshkin stole the headlines in the men's race, Faudemer's run smashing quarter of an hour off his personal best was amongst the local highlights.
"I'm just so happy," Faudemer told BBC Radio Jersey.
"Long distance running is picking up in Jersey - I knew I had it in me with the sessions I've done in the build up.
"The support was amazing throughout the whole course, friends and family, it was awesome and made a big difference."
SportsHub Men, featuring Jersey's top triathlete Dan Halksworth, took the relay title while SportsHub Women were the first female team home.
Peter Holmes won the 3K race, narrowly ahead of Jack Kennedy.
