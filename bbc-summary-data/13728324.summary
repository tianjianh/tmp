Lesotho country profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Kingdom of Lesotho is made up mostly of highlands where many of the villages can be reached only on horseback, by foot or light aircraft.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resources are scarce - a consequence of the harsh environment of the highland plateau and limited agricultural space in the lowlands.
The former British protectorate has been heavily dependent on the country which completely surrounds it - South Africa.
Over the decades thousands of workers have been forced by the lack of job opportunities to find work at South African mines.
And the Lesotho Highlands Water Project was completed in the 1990s to export water to South Africa.

Head of state: King Letsie III
King Letsie III succeeded his father, King Moshoeshoe, who was dethroned in 1990.
Five years later, after the return to civilian government and amid political instability, he abdicated and his father was reinstated as monarch.
Letsie III was restored as king in 1996 after his father died in a car accident. The monarch has no legislative or executive powers.
Outgoing prime minister: Pakalitha Mosisili
Pakalitha Mosisili lost a vote of no-confidence in March 2017 which paved the way for early elections in June.
He headed a coalition government which unravelled after many members defected to the opposition.
He came to power in February 2015 following elections which were brought forward by nearly two years after the previous prime minister, Thomas Thabane, briefly fled to South Africa in August 2014, alleging a coup. South Africa was involved in mediating during the crisis.
Mr Mosisili's Democratic Congress (DC) ousted Mr Thabane's All Basotho Congress (ABC) by uniting with smaller parties, forming Lesotho's second consecutive coalition government after the election produced no clear winner.
Radio is the most-popular medium. As well as domestic outlets, South African radio and TV stations can be received.
