An anvil which was used to make the weather vanes on Buckingham Palace has been stolen from outside the home of a former blacksmith in Nottinghamshire.

Roy Green, 78, from Gotham, said he was "devastated" after it went missing on Monday.
Mr Green had also used the tool to build the gates to billionaire Adnan Khassoggi's mansion.
He said the anvil weighed about 300kg (661lbs) and would have taken "two strong men" to lift it.
The anvil was in Mr Green's front garden in Wodehouse Avenue.
"I couldn't believe it at the time," said Mr Green, who was a blacksmith for about 50 years.
"It was upsetting, [it is] more sentimental than anything."
His stepdaughter, Helen Harvey, said: "[We are] devastated. It's news you don't want just before Christmas.
"It's something that's been in the family for years and anybody who could take something that's got so many memories and emotions attached to it, it's really bad news."
Nottinghamshire Police have been making inquiries with local scrap merchants and anyone with any information has been asked to call 111.
