Jack Greene, Dwayne Cowan, Aikines-Aryeetey, Eilidh Doyle and Dan Bramble all won their individual events to take maximum points for Great Britain.
Aikines-Aryeetey led a British quartet to victory in the men's 4x100m final in a championship record of 38.08 seconds.
Germany lead on 166 points with Poland second with 150.50 and GB on 144.50.
Britain did not finish in the women's 4x100m relay after a failed final exchange.
Shannon Hylton, making her senior team debut, could not find the outstretched hand of Daryll Neita before the final leg.
CJ Ujah led off GB in the men's relay with Zharnel Hughes and Danny Talbot extending the team's lead before Aikines-Aryeetey powered down the home straight.
"Getting full points was the objective today," said Aikines-Aryeetey. "I ran 10.21 into a -0.7 wind, but equally I'm happy."
GB have fielded a developmental team with many of the big names opting to focus on qualifying for August's World Championships at the British Team Trials in Birmingham next weekend.
Greene secured GB's first win of the day taking first place in the men's 400m hurdles in a time of 49.47.
Cowan then followed up with victory in the 400m in a new personal best time of 45.46.
But the British athlete was only awarded first place after the Netherlands' Liemarvin Bonevacia was disqualified for a false start despite being allowed to run the race.
Aikines-Aryeetey claimed victory in the men's 100m final in 10.21 ahead of Germany's Julian Reus and Churandy Martina of the Netherlands.
Scotland's Doyle, who has struggled for form in this season's Diamond League, took a second off her season's best to win the 400m hurdles in 54.60.
"That's what I was looking for. No big stutters and putting together a technically much better race," she said.
"Even there it wasn't perfect but I think it was the best I could do in those conditions. I knew there was a sub-55 in there, it was just putting it all together."
And Bramble equalled his season best of 8.00m in the long jump to take first place and 11 points for GB.
Elsewhere, Rio 2016 Olympic bronze medallist and GB captain Sophie Hitchon finished fifth in the women's hammer throw final.
Jake Wightman (men's 1500m), Lennie Waite (women's 3,000m steeplechase) and Nick Goolab (men's men's 5,000m) all finished second.
Welshman David Omoregie is among the athletes competing on day two having qualified fastest for the 110m hurdles final.
Rio 2016 Olympians Morgan Lake and Jasmin Sawyers also compete in the high jump and long jump respectively.
