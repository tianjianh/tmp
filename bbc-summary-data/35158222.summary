John Concannon, 71, has dementia and hearing difficulties and went missing on Tuesday 10 November.
He was last seen getting off a bus in the Lenamore Road area of Derry, near the border with County Donegal.
Mr Concannon's son, Edward, said it would be the first Christmas the family has had without him.
He said his father went missing because he got on the wrong bus.
"It's a bus that he never took before and with dementia coming just all of a sudden, he didn't know where he was, he was confused and he didn't know where to go," Mr Concannon said.
"That's why we're currently finding it very hard to find him because he doesn't know where he is and we don't where he is and we're trying to get into the mind of a man who's not in his own mind."
Mr Concannon said his father looked distressed when last seen, with his hands on his head, because he is partially deaf and is "scared of being knocked down" by traffic.
"I just can't stand to think about that, your own father's going through a very scary time and we can do nothing to support him," he said.
"The weather when he went missing was the worst of the year - it was raining every day and he's anaemic, he feels the cold twice as much as we do.
"It's really tough, I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."
John Concannon is described as being 5ft 6in tall, of medium build and with grey hair.
He was wearing a black and grey beanie hat, a black coat, checked shirt and navy trousers when he went missing.
Ch Insp Alan Hutton said the PSNI and Garda (Irish police) have been working closely to try to find Mr Concannon and have carried out searches on land and waterways.
"We are also are very appreciative of the contributions of a civilian community search team that has assisted," he said.
"The information we have at this stage suggests a search area on and close to the border at Lenamore Road and across into Dundreen and Drumadooey.
"We will be renewing the searches and will be using specialist search facilities.
"In the meantime, our thoughts are with the Concannon family. They are going through a lot of uncertainty at a time of year when families like to be together."
