The polished defender advanced to beat keeper Alvin Rouse with a 25-yard right-foot shot to maintain the Blues' 100% league record.
Warren Feeney's men have won six out of six and are well clear of north Belfast clubs Crusaders and Cliftonville.
It was a fourth successive defeat for Ballinamallard who remain ninth.
"Sean has that in his locker and does it a lot in training. It was a fantastic finish.
"In the first half I was disappointed with how we moved the ball, but I knew we would get a chance.
"We were comfortable but did not do a lot to create things.
"I am pleased to come here and get the 1-0."
