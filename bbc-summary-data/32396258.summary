[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glasgow Prestwick Airport to install new security scanner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Prestwick Airport is to install new X-ray machines and a hi-tech security scanner at a cost of Â£250,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The device, known as a "body scanner", will replace the existing walk-through airport security metal detector.
It uses "millimetre wave technology" to scan passengers in order to detect prohibited items.
The Scottish government-owned airport said the device, which is being used by 250 airports worldwide, would be installed in the spring.
Prestwick Airport's security manager, Ian Gregory, said: "As part of our ongoing customer commitment, we've listened carefully to passengers' comments.
"They asked that the operation at our search facility remains fast, efficient, friendly and stress-free, and the new equipment will help us meet their aspirations.
He added: "The technology uses automatic threat recognition software which interprets the scan data instead of creating an image and identifies areas where items may be concealed on the body.
"These areas are flagged on a standardised stick-figure on a screen to indicate to the security officer areas of the individual's body which should be checked.
"As privacy and confidentiality are paramount, all data relating to the individual is destroyed after the scan is completed."
