Hundreds of people helped search for Andrew Green, who was last seen in June driving away from his family's farm in Chorley, near Bridgnorth in Shropshire.
The 33-year-old, who had been going through a relationship breakdown, was found on 10 March.
After his disappearance, his parents were "overwhelmed" by offers of help to bring in their harvest.
Edward and Julie Green said the gestures poured in via social media after they appealed for their son to come home last summer.

More than 100 people also helped search for Andrew in September.
An inquest into his death will be opened on 25 April, West Mercia Police said.
