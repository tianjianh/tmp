Former Aberdeen goalkeeper Jamie Langfield has joined St Mirren as a player-coach on a two-year deal.

The 35-year-old left Pittodrie this week after 10 years with the Dons.
"To come to my hometown club is that bit special," Langfield told the Paisley club's website.
"The gaffer made it clear that he wanted me to come in as a coach and use my experience but obviously I said I'm not just here to sit on the bench and make up the numbers and retire."
Langfield, who also played for Dundee and Partick Thistle, made 335 appearances for Aberdeen and was given a testimonial match last month.
"He's going to be a goalkeeper who will compete with Mark [Ridgers] for the jersey now and also the goalkeeping coach, which is great for us all because we needed someone in to help Mark predominantly in that role and someone who will push Mark for a starting position," said Buddies boss Ian Murray.
"Mark will realise that he needs to be pushed and it's always good to have other options.
"Mark's attitude in the whole process has been fantastic, we understand he's not had a lot of specialised goalkeeping coaching and that's what he needs.
"Jamie's at an age where he's maybe got one eye on the coaching role and certainly improving a younger goalkeeper in Mark as well. Hopefully they can work hand-in-hand together and help each other throughout the season and hopefully be behind a defence that doesn't concede many goals."
