The event will raise money for the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation - the cancer charity set up by the late Newcastle and England manager.
The huge personal haul of programmes, tickets, and books was gathered by Mr Alder over 40 years as he travelled around the world in support of his beloved Newcastle United.
