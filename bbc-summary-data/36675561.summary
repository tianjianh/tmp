[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Malawi has fired coach Ernest Mtawali and his assistant Nsanzurwimo Ramadahan, whose contracts were due to expire on 31 July.

It follows Malawi's early exit from the recent Cosafa Cup at the group stage.
Former midfielder Mtawali, 49, took over the national team in August 2015 but has paid for his record of six wins, six defeats and four draws.
Ramadahan will return as caretaker coach, however, to oversee Malawi's match against Swaziland in September.
The match, to be played on 3 September in Blantyre, is Malawi's last in their failed campaign to qualify for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.
Malawi's chances of making it to next year's finals in Gabon were ended in June when they were beaten by Zimbabwe in Harare. Malawi are bottom of Group L with only two points.
The Football Association of Malawi said Ramadahan would take charge of the team for a month from 10 August so Malawi can complete their fixtures.
On Saturday, FAM's technical sub-committee had recommended to the executive committee that Mtawali should be sacked and Ramadahan installed as caretaker coach.
It claimed Mtawali had been leading Malawi single-handedly and that he lacked the skills required to improve things at the national team.
The FAM technical sub-committee also recommended the appointment of an expatriate coach but the Malawi government stated it has no money for a foreign coach.
