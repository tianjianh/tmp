Election 2015: Wales promised £375m extra under Labour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tax rises will mean £375m extra a year for the Welsh government if Labour wins May's election, the party will say as it launches its Welsh manifesto.

Labour would bring back the 50p tax on incomes above £150,000 and introduce a "mansion tax" on homes worth over £2m.
But Plaid Cymru will challenge Labour politicians to drop what it calls their "commitment to Tory cuts".
Meanwhile, the Conservatives will say housing association tenants should gain the right to buy their homes in Wales.
David Cameron announced the policy for England when he launched the Tory UK manifesto on Tuesday.
The Welsh Conservatives will also highlight their opposition to plans by Labour ministers in Wales to scrap right to buy for people renting their council homes if Labour is in power after next year's assembly election.
The Welsh Liberal Democrats will warn that a "BLUKIP" alliance of "right wing Tories and UKIP" could hold the balance of power after polling day, urging voters to back Lib Dem candidates, to keep the next UK government "anchored in the centre ground".
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood will take part in a live televised debate in London involving five of Westminster's opposition party leaders.
Welsh Labour, which will launch its manifesto on Thursday morning in Llandudno, said it would guarantee a minimum overall level for the Welsh government budget - although there is no figure placed on this "floor".
The idea is to prevent the population-based formula for setting the budget from short-changing Wales.
Speaking before the event, Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said: "Increasing the minimum wage, scrapping abusive zero-hours contracts, taking on the energy companies are just a few of the practical, fully costed plans that will make a difference to working people in Wales.
"And I think people will also be pleased to hear that unlike the Tories, who have cut £1.5bn from the Welsh budget, Labour will deliver fair funding and a guaranteed funding floor."
With three weeks to go until polling day, Labour said it was confident Ed Miliband was on course to be the next prime minister.
The party currently holds 26 of Wales' 40 seats, and among its target seats are Conservative-held Cardiff North, Lib Dem-held Cardiff Central and Plaid Cymru-held Arfon.
