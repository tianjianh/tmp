[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to Pembury Crescent in Sidcup, south-east London, shortly after 16:00 BST on Friday to reports of an unresponsive man.
Officers found 82-year-old Arthur Walters-Girout, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
A post-mortem examination held on Sunday gave the cause of death as a head injury, police said.
Det Ch Insp Diane Tudway, of the Metropolitan Police, said the motive was still being investigated.
She has appealed for anyone who knew Mr Walters-Girout, or those living nearby, to contact police if they remembered any suspicious people or cars in the area in the days preceding his death.
She added: "My thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."
