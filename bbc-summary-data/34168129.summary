Leading charities say they will commit to a "strengthened" fundraising code to stop vulnerable donors being exploited.

Writing to the Sunday Times, 17 charity bosses said they would support the creation of a new regulator which could investigate and use "strong penalties" for any charity breaking the rules.
No-one should be "pressured into giving", the charity leaders wrote.
They are also expected to back an "opt-in" system, banning donors' details being passed on without permission.
The 17 chief executives represent charities including Cancer Research UK, Oxfam, the Royal British Legion and Save the Children.
They said British people were "incredibly generous", adding: "This generosity places a big responsibility on all UK charities to behave well in everything we do - especially in how we ask for support."
The letter continued: "We will commit to a strengthened Code of Fundraising Practice to guide how we contact people and ask for support.
"We will ensure at all times that we protect and safeguard those who might be vulnerable from undue pressure."
The Information Commissioner's Office is currently looking into claims that an 87-year-old man's personal details were sold or passed on by charities up to 200 times.
According to the Daily Mail, dementia sufferer Samuel Rae lost Â£35,000 after his information ended up with scammers. Information was passed to charities after he filled in a survey but omitted to tick a box stating that he did not want his personal details shared.
It is the latest in a series of cases where charities have allegedly contacted vulnerable people.
Richard Taylor, chief executive of the Institute of Fundraising, which organised the letter to the Sunday Times, said: "I don't know any fundraisers who wouldn't be shocked if they thought they've created anxiety and distress to members of the public.
"Where that's happened I want to apologise for that and say sorry, we have fallen below the expectations of the public."
He added: "Data selling shouldn't be buried in the small print and I expect that to be dealt with so you ban the size of text where it's so small it can be lost."
Tim Hunter, director of fundraising for Oxfam - which does not pass on donors' details - said the public outcry over aggressive fundraising practices had forced charities to act. People's generosity "needs to be backed up by trust," he added.
On Tuesday charity bosses will face questions from MPs over the use of call centres in fundraising.
Meanwhile Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, is leading a review into the self-regulation of charity fundraising.
