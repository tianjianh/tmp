Deysel, 32, has played four times for the Springboks and joins from the Sharks, having made 156 appearances for the Durban-based franchise.
The flanker joined Munster on a three-month loan deal this season and came off the bench in Saturday's Pro12 final defeat by Scarlets.
Ulster's operations director Bryn Cunningham said Deysel will "add real value both on and off the pitch".
Deysel was heavily involved in the latter stages of Munster's season having arrived as injury cover in March.
He came off the bench in Saturday's Pro12 final defeat by Scarlets as a replacement for Tommy O'Donnell after 45 minutes.
"We had a sizeable list of potential targets, even at this late stage of the season, but we believed Jean would be the best fit because his attributes are exactly what we need moving forward," stated Cunningham.
"He is one of the strongest ball carriers in South African rugby and he really relishes the physical side of the game.
"He is abrasive and confrontational, with the ball and without the ball, as we have witnessed first-hand for Munster."
Ulster have already signed South African prop Schalk van der Merwe while Marcell Coetzee should be fit at the start of next season after having surgery to repair torn cartilage in his knee in March.
Cunningham added: "The signs are good for a more robust and dominant forward pack next season."
