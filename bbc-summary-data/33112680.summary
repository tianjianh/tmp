[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eleanor Hawkins, 23, from Derbyshire, was among a group of 10 people who stripped before taking photographs at the peak of Mount Kinabalu on 30 May.
She admitted public indecency along with three other western tourists, one Dutch and two Canadians, and was imprisoned for three days.
All four have now left the island.
Noor Alam Khan Abdul Wahid Khan, the immigration department director of the Malaysian state Sabah, told the BBC Hawkins left Kota Kinabalu for Kuala Lumpur at 17:35 local time (10:35 BST) on Malaysia Airlines.
The other three, Dutch national Dylan Snel, 23, and Canadian siblings Lindsey, 23, and Danielle Peterson, 22, left earlier on Saturday for Kuala Lumpur.
Hawkins, whose sentence was back-dated to reflect time already served, was also fined 5,000 Malaysian ringgit (Â£860/$1,330) on Friday.
She and her co-accused all admitted a charge of "committing an obscene act in public".
Hawkins, who is from the Derbyshire village of Draycott, said she had been "stupid and disrespectful".
Prosecutors said the four tourists, along with six others, climbed the peak to enjoy the sunrise on 30 May and then challenged each other to take off their clothes and pose for photographs.
The move caused widespread offence in the region and was regarded as the cause of a magnitude 5.9 earthquake near the mountain, which is considered sacred.
The earthquake, on 5 June, killed 18 people, including children, and left hundreds more stranded.
Sabah state deputy chief minister Joseph Pairin Kitingan blamed it on the travellers showing "disrespect to the sacred mountain".
