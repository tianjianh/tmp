The Irish duo clinched a 22-20, 17-21, 21-12 win in Kolding.
Chloe Magee became the first Irish woman to win an Olympic Games match in 2008 in Beijing.
She also went on to compete at the 2012 and 2016 Games in London and Rio while Sam and another Magee brother Joshua won a men's doubles bronze medal at the inaugural 2015 European Games in Baku.
