[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Walmsley was sprung from custody by two armed men last month as he was getting into a cab with prison officers at Aintree University Hospital.
Officers detained the men on Friday after executing warrants at properties in Walton, Fazakerley and Manchester.
The men - aged 45, 64, and 42 - are being held suspicion of assisting an offender, Merseyside Police said.
There have been seven previous arrests in the search, including five men and a woman arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, and one man held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.
All have since been released pending further inquiries.
Walmsley is one of four men serving life sentences for the "vicious and savage" murder of Anthony Duffy in 2014.
Earlier this week, police offered Â£20,000 of Walmsley's own money - seized by officers following his conviction - as a reward for information leading to his capture.
Police are appealing for information but advised people not to approach Walmsley, who they describe as "highly dangerous".
