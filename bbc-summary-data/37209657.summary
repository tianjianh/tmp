[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain's Chris Froome slipped to fourth in the Vuelta a Espana standings as Spain's David de la Cruz won stage nine and took the leader's red jersey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Froome finished alongside his general classification rivals, two minutes 56 seconds behind De la Cruz.
The Spaniard is not expected to challenge in the overall standings but won the 164.5km stage by 27 seconds ahead of Belgian Dries Devenyns.
He overtakes Colombian Nairo Quintana, who took the red jersey on Saturday.
Froome is aiming to become the first man in 38 years to win the Vuelta and Tour de France in the same season.
He finished alongside Quintana and second-placed Alejandro Valverde, both of Movistar, as well as three-time champion Alberto Contador after they did not challenge De la Cruz for the stage win.
