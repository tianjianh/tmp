Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly confirms he had royal pardon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly has confirmed that he received the Royal Prerogative of Mercy after he was recaptured in the Netherlands in 1986.

He was speaking on Tuesday after the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee published its report on the controversial On the Runs scheme.
Mr Kelly escaped from the Maze Prison in 1983 while serving a jail sentence for the 1973 IRA Old Bailey bombing.
He told the BBC's Talkback he received the pardon, but not as an "On the Run".
The Royal Prerogative of Mercy, commonly known as a royal pardon, allows changes in sentences without the backing of or consultation with parliament.
Last year, Secretary of State Theresa Villiers disclosed that 365 royal pardons had been issued between 1979 and 2002.
It is not clear how many of those pardoned were members of paramilitary groups, or what proportion, if any, were members of the security forces.
The Northern Ireland Office has previously said the vast majority of pardons were not terrorism-related.
Asked by TUV leader Jim Allister if he had received a Royal Prerogative of Mercy, Mr Kelly said: "Actually I have - if you remember, and I presume you do, I was arrested in Holland, and the Dutch quashed all my sentences and the British agreed to that to get me back here, by the way, and yes, it was after an escape.
"But it wasn't a letter to do with On The Runs or to do with this scheme at all."
Mr Allister asked him: "From Her Majesty, the one against whom you were leading rebellion, you have a letter of Royal Prerogative of Mercy?"
Mr Kelly said: "The Dutch said they would not extradite me unless the British (government) quashed the sentences.
"Now it was up to the British (government) to quash the sentences whatever way they wanted to quash them - if they chose to produce a prerogative then that's their choice.
"I didn't care what way it was done -  the point was that I came back to Ireland as a remand prisoner as opposed to someone who was doing this length of sentence, because the Dutch came to the conclusion that it was unjust."
The On The Runs were republicans suspected of involvement in terrorist crimes but who had never been charged.
Under the scheme, letters were sent to more than 180 Irish republicans, telling them they were not wanted by police.
It came to light when one letter caused the collapse of the trial of a man accused of the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bomb.
