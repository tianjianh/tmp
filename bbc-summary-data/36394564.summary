Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fathy said it was a mark of respect to the victims and their families.
All 66 people on board Flight MS804 were killed when the plane crashed into the Mediterranean Sea.
A deep-water search to locate the wreckage and the plane's "black boxes" will start in the coming days, France's BEA air safety agency said.
The Airbus A320 was flying overnight from Paris to Cairo when it vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call.
Among those on board MS804 were 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.
They included a boy and two babies as well as seven crew and three security staff.
Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria.
Egypt's president has said that "all scenarios are possible", but Mr Fathy said last Friday that a terrorist attack was more likely than a technical failure.
Greece's defence minister said on Friday that, after leaving Greek airspace and before it disappeared from Greek radar, the plane abruptly turned 90 degrees left and then 360 degrees to the right, dropping from 11,300m (37,000 ft) to 4,600m (15,000ft) and then 3,000m (10,000ft).
The Aviation Herald also reported that the plane sent a series of warnings indicating that smoke had been detected on board three minutes before it disappeared.
The warnings do not indicate what might have caused the smoke.
