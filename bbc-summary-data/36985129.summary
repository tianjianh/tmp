James Don took covert photographs and video recordings of two women at various locations in Dundee.
The 60-year-old recorded footage in one of his victim's homes, including her bedroom, and repeatedly followed her.
A sheriff told Don his actions were "particularly horrifying".
Don was found guilty of three charges by a jury at Dundee Sheriff Court.
One of the women told the trial that she felt "terrified, violated and in shock" following the incident.
She said: "I can't believe somebody had been in my house.
"I don't feel safe, even now.
"The thought that he was in there, in my living room, in my bedroom, I just don't know how he got in."
Defence solicitor Ian Houston said: "He is hoping that the period of imprisonment won't be so long to end his marriage."
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC imposed a four-year extended sentence on Don, with three years to be served in jail and a year on licence.
He was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.
Sheriff Drummond said: "You went to the lengths of entering the privacy of one woman's home uninvited and videoed her bedroom and took photos of her underwear.
"That is particularly horrifying, that you invaded the sanctity of her home.
"It is clear to me that your behaviour has had a devastating impact on these women."
