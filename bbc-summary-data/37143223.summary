Clyde have agreed a new lease with their landlords that could lead to the Scottish League Two club scrapping plans to move from Broadwood Stadium.

The club say it gives them "the opportunity to remain at Broadwood for the next five years and with the chance to develop a permanent arrangement".
Clyde will continue to consider alternatives to the Cumbernauld venue.
But vice-chairman John Taylor said it was a chance "to develop a new and more productive relationship".
A site near Clyde's previous Shawfield home, between Dalmarnock and Rutherglen, is one of the potential locations for a new ground with remaining at Broadwood long-term another option.
"The new management team at NLL have shown a real commitment to the club over the last six months," Taylor told Clyde's website.
"Meanwhile, with the full knowledge of NLL, we continue to pursue opportunities at three other potential locations, all designed to achieve the club's objective of securing a sustainable business and community model to safeguard the club's future.
"Negotiations regarding the alignment of the club objectives with that of NLL are ongoing.
"These will remain confidential, but NLL understand that if a sustainable business and community model can be established at Broadwood then there would be no need to leave an excellent stadium, which can rightly claim to be a developing and vibrant sporting community hub."
The news was welcomed by Clyde team manager Barry Ferguson.
"From a playing perspective, we are delighted to be remaining here at Broadwood and using the excellent facilities the stadium offers," he said. "It's a great place to play our football."
Councillor Barry McCulloch, chair of North Lanarkshire Leisure, added: "Over the years, Broadwood has developed into a sporting hub of national significance, with tennis, BMX, gymnastics, rugby, martial arts, badminton and fitness all on offer.
"But football was where it all started and it remains a key part of the stadium's offering."
