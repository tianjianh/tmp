Mike Phenix had the best chance of a cagey first half, stabbing his effort wide for the home side.
Southport's Louis Almond and Forest Green's Jon Parkin had shots saved as both teams searched for an opener.
James Jennings' effort was spilled by Max Crocombe and Guthrie turned in the rebound 30 seconds into stoppage time for Rovers' fifth straight win.

The result saw Forest Green leapfrog Cheltenham into first place, while Southport remain 15th.
Forest Green boss Ady Pennock told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:
"It's great, it's a difficult place to come and Southport have done unbelievably well recently and it just shows the true character of us.
"With the Cheltenham result at Dover on Sunday, it was a great way to respond and I'm very proud of the players.
"We've got that never-say-die attitude and it really showed, it's another clean sheet which I'm very pleased with."
