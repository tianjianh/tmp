[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Hogan scored a brace as Brentford moved five points clear of the bottom three with victory over Burton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Championship's second-top scorer tucked home his first of the day after a defence-splitting pass from Romaine Sawyers.
Burton, without an away win this season, levelled when Jamie Ward finished Lucas Akins' pull-back.
But Hogan reacted first to a loose ball and rounded Jon McLaughlin to tap into an empty net and give the Bees victory.
Dean Smith's side had been on a four-game losing streak, but the three points lifted them up to 16th, while the Brewers dropped a place to 20th.
In addition to his two goals, Hogan also hit the post with a clever lob as the hosts tried to break the deadlock before half-time.
And, but for John Brayford's goalline clearance in injury time, Tom Field would have made it 3-1.
Burton's best chance to level for a second time came when Will Miller found space on the edge of the box, but he could not beat Dan Bentley in the home goal.
Brentford manager Dean Smith told BBC Radio London:
"We deserved to win the game behind the chances we created, we were a little sloppy on the ball in the second-half but the chances we've had we could have put the game to bed earlier than we did.
"They put a lot of balls into the box we had to defend but we defended them well.
"That's what [goalscorer] Scott Hogan does best, he could have had a few more as well."
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:
"It was an opportunity missed, second-half we were better, first-half ironically we went in 1-1 and were well in the game but we were more unlucky in the second-half.
"We didn't stop Brentford playing enough, we think sometimes we can come away and play our football but sometimes it's about stopping the opposition.
"When they've lost four games on the spin they're going to come out of the blocks."
