Outgoing president: Rosen Plevneliev
Rosen Plevneliev won the presidential elections in a run-off in October 2011, beating Socialist candidate Ivaylo Kalfin.
He took office in January 2012 for a five-year term in a post that carries few real powers.
His successor will be Rumen Radev - a Socialist and former air force commander who favours closer ties with Russia - following his victory in the presidential election of November 2016.
Outgoing prime Minister: Boyko Borisov
Boyko Borisov formed a centre-right coalition government made up of his centre-right Gerb party and the Reformist Bloc in November 2014, following snap elections the previous month.
The prime minister said his new government would work to guarantee stability, but warned that hard times lay ahead, highlighting economic stagnation, blocked EU funding, poverty and delayed reforms.
Voters grew impatient at Mr Borisov's lack of progress in fighting corruption and raising living standards, and he resigned in late 2016 in response to the Gerb candidate's defeat in presidential elections, triggering another early parliamentary election.
Mr Borisov was prime minister between 2009 and February 2013, when he stepped down during mass anti-poverty protests.
Global media giants have a stake in Bulgaria's lively broadcasting market. TV is the most popular medium.
International media group CME runs bTV, Bulgaria's most-watched channel. Scandinavian company MTG operates national station Nova TV.
There are several private regional TVs and many private radio stations. Cable and satellite are the main distribution platforms. Media ownership is concentrated among a handful of individuals.
