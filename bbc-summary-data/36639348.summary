[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives need a leader who can unite the country following the vote to leave the EU, Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb has said.

The Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, who might be a contender himself, said whoever takes over as prime minister must be someone who can talk to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
"This is a really serious moment for our country," he said.
"This isn't just about party unity now - it's about national unity."
David Cameron announced his resignation on Friday morning after leading the defeated campaign to remain in the EU.
Mr Crabb, the former Welsh Secretary who was also on the Remain side, said the new Tory leader must have a "plan for holding this United Kingdom together".
"What I want to see is a candidate emerge who understands the enormity of the situation we're in and who has got a clear plan to deliver on the expectations of the 17 million people who voted to come out last week," he said.
Meanwhile, junior Wales Office Minister Guto Bebb said he would not support Boris Johnson for leader.
The Aberconwy MP, who backed Remain, said that Mr Johnson had led a Leave campaign that was "unforgivably dishonest".
He told BBC Wales: "We need to have a discussion about the European Union but it's unfortunate that we've made a decision on promises that won't be fulfilled.
"We won't see extra investment in the NHS, we won't be saving Â£350m," he said, referring to the Leave camp's claims of the UK's annual cost of EU membership.
"Boris Johnson is not the man to lead us through this difficult time."
