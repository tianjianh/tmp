Meanwhile, Malaysia's former leader, Mahathir Mohamed, has called on Prime Minister Najib to show public proof that his assets are legal.
Speaking to the BBC's Jennifer Pak, Mr Mahathir accused the prime minister of having what he called a lavish lifestyle, which has been closely scrutinised in the local press.
Prime Minister Najib has previously issued a statement on social media site Facebook saying that the various allegations made against him are "unsubstantiated" and "outrageous".
