Alex Underhill, 25, was walking on the 6,000ft (1,829m) Jebel Jais mountain when he fell and hit his head.
Mr Underhill, originally from Fareham, Hampshire, but who lived in the UAE, had started to feel faint in temperatures peaking at 45C (113F).
His walking companion, George Crewe said Mr Underhill, a senior manager at Al Khayat Investment Group, would be "truly missed".
Mr Crewe posted on Facebook that the pair had been walking in the Ras Al Khaimah region and made the decision to turn back when they felt "very faint and exhausted in the heat.
He said he had been looking for shaded spots and, after a while, realised Mr Underhill was no longer behind him.
He found him lying unconscious and ran to get help but it had all been too late.
He described Mr Underhill as "everyone's favourite person".
A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with UAE authorities and providing support to the family of a British man who died in the UAE on 20 June.
