[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wife helped rapist Scott Rose prey on young girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A child rapist was helped by his wife to prey on a teenage girl, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Rose attacked the 14-year-old at his home in Dundee in July 2014.
Rose then teamed up with his 23-year-old wife Michelle to later target the same girl via Facebook and persuade her to send a nude photo of herself.
Rose, 29, was jailed for a total of 10 years at the High Court in Glasgow. His wife will be sentenced next month for indecent communications offences.
A jury heard how that after the rape, the teenager was bombarded with messages of a "sexual nature".
Rose had also groomed and abused a young boy for three years - starting when the child was nine.
He had earlier been convicted at a trial in Edinburgh of 10 charges including rape, using lewd and libidinous behaviour as well as pornography offences.
The court had heard he prevented the girl from leaving the house and pulled her onto a bed.
Lord Beckett told him he had been involved in crimes which were "grossly corrupt" and that he had "used his size and build" to rape the girl.
The judge added: "They (the children) were manipulated in order to fulfil your depraved intentions. You have no remorse for any of this."
Rose will be monitored for four years after his release from prison and has been placed on the sex offenders register for life.
Michelle Rose was convicted at the same trial of acting with her husband to communicate indecently with the girl who was attacked.
She remains on bail.
