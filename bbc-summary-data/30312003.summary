The X Factor judge was not the only winner from the talent show with 2012 finalist Ella Henderson picking up UK music artist.
The Saturdays, Abbey Clancy and Davina McCall all won prizes too at the event in central London.
The awards, hosted by Fearne Cotton, also celebrate real-life winners, chosen for outstanding achievements.
Ella Henderson said she was "very excited" to win the music award on the evening.
"To think this year has just been the year when my music has just begun to take off for me, so it's very exciting to be here," she told Newsbeat.
"I've been so crazy, especially over the last couple of months, travelling everywhere, so to come back here, get dressed up for the night. It's a really nice thing to sit down and enjoy."
Davina McCall was named ultimate editors choice for her mammoth Sport Relief challenge earlier this year, which raised more than Â£2m.
She spent seven days either running, swimming or cycling across the UK for the charity.
"I feel Grimmy was an enormous part of that, in fact Radio 1 helped me out a lot, just the support that I felt," she said at the awards.
Lena Dunham was named best writer for her book Not That Kind of Girl: A Young Woman Tells You What She's Learned.
Abbey Clancy won best style icon and Dame Vivienne Westwood picked up style icon and The Saturdays won ultimate fabulous friends.
"We're actually really honoured," Una Healy told Newsbeat.
"To win the fabulous friend award, means the world to us, we've won lots of awards in the past but never something for the actual reason I think we are still together."
The Script's Danny O'Donoghue was part of the judging panel for the real-life winners.
"I found it incredibly hard because there are so many amazing women, so many deserved winners," he said.
"I feel very humbled just to be on the same stage as them."
