Chat: What will you be doing this sunny weekend?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lots of places across the UK are set for some super sunny weather this weekend - what are you planning to do to make the most of it?

Will you be going to the beach or the park?
Or maybe staying in your garden to read a book, play a fun sport or have a picnic?
Perhaps you are going to see family or friends or chilling inside because it's too hot outdoors!
Whatever you're planning on doing this weekend, be sure to let us know!
You must ask your parent, teacher or guardian for permission before you send us a comment and a photo.
We may show your comment on our website or in our TV bulletins. We'll show your first name and which town you're from - but we won't use your details for anything else.
This weekend I am in Devon and I am going to go in the pool every day because the weather is so nice.
