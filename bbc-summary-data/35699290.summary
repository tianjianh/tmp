[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baptiste, 30, joined Boro last summer but has yet to make a competitive appearance after suffering a double leg fracture in a pre-season friendly.
The 30-year-old previously had spells at Mansfield Town and Blackburn and was a member of the Blackpool team that won promotion to the Premiership in 2008.
He will be available for Tuesday night's game against Burton Albion.
"Following an injury, he is now fit and raring to go and will make a valuable contribution in the remaining months of the season," Sheffield United manager Nigel Adkins told the club website.
