Police Scotland said a 25-year-old man was the victim of an unprovoked attack in Nox, in Justice Mill Lane, in the early hours of Sunday 8 May.
He suffered serious facial injuries.
The man police want to trace is described as in his mid-20s, about 6ft tall, of medium build, with short dark hair. He was wearing a long sleeved top with dark coloured sleeves, and jeans.
PC Paul Slatter said: "This was a vicious attack resulting in a male sustaining severe facial injuries.
"Assaults of this nature have a significant impact on the life of the victim.
"I would appeal to anyone who recognises the male pictured or has any knowledge of this incident to come forward and contact the police."
