Blackpool-born Croft captained the Red Rose for the majority of the season after Tom Smith was injured and led the team to their first T20 Blast title.
He hit five half-centuries in the T20 tournament and scored at an average of 41.61, including two hundreds, as Lancashire were promoted from Division Two of the County Championship.
"I want to help us win more trophies," the 31-year-old said.
"We want to be the first club to defend the T20 Blast and challenge back in the top division of the County Championship.
"It's a really exciting time to be part of this club and it's great to see the talent in the changing room, particularly with some of the younger guys signing new contracts as well."
The length of the new deal has not been disclosed and he becomes the fifth Lancashire player to sign a new contract this week, following Stephen Parry, Kyle Jarvis, Tom Bailey and Gavin Griffiths.
