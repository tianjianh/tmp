Masked men raided Akhtar Javeed's fast food and drink warehouse in the Digbeth area of Birmingham on 3 February.
West Midlands Police said they are treating the incident as a "targeted robbery attempt".
National Ballistics Intelligence Service experts said the weapon used wass not linked to another crime.
Officers now want to speak to a taxi driver who was seen in the area to help their inquiries.
Acting Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin said the vehicle, which is believed to be a private hire saloon car, was seen driving from Rea Street South to MacDonald Street at about 18:40 GMT.
"It happened at a time when other people may have been leaving work for the day and someone may have seen what happened or have important information about the suspects," he said.
Assad Shan, who lived opposite Mr Javeed in East Ham, London, said he was shocked by what had happened to his friend.
"[He] was like the most innocent soul that I personally knew," he said.
"I think it's probably one of the worst things to happen to our area."
