[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gary Barlow is only caller allowed by mum of sleeping twins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother has caused a stir on social media because of a sign on her door saying she would only open it to Gary Barlow because of her sleeping twins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Natasha Butler, from Norfolk, said she often put up a warning sign because of the "small window of opportunity for them to sleep and me to work".
A number of mothers on The Unmumsy Mum Facebook page have praised her idea, but she also received abuse.
She said she would "die on the spot" if the Take That singer did turn up.
The note reads that you should only knock if "A - you're Gary Barlow, B - I've won on the premium bonds, C - someone I know has died".
Ms Butler, 37, from Drayton near Norwich, said: "I work from home on Tuesdays and the twins had been to pre-school in the morning.
"They were tired and I have to pick my five-year-old up from school at three, so at one I had a small window of opportunity for them to sleep and me to work.
"I always put a sign up. The words vary but on Tuesday I thought 'who wouldn't I mind interrupting us?'"
The sign has gained more than 40,000 "likes" on Facebook and received hundreds of praise from other mothers.
But she said after the story was shared on Mail Online she had received abuse, including some people calling her an "attention seeker" and criticising her for "lazy parenting".
"I'm wishing I'd never sent it in now," she said.
"It's all tongue-in-cheek. I'd die on the spot if Gary Barlow knocked on my door."
The singer has been contacted for comment.
