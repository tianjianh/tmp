Police said 301 people were held over the two-day event, 23 more than the 278 arrested in 2012.
Most of those arrested were held for drug and public order offences, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said.
More than 300 people were treated for cuts, bruises and alcohol-related injuries, according to the London Ambulance Service.
About one million people attended the two-day event in west London.
A Met Police spokesman said 6,000 officers were on duty at the carnival on Sunday and just under 7,000 on Bank Holiday Monday.
