The 19-year-old becomes the 10th player to join Falcons for the 2016-17 season and along with fellow new signings Nick Civetta, Evan Ormstead and Harrison Orr offers depth to the second-row options.
"He is a major talent," Falcons director of rugby Dean Richards said of the Glasgow Hawks player.
"He has a lot to offer and we are extremely happy he has agreed to join."
Davidson, who can also play back-row, attended Falcons' game with London Irish before signing with the club and has been impressed by what he has seen.
"I love the attitude of the club and its supporters - the atmosphere inside the ground was tremendous," he said.
"To play in front of that would be an honour, but I know I have to earn my place through hard work and showing to the coaches that I am worthy of selection."
