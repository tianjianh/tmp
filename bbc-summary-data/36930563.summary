[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ross County 1-3 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Loy's double and a Paul McGowan strike on the counter sealed an impressive opening day win for Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Loy capitalised on Mark O'Hara's surging run and cross to fire home early on before confidently netting a penalty after O'Hara was held back.
McGowan coolly converted a perfectly weighted pass from Michael Duffy as Dundee broke on the counter attack.
Substitute Craig Curran offered some hope when he tapped Liam Boyce's shot home but a comeback never materialised.
Dundee's team news sparked some interest with Greg Stewart out of the squad altogether.
However, when asked if a transfer may be in the offing, Dundee manager Paul Hartley confirmed an ankle injury had kept him out and that he would likely be fit for next weekend.

Loy took the opportunity to start, with Kane Hemmings now at Oxford United and new signing Faissal El Bakhtaoui on the bench.
The game may have been very different had Brian Graham taken advantage from close range but his miss-hit shot was eventually cleared when he ought to have found the net.
Loy looked sharp and took his opportunity with a fine close-range finish and a well-executed penalty putting Dundee on course for the win.
Referee Bobby Madden had warned players in the box moments before judging Jay McEveley to have impeded O'Hara, a decision consistent with others he has awarded already this season.
County pressed in the second half without overly penetrating and played right into Dundee's hands when Duffy surged away, squared for McGowan and goalkeeper Scott Fox's touch couldn't prevent the ball squirming over the line.
Dundee's Scott Bain saved superbly from Michael Gardyne before Curran's touch gave County hope but, despite pushing Dundee back, they lacked the cutting edge to alter the result.
County's disappointing start to the season continues.
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "A terrific team performance and the work ethic of the team was terrific.
"Rory (Loy) started last season in the exact same fashion then picked up an injury then with Kano's (Kane Hemmings') form it was difficult for Rory to get back in. He's going to be given the opportunity."
"(Greg Stewart) got injured in training on Thursday, we thought he might be okay but we're looking hopefully at him being back Monday or Tuesday.
"He's priceless. A player of that ability. He's got a year left on his contract. I want to keep Greg Stewart but it's going to be difficult."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "If we're going to give penalties for that (Jay McEvely for holding) then we're going to have a lot of penalties.
"Jay's got his hand on him but if the consistency is going to be there then we're going to be seeing a lot for that.
"If he's got a grip of his shirt and the ref spots that then you just need to suck it up.
"We're all fully aware of the rules but you see that type of thing going on in the box all the time and you don't see it punished that often.
"If there's going to be a consistency there then I've not got a problem with that."
