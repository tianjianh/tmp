The 35-year-old made his 98th Warriors appearance as a second-half replacement in Saturday's 14-7 loss at Connacht.
Capped 104 times for Scotland, Lamont left Glasgow in 2005 before returning in 2012 and has scored 27 tries over his two spells at the Pro12 champions.
"I feel I've still got more to give and I'm enjoying being part of a winning team," he said.
"I want to keep on playing and I'm glad I get to extend my time at a club which I really enjoy representing."
Lamont was not selected for Scotland's summer tour to Japan.
The winger featured in three Six Nations matches this year, starting against Wales and coming off the bench twice.
