"Anger", "outrage", "betrayal" and "shame" are just some of the strong words the Indian media are using in connection with the arrest of Rajasthan Royals players S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan and Ajit Chandila.
Sreesanth was part of the national team that won the Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 and the one-day international World Cup in 2011.
The cricketers' families have already protested that they are innocent and media reports on Friday quote Sreesanth's lawyer as saying that he is "totally innocent".
The Times of India says that "the dark and ugly face of Indian cricket exposed itself on Thursday".
"Sreesanth puts IPL in a spot, fans in a fix," is the headline of The Hindu newspaper.
"A major clean-up operation is required if cricket in India is to retain the loyalty of its fans," the paper's editorial says.
The Hindustan Times says:  "Indian cricket's reputation was dragged through the mud on Thursday and a billion fans were betrayed".
Prominent Hindi newspaper Dainik Jagran says the allegations have cast serious doubts over the credibility of cricket in India and that fans will now keenly watch players' actions.
Punjab's leading daily The Tribune writes: "It is a sad day when the uncertainties inherent in sport are undermined by the lure of money."
The Statesman quotes former India captain Sunil Gavaskar: "I am completely shocked. The IPL rewards cricketers quite handsomely, some of them are paid over-handsomely".
In other news, the Supreme Court has asked state governments to be careful in arresting people for posting "objectionable comments" on social networking sites, The New Indian Express reports.
"The courts said that state governments should ensure strict compliance of the federal government's advisory, which said that a person should not be arrested without taking permission from senior police officials," the paper adds.
It goes on to state that the court's advice should be seen "in view of public outrage over people being arrested for making comments or liking posts on Facebook".
Bollywood stars Sanjay Dutt's return to jail for firearms offences linked to the 1993 Mumbai blasts has also been covered extensively in the media.
A picture gallery in The Indian Express shows Dutt's journey from his house to the prison.
Though overshadowed by Dutt's return to jail, Bollywood's tryst with glamour continues and most Indian newspapers and websites are enthusiastically reporting India's presence at the Cannes Film Festival.
The Indian Express shows Bollywood "shining" in a picture gallery with photos of superstar Amitabh Bachchan, Sonam Kapoor and Vidya Balan walking the red carpet.
The Hindustan Times praised Mr Bachchan for addressing the festival audience in Hindi.
"It was a historic moment for Amitabh Bachchan to be invited to open the prestigious Cannes International Film Festival with his The Great Gatsby co-star Leonardo DiCaprio. Big B made the experience more special by addressing the audience in his mother tongue Hindi," the paper said.
