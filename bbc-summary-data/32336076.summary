[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hung Parliament game rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The hung Parliament game does not aim to predict the result of the election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new result is generated at random every time you click the 'Get a result' button and every player receives a different result every time they play.
The results within the game are limited to return a hung parliament and each represents just one of thousands of possibilities.
