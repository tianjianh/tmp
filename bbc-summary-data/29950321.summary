Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Wolverhampton and Dudley authorities have announced plans for a new alliance, which will serve 3.4 million people.
Sandwell Council leader Darren Cooper said he was trying to persuade Solihull and Coventry authorities to join the "super council" for the Midlands.
Speaking about the proposals, he said the plan was to create "a tier over the separate councils with a link to government" with "no extra cost and no extra politicians".
