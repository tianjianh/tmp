Boundary changes: Political map of Scotland to be redrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The political map of Scotland is to be almost completely redrawn under plans to cut the number of Scottish seats at Westminster from 59 to 53.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposals would see changes to the boundaries of all but three of the existing constituencies.
And they could threaten the seats of the only Labour and Conservative MPs in Scotland.
The move forms part of proposals to reduce the total number of MPs in the House of Commons from 650 to 600.
But the proposed boundary changes have been described as "unacceptable" by Labour and the SNP - which won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland at the last general election.
The plans, which will now go out to public consultation, have been unveiled by the Boundary Commission for Scotland and follow similar reviews in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
They would see the East Lothian constituency remain untouched, as would the island seats of Orkney and Shetland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles) - both of which are protected by law.
A further 16 seats would have their names retained despite their boundaries changing to some extent.
But elsewhere, 40 sitting MPs will be facing a scramble for only 34 new seats.
Among the proposals are:
The Boundary Commission for Scotland was required to ensure each of the new constituencies - with the exception of the island seats - has between 71,031 and 78,507 voters and does not cover an area of more than 13,000 sq km (5,019 sq miles).
Only 11 of the existing constituencies, not including the two protected seats, have the required number of voters, while five are above it and the remaining 41 are below.
Lord Matthews, deputy chairman of the commission, said he believed the proposals were a "good implementation" of the rules set by parliament.
He added: "Today is the start of a process, and we now want to hear the views of the public. We will reflect on responses to the consultation and makes changes if needed where the legislation allows us to do so.
"We will be running a number of public events across the country in the coming weeks and hope that voters will make their views heard."
The SNP's new deputy leader, Angus Robertson, criticised the proposed reduction in the number of elected representatives in Scotland.
He said: "At a time when Scotland already faces a deep and growing democratic deficit, with a Tory government that we didn't vote for imposing increasingly right-wing policies against our will, it is vital that the Scottish people have strong elected representation at Westminster to stand up for Scotland's interests and to hold the UK government to account."
Scottish Labour also criticised the new boundaries, with its sole MP Ian Murray - whose Edinburgh South constituency has effectively been split into two new seats - claiming they were "unfair, undemocratic and unacceptable".
He added: "They are based on an out-of-date version of the electoral register with nearly two million voters across the UK missing."
On average, an existing constituency has about 66,000 electors and an area of 1,360 sq km, while the proposed new constituencies have, on average, about 73,500 electors and an area of 1,514 sq km.
Almost two thirds of proposed constituencies are each within a single council area, with no constituencies containing parts of more than two council areas.
The largest proposed constituency by area is Highland North, at 12,985 sq km, while the smallest would be Edinburgh North and Leith, at 20 sq km.
And the new constituency with the most electors would be Moray and Nairn at 78,477, while Clackmannanshire and Stirling North would have the fewest at 71,122.
The real battle in the next general election might take place before the actual vote. Some SNP MPs will have to fight each other for the nomination as a constituency candidate - while Labour and the Conservatives risk humiliation.
Prof John Curtice has said there will be a "substantial game of musical chairs played across the country".
Glasgow will be the most interesting battleground, going from seven to six MPs. Patrick Grady, Carol Monaghan and Alison Thewliss will be most affected.
Roger Mullin in Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath is being utterly squeezed while, across the Forth, Labour's Ian Murray seems incredulous at the changes in Edinburgh South.
He has probably got a good personal vote but key parts of his constituency are going.
If we swing down to the south-west, David Mundell is at risk too. Scotland's only Conservative MP is seeing his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat being abolished and the new seat taking in healthy SNP chunks.
The scale of revision is huge - and there are massive constituencies. From the Cuillins to the Cairngorms, the size of the new Inverness and Skye seat makes the mind boggle.
It could be difficult here for SNP MPs again, as the the region's going from three seats to two.
The consultation on the proposals will run until 11 January 2017. Members of the public and interested parties can get further information and submit views on the commission's interactive portal. A number of public events will also be held around the country.
The changes will also see the number of seats in England reduced from 533 to 501; in Wales from 40 to 29; and in Northern Ireland from 18 to 17.
The Boundary Commissions for England, Northern Ireland and Wales launched their own consultations on the proposals last month.
