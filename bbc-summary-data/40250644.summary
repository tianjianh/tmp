A senior Plaid Cymru policy adviser has said the party should consider co-operating with the Tories on particular topics if "we get something in return".

Dr Eurfyl ap Gwilym said Plaid would not offer its support in general but "only on special things".
The Conservatives are seeking a deal with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionists after losing their majority.
A Plaid spokeswoman said it would always "vote in the best interests of Wales" but not strike a formal deal.
Speaking on BBC Radio Cymru, Dr ap Gwilym was asked whether Plaid Cymru would co-operate with the Conservatives.
"No, no, not in general but if they said 'we want to do this or that' and it's ok with us and we got something in return, for example more investment in infrastructure, then we'd be prepared to consider it," he said.
"Of course, we wouldn't give them support in general but only on special things," he added.
During the general election campaign, Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood promised to "defend Wales against the Tory attacks".
She has previously ruled out working with the Conservative group in the assembly.
A party spokeswoman said: "Plaid Cymru MPs will, as they always have, vote in the best interests of Wales, but we won't be entering into any deals or coalitions with the Tories."
