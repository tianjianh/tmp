Transport for London 'should control trains', report says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Poor" train services in London should be moved from central to local government control, a report by City Hall has claimed.

The London Assembly's inquiry singled out suburban routes south of the River Thames as a priority for devolution.
It claims Transport for London (TfL) and the mayor could commission services more efficiently.
But the Rail Delivery Group said the current system produces some of "the best passenger satisfaction levels".
The report found: "Passengers' experience of the rail network in London is often poor, and appears to be getting worse."
It cited Department for Transport figures for 2014 showing 40% of morning peak services arrived in London over-capacity, and 16% of London and South East rail services arrived at least five minutes late.
The key recommendation was that TfL should replace the Department for Transport as the commissioning authority for suburban rail routes in London, saying it has "demonstrated its ability to carry out this role already with the London Overground network".
Valerie Shawcross, Labour chair of the Assembly's Transport Committee, said: "There is a growing consensus that rail devolution to London is a good idea, including among passengers both inside and outside of London."
The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operating companies and network rail, said: "Some of the best rail passenger satisfaction levels in London and the South East are being achieved on services commissioned by both Transport for London and the Department for Transport.
"Private train companies already work effectively with TfL, whether by operating London Overground or ensuring that passengers can use their tickets to travel across both TfL and national rail."
The RDG added the decision as to which body commissions train services in the capital was one for the government.
The Assembly report acknowledged "significant challenges" in persuading the government of the case for reform.
