Gardner came through Villa's academy system and has since made 33 appearances for the club.
The 24-year-old has been on loan with five other teams, including a six-month loan spell in the second tier with Nottingham Forest last season.
Aston Villa are 13th in the Championship table, six points outside the play-off places.
Meanwhile, defender Easah Suliman has signed a new deal to stay at Villa Park until 2019.
The 18-year-old has yet to make his Villa debut, but has played in 12 games on loan at League Two side Cheltenham this season.
