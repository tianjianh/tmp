Could Big Ben be replaced by Little John?

Big Ben could be substituted by Little John should the landmark Westminster clock fall silent.

A recent report said the Great Clock needed urgent repairs costing Â£40m which, if not carried out, will cause "international reputational damage".
Now, Nottingham City Council has offered 10-tonne bell Little John as a bongs replacement on BBC Radio 4.
It is one part of "the best set of clock bells" in the country, says David Lyon who maintains them.
The famous chimes of the Great Clock, on the Houses of Parliament, signal the end of PM and the start of the news on Radio 4, at 18:00.
News that Big Ben may be silenced, prompted an offer from Nottingham council that the BBC could broadcast the live chimes from its Council House while London's set is repaired.
Deputy leader Graham Chapman admitted it was a tongue-in-cheek "gimmick" but it was "the only possible alternative for Big Ben".
"This is an opportunity to have a bit of devolution, devolve the sound. The BBC moved out to Salford, now we can devolve the sound to Nottingham," he said.
Horologist Mr Lyon was bursting with pride at the sound of the bell.
"It is considered to be the best set of clock bells in the country. The main bell here is Little John. It is 10.5 tonnes and on a clear day you can hear it seven-and-a-half miles away down the Trent valley," he said.
"It's got a beautiful tone - far better than Big Ben because Big Ben was cracked when it was put in and has never been altered. It has rather a tinny sound unlike Little John which is mellow."
The BBC and parliament remain firmly tight-lipped on any decision on what could replace the bongs, although it did prompt a discussion on PM on Monday.
