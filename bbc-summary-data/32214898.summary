[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six young voters from Wales who took part in an election debate geared around young people have described it as "brilliant" to "a lot of hot air".

More than 100 18-24 year olds took on five politicians in the debate organised by BBC's Newsbeat.
Trust was the main issue but tuition fees, gender equality and the voting age also dominated.
Voters were joined by politicians from five major parties at Leeds City Museum on Tuesday evening.
Sam Gyimah, from the Conservatives, Sadiq Khan of Labour, Sal Brinton from the Liberal Democrats, Mhairi Black of the SNP and Rhun ap Iorwerth, from Plaid Cymru were all in the line of fire.
BBC Wales followed six Welsh audience members to hear their views on the debate.
Guto Gwilym, 21, Lampeter
"It was brilliant to have that one hour that was purely focused on young people and the issues we have.  It was very much a night where politicians heard what we have to say and I very much hope that they've been taking notes.
"For me - one thing we do need to tackle urgently now is diversity among MPs."
Aled Illtud, 20, Aberystwyth
"It was nice to see a different kind of debate - it was much more energetic.
"I did feel like there were more questions than there were answers but that maybe reflects how passionate the audience members were.
"We seemed to have a battalion of questions thrown at the politicians.  It was beautiful to see but I would have liked more answers from the politicians."
Peter Gillibrand, 18, Carmarthen
"I think the debate concentrated too much on tuition fees. I would have liked to hear more about what politicians would do for disabled people like my brother. He's severely autistic but the funding for lots of the services he uses has been cut.
"I'm a Plaid Cymru voter but I think the real people who won this debate were the SNP and Lib Dems.
"The SNP lady was really inspirational and the lady from the Lib Dems came across well too.  She said 'look we made a mistake on tuition fees' but you felt she did really care about young people."
Robyn Holley, 21, Cwmbran
"It was everything I expected it to be - people shouting, lots of opinions whirling around and politicians just being politicians. I wasn't impressed by what they had to say - it was just a lot of hot air.
"I have considered not voting but I think I will probably turn out if only to try and change things."
Gwion Dafydd, 20, Pembrokeshire
"I think a couple of politicians said the right things. I liked that Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems all supported lowering the voting age for 16 and 17 year olds.  It shows they care about what young people have to say.
"I have more respect for some of the parties now."
Rhys Taylor, 21, Bangor
"I stood up and made a comment during the discussion on tuition fees. I think it's important that politicians admit when they've made a mistake and apologise if they can't carry through with their promises.
"It's not often that we hear politicians apologising but the more we can get them to own up to their mistakes the more we will be able to trust them."
