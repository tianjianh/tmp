[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fiorentina 0-0 AC Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josip Ilicic missed a first-half penalty for Fiorentina as AC Milan manager Vincenzo Montella secured a point on his return to Florence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Montella, who spent three seasons in charge of Fiorentina, would have taken Milan third in Serie A with a third successive win.
But they could not score and needed Ilicic's miss to avoid defeat.
Davide Calabria pulled back Borja Valero to concede the spot-kick but Ilicic drove his effort against a post.
Milan felt they should have had penalty in injury time, giving them the chance to become the first away team to score at Fiorentina this season.
But referee Daniele Orsato did not penalise Nenad Tomovic for a tackle on substitute Luiz Adriano which was right on the edge of the box.
