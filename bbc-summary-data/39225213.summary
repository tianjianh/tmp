One officer received a "stab wound to the arm" and another sustained a leg injury after being chased by the suspect, the force said.
A post-mortem examination showed both Ms James and her attacker died of stab wounds.
Det Insp Warren Hines, who is leading the investigation, said: "The family are absolutely devastated at the loss of Ann-Marie and Melvin, two people who were really dear to them.
"They have asked that their privacy is respected so they are able to grieve at this difficult time."
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has started an investigation.
