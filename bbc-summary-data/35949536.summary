[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cowdenbeath's resurgence continued with a third straight win, this time over Scottish League One bottom side Brechin City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greig Spence gave the hosts an ideal start with a close-range finish.
It remained 1-0 until the 70th minute when Lewis Spence turned home Jamie Robson's cross for the equaliser.
However, Cowden would muster a later winner as Chris Kane came off the bench to head in Declan Hughes' delivery and leave Brechin four points from safety.
