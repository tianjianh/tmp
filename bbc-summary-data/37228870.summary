The 29-year-old, who has won 11 caps for his country, joined the Baggies in 2014 from Hannover 96 but played just 21 times for the Premier League club.
Pocognoli will provide cover after Liam Rosenior suffered an ankle injury.
"Sebastien has a vast amount of experience having played in some of the top divisions in Europe," said Brighton manager Chris Hughton.
"He is the type of quality player we want to add to the squad, and we are looking forward to working with him."
