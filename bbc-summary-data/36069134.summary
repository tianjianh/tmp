Guy added to his 400m freestyle and 100m butterfly successes with gold in the 200m freestyle final, ahead of Stephen Milne and Robbie Renwick.
His time of one minute 45.19 seconds was within the Rio qualification mark.
"This has given me so much confidence and hopefully I can take that into Rio," Guy told BBC Sport.
Eight British swimmers - Guy, Adam Peaty, Andrew Willis, Max Litchfield, Ben Proud, Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, Jazz Carlin and Hannah Miley - secured automatic qualification for Rio 2016 through the trials.
Up to 22 further names could be added to the line-up this week.
The 200m freestyle event was one of the most keenly contested finals of the week, with all swimmers aware that a top-four finish would virtually guarantee them a place in the Rio 4x200m medley relay squad.
Guy, Milne, Renwick and Duncan Scott, who was fourth - and also won the 100m freestyle title earlier in the week - are in prime position for selection.
"Rio is going to be my third Olympics and this relay squad has so much potential," Renwick told BBC Sport.
"Yes, we won world gold last year, but we're not going to take anything for granted because we know other nations will come on strongly this year."
O'Connor also secured her third title with victory in the 100m breaststroke final on a busy night for the swimmer, who was also fourth in the 100m butterfly.
The London Olympian won the 100m freestyle final and her favoured 200m individual medley (IM) event earlier in the week, and admitted she has some difficult decisions to make about what to compete in at the Rio Games.
"The 200m IM is the priority and I don't want anything to distract from that, but it's good to get a race or two in before," she said.
"I'll sit down with my coach over the next couple of months to help decide, but it's always nice to have options."
Alys Thomas of Wales was the surprise winner of the 100m butterfly final in a time of 58.66 seconds, which was a personal best but over a second outside the qualifying mark.
"That's not something I was expecting because I'm more of a 200m swimmer, so I'm really happy," she said.
"I know I'm an underdog, not one to watch, but I like that position and whether the selectors will take me, I don't know, but I've done my best."
Double European Games champion Luke Greenbank, 18, secured his maiden senior British title with gold in the 200m backstroke final.
His time of 1:57.79 seconds was outside the qualification standard, but the junior world record holder has a strong chance of receiving one of six wildcard nominations GB Olympic selectors have at their disposal.
"It's a little slower than I would have liked, but it was a season's best," he said.
