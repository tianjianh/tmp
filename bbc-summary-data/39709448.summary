The England Lions left-hander (112 not out) shared decisive partnerships with captain James Vince (69) and Sean Ervine (33 not out) in a chase of 259.
Hampshire comfortably reached 260-4 with 29 balls to spare at Canterbury.
Earlier, Darren Stevens (60) top-scored for the hosts who were bowled out for 258 after making a promising start.
Alsop, 21, registered his second List A century and his second-highest score in the format off 132 balls, including 13 fours.
England international Vince did much of the early damage at the top of the visitors' order with 69 in just 50 balls, 60 of which came in boundaries.
Kent's innings slumped from 127-1, after Daniel Bell-Drummond (56) and Joe Denly (46) had laid a strong platform, to 194-6. Hampshire seamer Reece Topley (3-65) was the pick of the bowlers.
Hampshire captain James Vince told BBC Radio Solent:
"They got off to a decent start, so to claw it back from 70-0 after 10 overs, the bowlers stuck to our plans and kept them to what we felt was a gettable score.
"After losing Michael Carberry early, we built some decent partnerships and Tom Alsop, to bat through the innings, did a decent job there and was well supported by Sean Ervine at the end.
"My mindset batting in the powerplay was if they were slightly off their lengths, I was going to try and cash-in and it hit the middle of the bat nicely.
"I'm pleased for Tom, he did exactly what we needed from him, someone to grab hold of the innings and bat through. He played well down the ground and took the options he's best at."
