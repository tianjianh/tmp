The 25-year-old played 32 games for the Brewers last season and was set to sign a deal in June having verbally agreed new terms, but had a change of heart.
Manager Nigel Clough said: "Tom made a misjudgement. It was a few weeks ago and we now want to put that behind us."
Flanagan said he had listened to "some bad advice" but wanted to move on.
He added: "I had a change of heart and I'm regretful it has taken me this long.
"I want to thank the manager for his patience and understanding and I hope that the fans will also welcome me back."
