EFL 2016-17: 'Thunderclaps' among five things you may have missed

It has been another busy day in the English Football League, with 70 of the 72 clubs across the three divisions in action.

Huddersfield Town went to the top of the Championship table after scoring a late winner over Barnsley while early strugglers Blackburn and League One side AFC Wimbledon both registered their first point of the season.
Here, BBC Sport rounds up five other stories you may have missed from Saturday's EFL games.
Teenager Ryan Sessegnon is making waves at Fulham.
Having started on his league debut against Leeds on Tuesday, aged 16 years and 88 days, the left-back was named on the bench against Cardiff on Saturday but made his mark after coming on as a first-half substitute.
After replacing injured Floyd Ayite in the 41st minute, it took Sessegnon less than three minutes to give Fulham a 1-0 lead against the Bluebirds, in a game which eventually finished 2-2.
In doing so, the Londoner became the first player born in the year 2000 to score in the Championship.
Those of us old enough to remember the first year of the new millennium will be thrilled to find out that 'Oops! I Did It Again' by Britney Spears was top of the charts when Sessegnon was born in May 2000.
Garry Monk must be breathing a sigh of relief after recording his first league win as Leeds United head coach.
The 37-year-old former Swansea boss was reportedly already coming under pressure from owner Massimo Cellino after taking just one point from their opening three Championship games.
Cellino has gone through six managers since taking over the Elland Road club in April 2014, having already gained the nickname 'the manager eater' from his time in charge of Italian side Cagliari.
Defeat in a Yorkshire derby at Sheffield Wednesday could well have spelled the end for Monk, but his side capitalised on the counter-attack and second-half goals from Marcus Antonsson and Chris Wood gave the Whites a 2-0 victory over the Owls.
Monk will need to keep the results coming if he wants to avoid the fate of his six predecessors - Brian McDermott, Dave Hockaday, Darko Milanic, Neil Redfern, Uwe Rosler and Steve Evans.
A few eyebrows were raised when, following a takeover by a Chinese conglomerate, Wolves sacked Kenny Jackett on the eve of the season and replaced him with Walter Zenga.
However, the much-travelled former Italy goalkeeper, who has managed teams in Romania, Turkey and the Middle East as well as in his homeland, is yet to taste defeat since taking charge at Molineux.
Zenga's side pulled off what fans may regard as their best result so far on Saturday when they beat local rivals Birmingham 3-1 at St Andrew's to move them up to third in the Championship.
The third goal was scored by summer signing Jon Dadi Bodvarsson, and the side celebrated with the 'thunderclap' - made famous by Bodvarsson's Iceland at Euro 2016 - in front of the travelling supporters.
If you want entertainment this season, then maybe it is worth ditching your side and following Scunthorpe United instead.
The Iron are the top scorers in the whole of the EFL with 12, having bagged five unanswered goals against Gillingham on Saturday.
That win, the biggest margin of victory by any side this season, lifted Scunthorpe up to second in the fledgling League One table.
Only Bolton Wanderers, the only EFL side with a 100% league record this season, are above Graham Alexander's side.
There is a surprise name at the top of League Two after four games of the new campaign.
Morecambe finished 21st in the fourth tier last season, 12 points above the relegation zone, having lost 14 of their final 21 games.
But the Shrimps are the early pacesetters in 2016-17, having secured a third successive win with a 1-0 triumph at Yeovil Town courtesy of Kevin Ellison's second-half goal.
They host Premier League side Bournemouth in the EFL Cup this week and boss Jim Bentley must be hoping to continue their impressive start against the Cherries.
