Traders are to be temporarily relocated to make way for a Â£4.5m overhaul at Wrexham's indoor People's Market.

The council initially said it would remain open during the work to add an arts centre and improve facilities.
One trader said she and others were now in negotiations to temporarily relocate to the nearby Butcher's Market from next month.
The council has been asked to comment about the change of heart.
The plans, agreed in January, have proved controversial with some traders previously saying they wanted to move out rather than face disruption when the builders moved in.
Janette Partington, who runs a baby and children's wear stall in the People's Market, explained that a number of traders had already made their own plans to relocate and others were shutting up shop for good.
Ms Partington, a third generation market trader, said they have been told the work set to start in January could be completed eight weeks early if they all moved out.
She said the decision had come as "a bit of a surprise".
The council said traders would be relocated from 6 January so business was not affected over the Christmas period.
The work, scheduled to be completed by 2018, involves refurbishing the building, adding two galleries, performance areas, a gallery shop and market stalls.
The present gallery, Oriel Wrecsam, is situated in a shop unit next to the market.
There are about 10 stallholders in the market.
Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said: "I have written to the council to raise the concerns of traders after being told about the latest developments.
"What is needed most of all from the council is clarity about what is going on and what they are proposing - and quickly."
