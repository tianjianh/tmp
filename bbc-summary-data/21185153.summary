The 18-year-old joins the Championship leaders on a two-and-a-half-year deal for an undisclosed fee.
Healey has scored sixteen goals for the Nomads during this campaign and has signed with the Bluebirds until the summer of 2015.
"We think Rhys is one with huge potential." said Malky Mackay, the Cardiff City Manager.
"We brought Rhys in after having looked at the division to see what the best young talent is there - and we think Rhys is one with huge potential. "
"He'll be training with our Development Squad and Under 18s to start with. We'll try and bleed him in gently towards the senior setup and see how he develops, but he's certainly one with great potential for the future."
A Nomads statement wished Healey well and praised Cardiff for the "brilliant way they have worked with us, generous, patient and always courteous".
