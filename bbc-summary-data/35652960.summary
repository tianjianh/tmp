SNP MP Phil Boswell's office costs to be examined by standards body

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A formal investigation will take place into SNP MP Phil Boswell's use of the Westminster expenses system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Independent Parliamentary Standards Association said it would look at whether the politician was paid money "that should not have been allowed".
The claims focus on the Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill MP's office costs.
A spokesman for the SNP said Mr Boswell would "comply fully" with the investigation.
He added: "It would be inappropriate to comment further while the investigation is ongoing."
In a formal statement, the standards authority said: "The compliance officer has opened an investigation to determine whether Mr Phil Boswell MP has been paid an amount under the MPs' Scheme of Business Costs and Expenses that should not have been allowed."
This is the second parliamentary probe related to Mr Boswell, who was elected to the House of Commons in May last year.
In January this year, the parliamentary commissioner for standards opened an investigation after allegations were made that the MP had failed to register financial interests.
A complaint was reportedly made by a Liberal Democrat candidate claiming Mr Boswell had not properly recorded his directorship of Boswell and Johnston Ltd.
Two other SNP MPs - Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry - are currently suspended from the party after withdrawing from the whip.
Ms Thomson has been linked to property deals that led to a solicitor being struck off, while Ms McGarry is at the centre of a police investigation into claims that donations made to the Women for Independence group have gone missing.
Both deny any wrongdoing.
