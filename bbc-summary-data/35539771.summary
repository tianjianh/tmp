[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Archaeologists in Gwynedd have discovered what is thought to be a buried village on Anglesey.

The discovery was made at Rhuddgaer, near Newborough, following a survey using technology to map out buried features without digging holes.
The village is believed to date back to the 7th or 8th Century, after the Romans had fled Britain.
The Gwynedd Archaeological Trust said: "We don't have any others to compare it to as this is a first."
Volunteers joined students and staff from Bangor University to revisit the location where a fourth or fifth Century coffin was found in the 1870s. The coffin is now in Bangor Museum.
David Hopewell, senior archaeologist at the trust, said: "We didn't find the site of the coffin but the survey showed two or more phases of fields including typical medieval ridge and furrow cultivation, and more importantly what looked like seven or more buildings forming a small village.
"This is of great importance because scholars know next to nothing about this time in Wales. To see a whole village like this is a first in Wales and there are no parallels to compare it to."
