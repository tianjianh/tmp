A weather warning has been issued as temperatures are predicted to reach 34C (93F) in parts of England on Wednesday.

On Monday, thermometers reached 32.5C (90.5F) in north-west London - hotter than Rome, Ibiza or Miami.
But on Tuesday, while much of the country continued to bake, a weather front cutting across the British Isles meant temperatures in Newcastle struggled to get above 16C.
The Met Office has issued a level three amber heatwave warning until Thursday.
The warning, which is one step down from a national emergency, covers the whole of Britain and means "there is a 90% probability of heatwave conditions".
Public Health England (PHE) repeated its advice on how to "beat the heat", urging people to practise common sense by staying cool, drinking plenty of water and avoiding sunburn.
It also urged people to look out for others who may be in high-risk groups such as people with underlying heart and lung conditions, older people, babies and young children.
Dr Angie Bone, Head of PHE's Extreme Events team, said: "Some people in these groups may not be able to take steps to keep themselves cooler - so if you're able, ask your friends, family and neighbours if they need any support."
The RSPCA urged pet owners to walk their dogs in the morning or evening when it was less likely they could burn their paws and to keep fish tanks out of direct sunlight.
BBC weather presenter Chris Fawkes said: "Wednesday is probably going to be the hottest day of the heatwave with temperatures of up to 34C. If we do see highs of 34C - that would be the hottest June day we would have seen for 40 years."
The heatwave, however, is due to come to an abrupt end after thunderstorms, predicted on Wednesday night and into Thursday, bring fresher air in from the Atlantic.
