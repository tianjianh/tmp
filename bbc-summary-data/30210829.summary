Halo: The Master Chief Collection has given Xbox One gamers the chance to play as Microsoft's most iconic character for the first time.

However since getting their hands on the game, players have also had to spend many minutes waiting for online matches to be set up.
Lots of people are really frustrated about the delay.
Now the boss of the studio that made the game has said she's sorry.
"Please accept my heartfelt apologies for the delay and for the negative aspects of your experience to date," Bonnie Ross said in an online statement.
"We're doing everything in our power to resolve it as quickly as possible."
Halo games of the past have been famous for their online modes as well as the single-player campaigns.
And it's online issues that have caused most people to complain about the latest release.
Gamers aren't happy because of the time it's taking for matches to be set up with other online players - with some reporting up to 30 min delays.
A downloadable update was released last week to try and improve the situation, and fix some other issues as well, but it's still not clear if it's worked for everyone.
Bonnie Ross said: "We have encountered unexpected issues that were not apparent in our internal test environment and that have resulted in a frustrating experience, including long match-making times and low session success rates.
"Within 343 Industries and Xbox, I can assure you that resolving these issues is our number one priority."
Launched on 11 November this version is a remastering of the old Halo games with next-gen graphics, more online modes and extra content.
The franchise is very important to the console as Xbox marketing director in the UK Harvey Eagle told Newsbeat earlier this month: "It's a franchise that's worth more than $4bn dollars in revenue, that makes it one of the top grossing franchises not just in gaming but in entertainment.
"So that makes it incredibly important not just for Xbox, but for gaming in general as well."
That means that everyone involved with the game is taking these issues very seriously.
Bonnie Ross said: "While our team works on continual improvements and towards solutions, my commitment to you is that we will take care of all owners of Halo: The Master Chief Collection.
"Our primary and continued focus is first on fixing the issues at hand.  Once we've done that, we will detail how we will make this right with our fans."
