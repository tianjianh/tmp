[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Isaiah Wright-Young, 37, was one of two men who opened fire on a Seat Ibiza that Kenichi Phillips was sitting in on St Marks Crescent, Birmingham, last year, police said.
Wright-Young was convicted of murder and is to serve a minimum of 33 years.
In November, Disharn Downie, 18, was jailed and will serve a minimum of 21 years.
Dean Silvera, 37, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years after being convicted of assisting an offender.
Mr Phillips, a passenger in the car, was struck in the jaw and neck in March last year, the West Midlands force said.
It said two others in the car escaped uninjured. Mr Phillips got out through the driver's door, but collapsed in a nearby alleyway and died.
Wright-Young, of no fixed abode, was convicted of murder, attempted murder and two counts of possessing firearm with intent to endanger life at Birmingham Crown Court.
Det Insp Jim Munro, who led the investigation, said it was "only through luck alone that others weren't seriously hurt".
He said: "Two men armed with guns firing shots in the early evening when there were people, including children, out and about who could easily have been caught up in this."
Downie, who was 17 at the time of the death, was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, two charges of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and a separate offence of robbery after a trial.
Silvera, of Dial Close, Druids Heath, Birmingham, was convicted of assisting an offender but cleared of murder, attempted murder, attempting grievous bodily harm and two counts of possession of a gun.
