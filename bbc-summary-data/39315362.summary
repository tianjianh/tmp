The 40-20 defeat was Wales' second loss of the campaign to finish third.
Holders England, Australia and Samoa will be their opponents at this summer's World Rugby Under 20 Championship in Georgia.
"We'll re-group, get back to training and build for the World Cup," Williams said.
"We've got a fantastic brand of rugby and I'm disappointed we didn't implement that.
"The last two games we've been brilliant and it's disappointing to end on such a disappointment. Every single game you learn.
"We'll go back on the training field and work on that, see what we did wrong and we'll put that right for the World Cup."
Wales' six-try defeat by France in Montauban came after back to back wins over Scotland and Ireland following a loss to England and win in Italy.
Jason Strange's side held an early 13-0 lead but a disappointing second half saw France run out winners.
"We went off script a little bit," Williams told BBC Wales' Scrum V.
"No discredit to France, who were brilliant, but I don't think we were at the races at all.
"We had a good 20-30 minutes but after that we just fell off tackles and from didn't think we were good enough."
