According to Associated Press, the rapper, whose real name is Ackquille Pollard, was taken into custody after leaving a studio on Wednesday night.
Pollard, along with several others, will be formally charged on Thursday.
The 20-year-old has been featured on Radio 1Xtra's Hot for 2015 list.
He's best known for his track Hot Boy, with his recent rise to fame being helped by the accompanying Shmoney Dance going viral.
Since the video went online in August it has been viewed nearly 50 million times.
The dance triggered fan-generated memes, Vines and uploads of celebrities including Jay Z, Beyonce and Rihanna and Justin Bieber doing their version of the dance.
Shmurda recently told 1Xtra's DJ Semtex he was "speechless" about the success of the track.
He was encouraged to rap by his brother after returning home from a juvenile detention centre and said: "The turning point was when I started seeing the fans pulling up on my block yelling.
"I thought, 'We got fans. I gotta change my life around, start doing better.'"
Chad Marshal, another aspiring hip-hop artist known as Rowdy Rebel, was arrested at the recording studio near Radio City Music Hall in Manhattan where police also recovered handguns, according to reports.
