Originally designed by Liverpool architect Herbert Rowse, the Grade II-listed building first welcomed audiences in 1939 but was closed in May for a revamp of the main concert hall and auditorium.
Architects Caruso St. John, who have worked on the Barbican and Tate Britain in London, led the renovation, which included the grand foyer, now with a chandelier made of bottles.
They researched Rowse's influences among the 1930s modern architecture movement. Original building features have been "enhanced with colour and lighting and a new-look floor", an orchestra spokeswoman said.
The changes to the concert hall are the first part of the overhaul of the interior, due for completion next summer. But Michael Eakin, chief executive of Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, said the orchestra was "keen to welcome audiences back to the hall for concerts and events as soon as we could".
Conductor Vasily Petrenko (left) led the first concert in the restored venue on Thursday, including a world premiere from the American composer James Horner (right), best known for his film soundtracks on Titanic and Apollo 13.
The orchestra also performed music by Russian composer Tchaikovsky, born in 1840 - the year the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic was formed.
The auditorium also showcases the Greek Muses, considered to be the patron goddesses of poets and musicians, according to mythology.
