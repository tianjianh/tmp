East Lindsey council seeks pool delays compensation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lincolnshire council has said it is seeking compensation over delays to a new leisure centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £12m Meridian Leisure Centre in Louth opened in February 2010 after being delayed by contractor UCS Civils going into administration.
East Lindsey District Council now wants a £300,000 bond to be paid out to cover extra costs it incurred.
Officials said they were in a "constructive dialogue" with insurers but could not give a timescale.
The £300,000 bond was put in the original contract in case the contractor could not complete its part of the work.
The project was approaching completion when UCS Civils went out of business in November 2009.
The council said subsequent delays and the expense of finding new builders means the bond should be paid out.
Council chief executive Nigel Howells said: "We think we have incurred costs of that sort of order.
"So we are pursuing this and like most insurance companies, they are looking closely at it and we are in a constructive dialogue with them to get at the money."
