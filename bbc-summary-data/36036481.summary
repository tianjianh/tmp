[SN]TITLE[SN]
All Bar One to open in Aberdeen's Marischal Square

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A leading drinks and restaurant chain is to open a bar in the Marischal Square development in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All Bar One has agreed a deal to establish its first presence in the city.
It will be the chain's fourth Scottish outlet, with two already in Edinburgh, and one in Glasgow.
Marischal Square is expected to open in the summer of next year. Offices and a hotel are being built on the site of the former council headquarters.
It is a Â£107m development.
Protestors failed in their bid to get the development halted last March.
Councillors voted by 22-21 to continue with the project.
