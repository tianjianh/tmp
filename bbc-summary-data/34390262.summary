[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Vevar, 64, of Wrexham, denied inciting a boy to indecently assault another and physical assault while working at Bryn Alyn Community, a firm which ran children's homes.
A jury at Mold Crown Court found him not guilty of both counts on Tuesday.
He said the acquittals had ended a period of "hell".
Operation Pallial was set up by the National Crime Agency after allegations emerged from children aged between six and 19 who had been at care homes across north Wales between 1953 and 1995.
Mr Vevar told the court during the proceedings the allegations - which dated as far back as 1978 - were rubbish.
Speaking after the hearing, he said: "This has been hell on earth for me - a massive injustice bringing me to court.
"It has destroyed my life completely," he added. "It has driven me to have to take anti-psychotic drugs."
Mr Vevar, who has taken early retirement due to ill-health, criticised Operation Pallial, saying: "There are a lot of innocent people being persecuted."
