Get Inspired: FA People's Cup inspired Paul Baker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The FA People's Cup is a free amateur tournament that gives people in England the chance to compete in a 5-a-side football tournament with the possibility of a VIP trip to Wembley.

You don't have to be in a team to get involved, simply sign up as an individual and you will be put into a team. There will be special 'squad-building' events before the tournament for individuals to meet their new team-mates. So if you've been looking for an excuse to get back into football then this is for you.
There are 10 different categories open to all footballers, male and female, from under 14s to walking football for the over 50s.
Paul Baker played in the first ever FA People's Cup, signing up as an individual in the veterans category in Manchester.
I saw the FA People's Cup advertised on Match of the Day and because it was an FA tournament I really wanted to play. I couldn't get a team together but I knew I had to play in it. It was such a big deal and I didn't want to miss out so I signed up as an individual.
On the day I was assigned a squad, we had a little practice time and decided who was going to play where. We gelled well together but we weren't as good as the permanent teams.  We had a laugh and shared a great sense of achievement through playing.
I was inspired by the event. Everyone grows up watching the FA Cup so it's incredible to be part if it!  I scored a goal in last year's FA Cup - how many people can say that?
No matter what your age or ability you can sign up and see how you get on.  You don't even have to register as a team to be involved.  I have signed up as an individual again this year and I'm really looking forward it.
I would urge people sign up as it is a big thing to kick a ball in a tournament that carries the FA name.
"I will keep playing as long as possible"
I have been playing football as long as I can remember. I am now 44 and I still play at least once a week. I'm not in a team but I am part of a mailing list so I can pick a game up on a Monday night or find out about games on social media.
I had a hip operation four years ago but this hasn't stopped me playing. Nine months after the operation I was back on the pitch.
I had to rebuild the muscle in the joint and after playing, my hip would hurt but I wanted to play and the surgeon said it wasn't doing any damage so I put up with the pain. I am now part of a fitness academy which keeps me in shape both physically and mentally and will hopefully help me to keep on playing as long as possible.
"I have suffered with depression and it is football that that has made a difference to me"
Football is my passion, it's one of the few things in life where you get out what you put in.  It is hard to sum up exactly why I love it so much, it's just a beautiful game.
I have had depression and it is football that that has made a difference to me. It's sport that I wake up for.
When the trauma and depression comes it's about finding that bit of something to keep going; football gives me a strong sense of togetherness and mindfulness. I have questioned everything in life but there is something about kicking a ball that just helps. Once you've played a game, you feel a sense of achievement and that helps keep you going.
