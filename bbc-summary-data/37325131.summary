[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brentford 5-0 Preston North End

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scott Hogan scored a hat-trick as Brentford grabbed four goals in the last 15 minutes to thrash Preston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker broke free of the visiting defence for his first, showing composure to find the bottom corner.
Eoin Doyle's flick was tipped on to the post for Preston, but Harlee Dean drove home a second and Marnick Vermijl's injury meant Preston ended with 10 men.
That allowed Hogan to round the keeper to net his second, and he completed his treble after Chris Humphrey's own goal.
Brentford's victory lifts them into the play-off positions, while the Lilywhites are now only a point above the bottom three.
Humphrey's own goal came from a Joshua Clarke cross - his attempted clearance going into the net.
Meanwhile, Hogan, who now has 13 goals in 16 Championship appearances for the Bees, completed his treble after running into the channel and striking into the top corner.
Brentford manager Dean Smith: "I thought we started both halves slowly. There was a little bit of me that thought that might happen because of the Villa game in midweek.
"We looked tired but we grew into both halves and started to play our game.
"He (Scott Hogan) was magnificent and gave a real captain's display. He led by example, won his headers, was good on the ball and drive us on in the first half when we looked a little languid at times."
Preston boss Simon Grayson: "We started well and were on top, created good chances and counter attacked well and then Brentford scored against the run of play.
"We started positively but then they scored their second and it bred a lack of responsibility through the team. From then on it was a kamikaze performance.
"You have to play with your head and not your heart but we bombed on looking to get back into it when we didn't need to. At that point it's all about players taking responsibility on the pitch."
