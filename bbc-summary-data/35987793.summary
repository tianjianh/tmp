A judge has ordered an in-depth risk assessment on a rapist who attacked a property manager while she was inspecting his Midlothian home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Stevenson, 39, was convicted of raping the 51-year-old at his home in Gorebridge on 18 March 2015 earlier.
Stevenson was due to be sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow on Thursday, but Lord Kinclaven ruled he needed more information.
Sentence was deferred on Stevenson until June.
Lord Kinclaven told Stevenson: "Given the fact you have two High Court convictions and the nature of this offence I am going to ask for a detailed report in relation to risk."
Stevenson continues to protest his innocence.
Stevenson attacked his victim as she was about to leave his home, grabbed her by the neck and forced her into a bedroom.
In a bid to stop the attack she told Stevenson she was pregnant.
The woman fought back, kicking and biting him, and managed to leave Stevenson's house, drove to a hospital and then called the police.
In evidence she said: "He grabbed me from behind by my neck. He told me that I wasn't going anywhere.
"He said 'shut up' and 'just be a good girl.' He said it would be all over in ten minutes.
"I was just shocked. I then said 'please let me go. I'm pregnant. I need to go to the hospital. I have an appointment. I need to go. I need to go.
"He told me to shut up."
She said: "I knew it was do or die. I started kicking him. I started screaming. He put his hand in my mouth. He said 'shut up, shut up. I'm going to kill you."
The court was told Stevenson has two High Court convictions one for assault to danger of life in 1998 for which he was jailed for six years and another for assault in 2002 for which he received four years.
Defence counsel Frances Connor said Stevenson had had a troubled childhood and was addicted to alcohol and legal highs.
