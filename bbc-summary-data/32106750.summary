The Rollright Stones is made up of three Neolithic and Bronze Age megalithic monuments, high on the Oxfordshire - Warwickshire border.
Rollright Trust head George Lambrick accepted the Dark Sky Discovery award at Long Compton Village Hall.
The award recognises places that provide good views of the stars, which are accessible to everyone.
Chairman of Chipping Norton Amateur Astronomy Group, Robin Smitten, who is also a trustee of the stones, said: "It is a fitting end to seven or eight months of work."
The Rollright Stones has featured in TV's Stargazing Live and The Sky at Night.
Mr Smitten said the group would now turn its focus to improving views of the night sky in other areas of the Cotswolds.
