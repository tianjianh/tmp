Eleven specialist doctors are to become a permanent part of the Yorkshire Air Ambulance team thanks to a new "dedicated and funded system".

Dr Andrew Pountney, clinical lead for the new team, said for the past 10 years doctors had been released to the helicopter unit on an "ad hoc" basis.
The new Yorkshire Critical Care Team will be a collaboration of the county's ambulance and air ambulance services.
It will include consultants in emergency medicine and anaesthesia.
Dr Pountney said: " ...thanks to this initiative we now have a dedicated and funded system to ensure that a consultant with appropriate training and experience in pre-hospital emergency medicine can respond every day of the year."
The team will carry additional drugs and the doctors will be able to perform emergency anaesthesia and life-saving surgical procedures at the scene of an incident, a spokesperson for the Yorkshire Air Ambulance service said.
The doctors have been seconded by their host trusts and will join paramedics on the helicopter 12 hours a day, every day of the year.
