Jason Gates, 39, was reported missing on 17 March.
Police have received a sighting of him in Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness, on 14 March. His dog was also found on farmland close to the village.
In their new appeal, Mr Gates' family said they were increasingly anxious about his wellbeing.
His family said: "We're very grateful to members of the emergency services and search and rescue personnel who continue the search for Jason.
"We'd like to thank members of the local community for their assistance and to everyone who has shared the appeal via social media.
"It's been over three weeks since we've heard from Jason and we are increasingly anxious.
"We'd also like to appeal to Jason directly. If you can see this message, please make contact so we know you're ok. We just want you to be safe and to be reunited as a family."
Insp Ian Graham, of Police Scotland, said officers with search dogs continued to make searches of areas around Drumnadrochit.
He added: "We are continuing to keep Jason's family updated and provide them with support at this difficult time."
Mr Gates has been described as 6ft 3in, of slim build. He has short grey hair and stubble. It is not known what clothes he was wearing but he was often known to wear black jeans, a T-shirt, and a black padded jacket or a tweed jacket.
