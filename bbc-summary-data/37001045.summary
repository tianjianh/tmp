[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queens Park Rangers moved to the top of the Championship after two late goals secured victory over goal-shy Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Cardiff defender Steven Caulker broke the deadlock, heading home Jake Bidwell's cross.
QPR sealed victory with Tjarron Chery's penalty after Sebastian Polter was brought down by Bruno Manga.
Cardiff managed only one shot on target and have failed to find the net in their first three games this season.
Bluebirds boss Paul Trollope reverted to the side which had started in the 0-0 draw at Birmingham City on the opening day, having made six changes for the midweek EFL Cup loss at Bristol Rovers.
Trollope's QPR counterpart and ex-Cardiff striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink made one change from the side which had beaten Leeds 3-0 on the opening day with Jordan Cousins replacing Olamide Shodipo.
Caulker gave Cardff an early warning, heading over following a corner from Ben Gladwin, who would be replaced by Yeni Ngbakoto after suffering an ankle injury.
Both sides failed to hit the target during an opening period bereft of chances however the visitors came close to breaking the deadlock early in the second half.
Anthony Pilkington headed over the bar in response for Cardiff, who handed a debut to new signing Emyr Huws off the bench in a bid to break down a stubborn QPR defence.
But within a minute of the introduction of the Wales midfielder and fellow substitute Kenneth Zahore, Caulker opened the scoring after several chances.
The former England international, who scored five goals during a solitary season with the Bluebirds in 2013-14, headed home Bidwell's delivery to give his side the lead.
The Rs doubled the lead with five minutes remaining with Chery scoring from the penalty spot, his second goal of the season, after Manga had hacked down Polter.
Cardiff City manager Paul Trollope said: "We didn't think our goal was under too much threat. QPR came at us in the second half and pushed us back, but it's very disappointing to concede two goals from set-plays.
"They were both from poor decisions by our defenders, firstly to concede the free-kick for the first goal in an innocuous position.
"Then, when you're hoping to find a way back, the defender (Manga) lunged in with the player's back to him, so we can't argue with the penalty decision."
