The former Melbourne Tigers assistant will work with fellow countryman Daryl Corletto, who has signed a two-year extension as Raiders player-coach.
White will also manage the British Basketball League side's academy.
"Daryl and myself share many values - we are dedicated to the pursuit of excellence and the commitment to organisational culture," he said.
"We bring a commitment to the team above the individual, and open and honest communication to build relationships."
Corletto, 34, replaced former head coach Jay Marriott in October 2015 and guided Raiders to ninth last season, missing out on the play-offs.
The club say they will announce their first two player signings on Friday.
"Appointing Jonathan as the head coach allows Daryl to concentrate more on playing during games, which can only be a good thing for him and the team going forwards," said chairman Bob Widdecombe.
Corletto added: "I'm really looking forward to helping the club reach their goals on court, which it has been starved of in recent years."
