[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow maintained their 100 per cent home record as Byron Harrison's late strike earned a come-from-behind win over visiting Braintree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Braintree took a 21st-minute lead from the penalty spot, with Chez Isaac sending Joel Dixon the wrong way. With the break approaching Andy Parry went close for Barrow with a shot from mid-range but soon after they were level when Richie Bennett headed home.
Early in the second half Jordan Williams forced a good save from Braintree 'keeper Jamie Butler and with 20 minutes to go Danny Livesey almost put Barrow ahead with a fantastic header that was superbly kept out by Butler.
But in the 87th minute Harrison smashed home after Alex-Ray Harvey's shot came back off the post.
