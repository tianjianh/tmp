[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leslie Barrett died instantly when 28-year-old Faisal Ali crashed into his car on the A171 near Tranmire, North Yorkshire, on 8 September 2013.
Ali, who denied causing death by dangerous driving, was found guilty at York Crown Court on 19 February.
He was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court, where he was also banned from driving for four years.
North Yorkshire Police said Ali, of Oxford Road, Middlesbrough, had been driving his white Mercedes car at speed when he overtook a vehicle on double white lines.
The businessman smashed into Mr Barrett's Vauxhall Vectra, which was travelling in the opposite direction.
Mr Barrett, from Sleights, near Whitby, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.
His daughter, Claire Sinclair, read a statement out in court. In it she said Ali had shown "no acceptance of his flagrant disregard for the road or its users".
"Because of his refusal to face up to and accept his guilt, our family has had to endure an agonising 18 months wait and have the harrowing nature of a full trial before a right and just verdict was reached."
