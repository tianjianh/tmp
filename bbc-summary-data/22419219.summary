Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg calls for Conservative/UKIP pact

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Somerset MP is calling for an electoral pact between the Conservatives and the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset, said the two parties could merge.
Mr Rees-Mogg also wants UKIP leader Nigel Farage to replace Nick Clegg as Deputy Prime Minister.
"I think that would be a better bet for Conservatism and the right wing in British politics," he said.
His comments come after Conservative calls for the party to change course to win back voters who switched to UKIP in England's local elections.
