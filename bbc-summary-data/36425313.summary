The men bought weapons and two Italian scooters ahead of the raid at the Mappin and Webb store in March 2015.
But police were tracking them and moved in before they could act.
Officers spotted four of the London-based gang in a reconnaissance of the Fife town a week before the planned raid.
Kevin Mulheron, 34, who was originally from Glasgow, was sentenced to seven and a half years imprisonment.
The gang used his brother's flat in Govan to finalise plans for the robbery.
He was joined by Peter Attwood, 44, his son Louie, 21, and Kai McGinley on a trip to St Andrews in late February last year.
The court heard that Peter Attwood hired a BMW in London while his son bought sledgehammers, holdalls, motorcycle helmets, jackets and waterproof trousers.
Two Piaggio scooters were ferried north having earlier been stolen in London, the jury was told.
In court, Attwood was jailed for nine years while his son was imprisoned for five years.
McGinley was also sentenced to five years.
'Caught in the act'
All seven members of the gang were arrested in St Andrews as they prepared to carry out the heist.
Paul Hogwood, 56, was jailed for 10 years.
During the trial, the court was told that Hogwood made a telephone call while on remand.
During it, he said: "If they had turned up 10 minutes later, they would have caught us right in the act."
Thomas Slayford, 20, received a five and a half year sentence and Benson Aluko was jailed for five years.
