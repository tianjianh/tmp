Holly Smith, 30, from Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, collected coupons to donate the shopping trip items to a charity.
She and her husband filled six trolleys with 429 items at Tesco in Lowestoft.
Among the items she purchased with coupons were 200 packets of sausages.
Mrs Smith, who has Asperger's Syndrome and a debilitating illness, collected the coupons over a five week period as part of a fundraising effort for Norfolk charity The Benjamin Foundation.
"The checkout process with coupons is slow and we were expecting it to take about five hours, but it took six and a half hours in total - it went fantastic," she said.
"People with Asperger's tend to focus on certain things and for me that's extreme couponing, freebies and bargain hunting."
The couple were give their own dedicated till at the store and the manager made sure all the products they had coupons for were in stock.

63 Tubs of soup

Callum Smith, 26, her husband, said: "Tesco claim back from the companies that offer the coupons and they couldn't have been more helpful.
"Before I met Holly, I was flippant about money, but now I've bought into the whole concept of coupons and watching your pennies."
As well as Asperger's, Mrs Smith was diagnosed with a stomach condition and a bone tumour which meant she had to give up work.
She has used her spare time to write a money-saving blog and set up a website offering savings advice.
