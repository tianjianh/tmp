American holidaymaker Susan McLean, 61, was last seen on CCTV in Aberfeldy at about 19:45 on Sunday 17 May.
She was on Crieff Road outside the grounds of Moness Resort.
Following police appeals, witnesses have come forward to say that a woman matching Ms McLean's description was seen near the Gatehouse Nursery garden centre at about 20:00 that night.
The person was wearing a dark coat with the hood up and light-coloured trousers and was seen walking south on the A826 out of Aberfeldy.
Police want to establish the identity of the person to confirm if it was Ms McLean or someone else.
Anyone who remembers walking in the area at the time should contact Police Scotland.
Officers are also keen for information about any further sightings of this woman in the area.
Ms McLean was on a two-week tour of Scotland with her family who have appealed for anyone with information to contact police.
Over the weekend, specialist teams from Police Scotland, including Tayside Mountain Rescue with dogs, will continue to search the area, southwards along the A826 and south-west of Aberfeldy towards the town's distillery.
It will be two weeks on Sunday since Ms McLean went missing.
A police spokesman said: "We would like to thank the public for the tremendous support they have given so far.
"As our search continues, we ask that if you were in Aberfeldy at the time Susan went missing and you think you might know something that would be of interest to our inquiry, please tell us.
"It is possible you have a piece of information that could help progress our inquiries. Please call us and let us decide what information may or may not be of value."
Ms McLean, who has an American accent, is described as being 5ft 8in tall, of medium build, with short fair hair and green eyes. When last seen she was wearing a black and grey waterproof jacket, beige khaki trousers and light-coloured trainers.
