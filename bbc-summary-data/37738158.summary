[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 1-2 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Nichols scored a stoppage-time winner as Peterborough fought back to beat Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker was left with a simple finish from eight yards after substitute Gwion Edwards had got past Tom Lockyer to deliver a low cross from the left.
Rovers took the lead when Matt Taylor hit his 11th goal of the season from the penalty spot following a foul by Shaquille Coulthirst on Dan Leadbitter.
Coulthirst made amends five minutes later, firing home the equaliser from close range after Michael Smith's effort, following a calamitous error by Rovers keeper Kelle Roos, had been blocked.
Roos spilled a seemingly straightforward cross and his mistake turned the game.
Rovers had the better of few first-half chances, top scorer Taylor seeing a low 40th-minute shot deflected narrowly wide.
Luke McGee made a diving save to deny Charlie Colkett, while Rory Gaffney shot too close to the Peterborough keeper from a good opening just before the interval.
Posh's best first-half effort was a low 25-yard drive by Nichols after he turned his marker on 23 minutes, but Roos saved, diving to his right.
