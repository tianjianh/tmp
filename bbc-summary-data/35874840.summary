Repairs to the Victorian structure have taken two years, following a major fire which severely damaged the 140-year-old structure in 2010.
More than 50 miles of new planking and more than 500,000 fixings have been used in the Â£15m renovation.
The Madness star, who was born in Hastings as Graham McPherson, said: "Going on the pier was always a really happy time... It's a privilege to be involved.  I can't really say I had a hand in building it but at least I can say I was involved."
The pier is expected to be fully operational by mid-April.
