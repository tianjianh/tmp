The boyhood Atleti fan, who is out of contract this summer, scored twice in the opening 11 minutes, netting from close range and hooking home a volley.
The 33-year-old scored more La Liga goals at the Calderon than any other player in the 21st century - with 54.
Inaki Williams pulled one back before Angel Correa's 89th-minute strike.
After the game, Atletico manager Diego Simeone stressed that he would remain at the club next season.
The Argentine had two spells as an Atletico player and has enjoyed a successful five and a half years as manager during which he has won La Liga (2013-14) and reached the Champions League final twice (2013-14 and 2015-16).
"The journalists ask me constantly if I am going to stay. Yes, I am going to stay," Simeone told the crowd inside the stadium.
"And do you know why I am going to stay? I am going to stay because this club has a future and this future is all of us.
"There are other teams that may have more money, a few trophies more than us, but they will never match the feeling you have for Atletico."
Correa's goal for Atletico, moments after coming off the bench, is the last league goal to be scored at the Calderon.
The final competitive match at the stadium, which is going to be knocked down to build flats, is next Saturday's Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Alaves.
Atletico, who played there for 50 years, now move to the 67,000-capacity Wanda Metropolitano, which is 10 miles away.
Torres, in his second spell with Atletico, has previously said: "My life and my memories are all connected to the Calderon, my greatest days as a supporter and as a player are in that stadium.
"Whenever I visit the area in the future, with the stadium not there, it's going to be difficult."
