Hampshire captain James Vince will sit out the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction in a bid to press his case for a place in England's Test match side.

Vince, who has played both one-day and Twenty20 cricket for England, averaged 28.57 in the 2015 County Championship.
The 24-year-old intends to focus on his county captaincy, Hampshire director of cricket Giles White confirmed.
"His head's screwed on," said White. "James is looking at it broadly and can see what's ahead of him right now."
Vince was appointed Hampshire captain last season, replacing Jimmy Adams.
The right-hander finished leading run scorer in last season's T20 Blast competition and during his debut T20 series for England against Pakistan in the UAE in November.
"James is very much in the space that he wants to play Test cricket," White told BBC Radio Solent.
"I think that if he were to go to the IPL auction, for him at the moment, it might narrow that opportunity.
"Runs early season in county cricket here, captaining Hampshire, will push his case."
Vince is currently playing for Karachi Kings in the inaugural Pakistan Super League being held in the UAE.
He is also hoping to be selected in England's squad for March's T20 World Cup in India, which will be named on Monday.
