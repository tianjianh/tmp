Sharon Wall, 53, from Gloucester, was attacked on Wednesday at the inpatient unit of Wotton Lawn Hospital.
Her employers said she would be deeply missed by colleagues and those she supported through her work.
Gloucestershire Police has been granted more time to question a man in his 60s being held on suspicion of murder.
Shaun Clee, chief executive officer of the 2gether NHS Foundation Trust, said: "The extremely sad event, which resulted in the death of a highly compassionate and dedicated colleague, has had a profound impact on everyone working in our trust.
"Sharon Wall was a well respected healthcare assistant and everyone who knew her speaks about her warmth, caring nature and good sense of humour.
"We are still in the early stages of the investigation and continue to assist Gloucestershire Police in their work.
"Above all, our thoughts remain with Sharon's friends and family. On behalf of colleagues across our trust, I extend our most sincere and deepest sympathies."
Gloucestershire Police said its officer were working to "secure and preserve further evidence".
Det Ch Insp Steve Porter, the senior investigating officer, said: "The family are extremely distressed at the tragic loss of their loved one and have asked for some privacy and time to grieve during this difficult period."
Wotton Lawn is an 88-bed acute mental health hospital with four admission wards, a psychiatric intensive care unit and a low secure unit.
It is one of four sites 2gether runs in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. The trust said it cares for more than 1,300 people a year in its hospitals.
The facility is yards away from Gloucester's main Royal Hospital, where workers spoke of their "shock" at Ms Wall's death.
