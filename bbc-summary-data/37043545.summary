[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alexis Jay named new chairwoman of abuse inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Professor Alexis Jay, who led the Rotherham abuse inquiry, is to be the new chairwoman of the inquiry into child sex abuse in England and Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The appointment was announced by the home secretary after the resignation of judge Dame Lowell Goddard last week.
Prof Jay was already among the panel of advisers taking part in the independent investigation into claims made against public and private institutions.
She becomes the fourth head after the three previous chairwomen stood down.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: "The independent inquiry has a vital role to play in exposing the failure of public bodies and other major organisations to prevent systematic child sexual abuse.
"I'm delighted Professor Alexis Jay has agreed to chair the inquiry. She has a strong track record in uncovering the truth and I have no doubt she will run this independent inquiry with vigour, compassion and courage."
Ms Rudd added that the government's commitment to the inquiry remained "undiminished".
Professor Jay, 67, led the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham which found that at least 1,400 children were subjected to sexual exploitation in the town between 1997 and 2013.
Professor Jay said: "I am committed to ensuring this inquiry does everything it has set out to do and does so with pace, with confidence and with clarity.
"Be in no doubt - the inquiry is open for business and people are busier than ever working hard to increase momentum.
"The panel and I are determined to make progress on all parts of the inquiry's work, including speaking to victims and survivors."
The inquiry has been beset by difficulties since it was set up in July 2014 to investigate allegations made against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions in England and Wales, as well as people in the public eye.
Justice Goddard, a New Zealand high court judge, was selected following the resignation of two previous chairwomen in 2014. Baroness Butler-Sloss, the former President of the High Court Family Division, and her replacement Dame Fiona Woolf, a leading lawyer, stood down over their links to establishment figures.
In her resignation letter, Justice Goddard said conducting such a widespread inquiry was "not an easy task" but "compounding the many difficulties was its legacy of failure which has been very hard to shake off".
Prof Jay, who has worked in local government for 30 years, is the first of the chairwomen who is not a lawyer.
BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said Prof Jay was regarded as having done a "very fine job" of leading the Rotherham abuse inquiry.
But he said questions would inevitably be asked about her lack of judicial experience as she oversees a "mammoth inquiry" that will require her to exercise quasi-judicial powers.
Our correspondent added that many legal experts consider the inquiry to be too large, with some saying it will take 10 years or more to complete.
Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, said Prof Jay was "clearly a suitable candidate with vast experience" but he said the public still needed a "full explanation" as to why Justice Goddard resigned.
Sarah Champion, Labour's shadow minister for preventing abuse and domestic violence, said Prof Jay was an "honest and fearless woman" and called on her to "swiftly bring about investigations and changes in practice so that more is done to prevent these horrific crimes".
