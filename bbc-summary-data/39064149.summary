Tories win Copeland by-election as Labour holds Stoke

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have won the Copeland by-election - beating Labour in a seat it has held since its creation in 1983.

Trudy Harrison won with 13,748 votes to Labour's Gillian Troughton's 11,601.
Ms Harrison hailed the victory - the first by-election gain by a governing party since 1982 - as "a truly historic event".
Labour's Gareth Snell held Stoke-on-Trent Central with 7,853 votes, seeing off a challenge from UKIP leader Paul Nuttall who got 5,233.
Labour had held both seats since their creation but was forced to defend them when two former frontbenchers, Tristram Hunt and Jamie Reed, resigned as MPs.
Eleven famous by-elections
Professor John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the Copeland result was the best by-election performance by a governing party in terms of the increase in its share of the vote since January 1966.
Ms Harrison, who had been joined by Prime Minister Theresa May on the campaign trail, got 44.3% of the vote, increasing the Conservatives' vote share by more than 8%.
In her victory speech, Ms Harrison said: "It's been very clear talking to people throughout this campaign that [Labour leader] Jeremy Corbyn doesn't represent them.
"They want a party which is on the side of ordinary working people, which will respect the way we voted in the referendum and which will build a country which represents everyone. That's why they voted for me tonight."
Mr Corbyn said the party's "message was not enough to win through in Copeland" but hailed victory in Stoke as a "decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division and dishonesty".
He added: "Labour will go further to reconnect with voters and break with the failed political consensus."
In Stoke-on-Trent, UKIP had hoped to capitalise on voters' leanings towards Brexit - the area voted strongly to leave the EU in June.
The questions facing Labour in Copeland are tumbling UKIP's way here in Stoke.
A party whose very success in achieving the thing they were set up to achieve, Brexit, brought with it a blunt question - what is the point of them now?
The answer sounded like this: winning traditionally Labour seats from Labour.
And yet here in Stoke-on-Trent, a hubbub of Brexiteer jubilation after the referendum, they failed.
UKIP insists this seat was always well down their target list.
But on a night where Labour was sufficiently vulnerable to lose a previously rock-solid seat in Cumbria, UKIP's still the bridesmaid not the bride in the Potteries.
All of which begs two questions: If not here, where? If not now, when?
Both the Labour and UKIP candidates had tough moments during their campaigns, with Mr Snell apologising over old social media posts about women appearing on television and Mr Nuttall facing a backlash over false claims he lost close friends in the Hillsborough tragedy.
But in his victory speech, the new Labour MP Gareth Snell said voters had "chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear".
"This city will not allow ourselves to be defined by last year's referendum and we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result," he said.
He said the result was "a victory for the whole Labour Party and Labour movement".
However Labour's share of the vote was 37% - slightly down on the 39.3% it got in 2015.
UKIP got 24.7% of the vote and the Conservatives, who came a close third, 24.4% - both slightly higher than their 2015 vote shares.
Speaking to journalists after the result, UKIP leader Mr Nuttall said his party's "time would come".
"There's a lot more to come from us," he said.
"We are not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere."
Amid rumours that the Tories might pull off a dramatic by-election gain, there was mounting anticipation in the Whitehaven sports centre hosting the count,
Unusually, election officials stopped ballot papers piling up in the trays carrying names for each candidate, meaning the final result was harder to predict.
The resulting cheer from blue-rosetted activists in the hall might have been heard all the way in Downing Street.
This is a significant political moment for Theresa May - the first time in decades a sitting government has ousted an opposition party from one of its seats in a by-election.
But the real fallout will be for Jeremy Corbyn, who has promised to reconnect with voters. He may be left trying to do so while facing further opposition from his own MPs.
UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said:  "The whole narrative of Paul's leadership depends on winning in Stoke is a nonsense."
Labour MP Jack Dromey, who ran Mr Snell's campaign, said: "I think as we win we need necessary humility because there is a view that Labour is no longer listening in the way it should do.
"I think what we have done in this community is precisely to do that.
"Are we yet a credible alternative government? No we're not. But tonight is a decisive moment."
