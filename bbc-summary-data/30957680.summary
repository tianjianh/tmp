City of London Police and armed officers were alerted to the incident on Liverpool Street just after 14:30 GMT on Thursday.
Three men on mopeds reportedly used sledgehammers to smash the shop windows before fleeing.
Officers chased three of the men to a car park in Gravel Lane where one man was arrested. The two others remain on the run.
The force said a sledgehammer and the machete were recovered and there were no reports of any injuries.
