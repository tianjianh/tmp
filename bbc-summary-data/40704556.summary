After joining from Montpellier in 2014, she has won the Continental Cup, WSL 1 title and Women's FA Cup with City.
"The past two years have been unforgettable and I couldn't be happier I'm extending my contract," she said.
The Scotland international, 26, missed out on going to Women's Euro 2017 because of an ankle injury.
