The cars affected are Prius and Lexus models from 2008 to 2012.
Toyota and other carmakers have over the past years been rocked by millions of recalls over problems with airbags from Japanese supplier company Takata.
The latest recall does not involve Takata products and the problem has not been linked to any fatalities or injuries.
The recall includes some 495,000 cars sold in North America, 743,000 in Japan as well as vehicles in Europe, China and other regions.
In a statement relating to the US recall, the carmaker said the vehicles had an airbag inflator that could have a small crack in a weld which could widen over time.
The airbag could partially inflate and parts of the inflator could enter the vehicle interior, leading to "an increased risk of injury".
Safety devices made by Takata have been linked to 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries.
Globally, 12 carmakers have been affected with more than 100 million Takata-related recalls under way or expected.
