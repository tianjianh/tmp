The Universities Academic Staff Union (UASU) said on Tuesday that they feared the missing students had been kidnapped by al-Shabab, Kenyan media report.
The ministry of education said that the UASU was spreading "unfounded rumours".
An assault by the Somalia-based al-Shabab group killed 148 people at Kenya's Garissa University last week.
An angry worded statement signed by Education Minister Joseph Kaimenyi said that it was "unfortunate" that the UASU would make these claims which would only "exacerbate pain and suffering of parents and relatives in mourning".
It also said that spreading such "rumours" could be against as security law passed last year.

The statement outlines the figures in an effort to show that everyone, alive or dead, has been accounted for but it may have added some ambiguity.
It says that 815 are confirmed to have been enrolled at Garissa University College and that 663 students were rescued.
The government gives the student death toll as 142, which when added to the number rescued still leaves 10 students unaccounted for.
