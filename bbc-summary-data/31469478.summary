There has been a call for a special meeting of Castlereagh Borough Council to discuss the closure of the Robinson Leisure Centre due to asbestos.

The centre was closed on Friday after asbestos was found in hard-to-access areas, and further survey work is being carried out.
Alliance Party councillor Michael Long said people needed information as soon as possible.
"It's important that this is looked at intensively," Mr Long said.
"We have called for a special council meeting to be called to discuss the temporary closure of the Robinson centre.
"Some people yesterday evening had turned up at the facility and were actually standing outside unaware what had happened.
"It's obviously very difficult for the council to communicate exactly what had happened given the short notice, but I think it's now important that we have a full and open discussion to allow people to know exactly what is going on."
Earlier, the mayor of Castlereagh said he hoped the closure of the east Belfast centre was a temporary measure.
The mayor, the DUP's Jack Beattie, said he did not think people should be alarmed.
"The (council) officer from Belfast, who are taking over this facility, had come in and found a small area somewhere not open to the public and he said there was some of this asbestos showing," he said.
"Our officers, not wanting to do the wrong thing, had decided in the afternoon that they would close it and further investigate it.
"The health and safety people will come in and have a look at it and then a report will come out."
In a statement on its website on Friday, Castlereagh Council said asbestos had been found "in a previously unrecorded and difficult to access area".
The asbestos was discovered during a building management survey.
The council said further survey work was ongoing and the Health and Safety Executive NI (HSENI) was working with them.
"As a precautionary measure, the council has taken immediate action to close the centre until the full results of the survey is known," the statement said.
"It should be noted that materials containing asbestos are commonly found in buildings of a similar age, however with regular monitoring and management the risk is negligible."
