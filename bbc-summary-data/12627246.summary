A new Tesco Extra superstore in Bridgwater has moved a step closer after Somerset County Council decided to sell land to the company.

The Conservative-run authority has agreed to sell its share of the Northgate site, where Sedgemoor Splash swimming pool used to be, for Â£4m.
Sedgemoor District Council agreed to sell its share of the land to the company for nearly Â£6m in January.
The supermarket giant wants to develop the entire area with offices and shops.
It will also develop nearby Brewery Fields by building a play area and water features and new footpaths and cycle paths to the town centre and docks.
The county council said selling the land would cover the cost of moving staff who currently work in offices on the Northgate site into district council offices at Kings Square.
It also said the move would save money as well as helping to improve an area of Bridgwater.
The Conservative-led district council will also receive Â£1m to make up for losing one of its car parks.
Campaign group Bridgwater Forward said the town did not need another supermarket as the site was next to a Sainsburys and an Asda, and a leisure centre should be built there to replace Sedgemoor Splash.
It is hoped a new pool will be built at Chilton Trinity school in the town.
Tesco has 12 months to apply for planning permission for the development.
