The visitors twice led early on through Joel Hodgson penalties, but Sarries got the first try against the run of play when Marcelo Bosch went over.
Two Owen Farrell penalties put the hosts 13-6 ahead at half time, and he added a third late in the second half.
Ashton secured the win when he crossed in his first appearance since being found guilty of biting in September.
The England winger, who has agreed a move to French Top 14 side Toulon at the end of the season, played 30 minutes as a replacement and capped his performance when he went over untouched in the right corner.
Saracens were unable to earn a bonus point as Newcastle matched them for long periods of the game.
And second-placed Wasps are now only behind the reigning champions on points difference following their bonus-point home win over Bath.
Falcons spent much of the early stages camped on the Sarries line, but they were twice forced to settle for penalties and rarely troubled the hosts' impressive defence from then on.
And their inability to turn pressure into points meant they also missed out on a losing bonus point and remain eighth in the table.
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:
"It is good to have Chris back in the team and scoring tries. It wasn't the best game for him to come back for but he got his name on the scoresheet.
"His attitude in training has been fine. He's been waiting for this chance to play again and now he's keen to get a couple of starts.
"We now just want to see more of what he's given the club over the last four years."
Newcastle director of rugby Dean Richards:
"We were our own worst enemy. We can moan about the referee's decisions but we had chances that we didn't take.
"It was disappointing not to get something because we matched them for most of the game."
