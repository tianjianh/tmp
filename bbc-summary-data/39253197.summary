The winger's match-winning try in the final of the sixth leg drew him level with Kenya's Collins Injera as the all-time leading try-scorer in the sevens.
South Africa still top the standings with 126 points but England are second on 103 points with four rounds to go.
The next leg of the series takes place in Hong Kong from 7-9 April.
In Canada, South Africa took the lead against England but the teams went in 7-7 at half-time before Norton sealed victory.
"It's been a surreal two days," said Norton.
"It's something I never felt I'd be in a position to do but I owe it to the team-mates who helped me get into try-scoring positions over the years."
