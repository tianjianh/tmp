Mostafa Khaziravi, 27, from Iran, was found at Ferroli in Branston, Staffordshire, on 17 November.
Staffordshire Police said the investigation was focussed on "identifying the person or persons who helped them to conceal themselves".
Arrangements are being made to repatriate Mr Khaziravi, the force said.
Mr Khaziravi, from Ahvaz in southern Iran, was identified by comparing DNA samples provided by his sister with his DNA profile, police said.
The body of teenager Khalid Sorki has been taken back to his family in the Turkmen Valley area of Afghanistan.
Det Ch Insp Dave Giles, from the force, said: "Identifying the two males and returning them to their bereaved families was our priority.
"The investigation is now concentrated on identifying the person or persons who helped them to conceal themselves in a crate amongst a delivery load and who may be facilitating the illegal movement of people into the UK."
The wooden crate had been part of a consignment of commercial boilers which left northern Italy on 5 October and entered the UK by ferry from Dunkirk to Dover three days later, police said.
The Staffordshire force said it was delivered to Ferroli in Branston later the same day where it remained untouched until staff became suspicious due to its smell and appearance.
