Cardiff council's controversial budget plans are in doubt, BBC Wales understands.

Opposition groups are in talks with Labour backbenchers about a new plan.
The Labour-run council put forward new budget proposals last week which include reducing funding for day centres, cutting around 600 jobs and increasing council tax by 5%.
The final budget will be voted on next week, but the opposition groups are now preparing an alternative.
Opposition leaders met the council's chief executive Paul Orders and two Labour members on Wednesday morning to discuss their proposals.
They would need support from several Labour rebels to stop leader Phil Bale's budget getting through.
Labour sources have told BBC Wales there is unhappiness within the 45-strong Labour group about Cllr Bale's proposed budget.
An announcement from the opposition on the details of their alternative proposal is expected on Friday.
A Cardiff council spokesman confirmed Wednesday's meeting took place but said it was "part and parcel" of the budget-setting process.
A Labour party spokesperson said: "Any breach of group whip in respect of the budget is likely to lead to very serious disciplinary action."
