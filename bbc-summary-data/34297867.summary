Gerry, who died last year after a long battle with illness, was a household name who won acclaim for his unique style of radio broadcasting.
He was honoured at a ceremony in Dublin on Friday night.
His wife Christine accepted the award and said he would have been "so, so proud".
Gerry's career with the BBC spanned almost 30 years.
He began at BBC Radio Foyle in 1985, based in his home city Londonderry - or Stroke City, as he famously preferred to call it.
His popular mid-morning programme, in which he shared his often distinctive take on life, was then broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster.
He stopped broadcasting in 2012 due to illness.
He had previously won Radio Academy awards and Royal Television Society awards and became the first Northern Ireland broadcaster to be inducted into the Radio Academy hall of fame.
Inductees in the PPI hall of fame are chosen by a group of their peers in the Irish radio industry.
"When I heard about this, I knew this would mean so much - it would've been what Gerry would've loved," Mrs Anderson told BBC Radio Ulster's Stephen Nolan Show.
"Of all the things he's had in the past, all deserving, this would've been a biggie for him.
"I'm so proud of him for that and he'll never be forgotten."
Peter Johnston, the director of BBC Northern Ireland, said Gerry had "great wit and mischief" but also brought "real wisdom and insight" to his work.
"This recognition from the PPI is a fitting tribute to a true legend of our industry, something which is often said lightly but is genuinely true of Gerry."
