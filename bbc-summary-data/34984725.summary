[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The wreck of a trawler that sank during World War One has been found by divers searching for Humber fishing boats lost during the conflict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The trawler Alberta had been converted to work as a mine sweeper when it was hit by one of the weapons it was dragging behind it, on 14 April 1916.
The boat went down in 22m (72.1ft) of water 35 miles north east of Grimsby.
The family of a man who died on the boat want to lay a wreath at the spot.
The Humber Vikings British Sub Aqua Divers who found the Alberta are part of the Shipwrecks of the River Humber project, which had been given Â£176,500 by the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to map all the lost fishing boats during the 1914-18 conflict.
The Alberta crew included Percy Horn, from Grimsby, who was aged 26 when the boat went down.
Grandson Mark Richardson, 50, also of Grimsby said: "It's brought some closure for my own dad, Dennis Richardson, who is now 80.
"He always thought the Alberta was sunk much closer to the Humber and he was amazed to discover it was so far out in the North Sea.
"He would love to be able to go out with divers and perhaps lay a wreath on the sea above where the wreck of the Alberta lies.
"It would mean a lot to him.
"We know about the trenches and the zeppelins from World War One, but it seems the Grimsby trawlers and their lost crews have been forgotten."
