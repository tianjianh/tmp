Broady and Watson struggled to make an impact in their first final as a pair with the top seeds from Chinese Taipei winning in just over an hour.
It is the Chan siblings' third trophy of the year.
Watson suffered a second-round singles defeat by Caroline Wozniacki, while Broady failed to get past round one.
The 26-year-old was beaten 6-2 6-2 by British top seed Johanna Konta.
"I want to thank my partner," Broady, who reached the women's doubles third round at Wimbledon with Watson this year, told BT Sport.
"We've been best friends since we were about nine years old so to arrive at a final together on the same side of the net is just awesome, and I really enjoyed playing with her."
