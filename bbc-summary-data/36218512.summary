[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Bradford Bulls have appointed Rohan Smith as their new head coach on a three-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 35-year-old has left his assistant coach role at NRL side Gold Coast Titans to join the club his father Brian coached between 1995 and 1996.
He has worked at a number of clubs including Penrith Panthers, Sydney Roosters and New Zealand Warriors, as well as being head coach of Tonga.
Smith replaces James Lowes, who stepped down in April for personal reasons.
"I've had a long affinity with the Bulls with my Dad and it was great to be a part of it watching on from the stands," Smith told the club website.
"I was fortunate enough to start coaching at a young age and my path has been a bit different to the path which most coaches take."
Bradford are currently third in the Championship, seven points behind leaders Leigh Centurions with a game in hand.
