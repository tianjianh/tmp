The offences took place between 2006 and 2012.
During a trial, lasting more than six weeks, jurors heard the girls were raped, abused and prostituted after meeting the Whiteley brothers and Spencer at Sheffield's former Castle Market.
Prosecutor Peter Hampton, said Christopher Whitely, 23, who was convicted of eight offences, would appear "charming" at first.
In relation to one victim, he said: "She believed that he was her friend, but over the weeks his attitude to her changed. He became aggressive and forceful. She was frightened of him."
He said a second girl, who was taken to up to 50 properties and forced to have sex with men for money, painted a similar picture of Spencer.
"She was friendly at first but that soon changed. She plied [the girl] with alcohol and began to prostitute her," he said.
"On each occasion she was fearful that Amanda Spencer would be violent towards her."
Bapir, who was convicted of rape, was among the men Spencer forced the girl to have sex with.
Spencer was previously convicted of 16 charges relating to child prostitution and jailed for 12 years.
After the trial Jayne Ludlam, from Sheffield City Council, praised the "bravery" of the victims.
She said: "It sends a clear message to anyone involved in the sexual exploitation of vulnerable young people - you will be identified, pursued and prosecuted."
