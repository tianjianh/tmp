The 23-year-old has been recovering from a shoulder injury after undergoing surgery in July.
Lee, who played in all three Tests for Wales in New Zealand in June, was expected to be sidelined for 12-16 weeks.
"He's looking good," said Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac.
"There's been consultation (with Wales) and everyone is happy with his testing.
"He's training with us today and he's stepping it up. He'll have more involvement next week."
Scarlets suffered a second successive Pro12 loss when they were beaten 20-9 by Edinburgh at Murrayfield on Friday.
The Welsh region visit Ulster on Friday, 16 September.
