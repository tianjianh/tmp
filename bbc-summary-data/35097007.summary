Wales income tax powers for better government, Crabb says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Welsh government cannot "duck and dive and avoid" responsibility for raising some of its budget through taxes, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb has said.

He said he told sceptics that devolving income tax powers would mean "better government for Wales".
Plans to devolve powers over 10p worth of income tax are underway.
The Welsh government said it was trying avoid "the range of traps on tax and powers laid by the UK government".
Chancellor George Osborne has said a referendum will no longer be needed for the power to be transferred.
"I think it's important we respect the right of the assembly to have flexibility about when the date will kick in for devolution to take affect," Mr Crabb said on Monday.
"But what they can't do is duck and dive and avoid the responsibility forever more.
"It's important that they step up to the plate, that they become a body that not just spends lots of taxpayers' money but also has responsibility for raising it and, as a result, becomes a more financially-accountable and responsible Welsh government.
Mr Crabb said he thought public opinion was "fluid" on the matter, but there were "very, very strong reasons for why we need to press ahead" for Wales and the Welsh economy to get stronger.
He added that he would "re-craft" the draft Wales Bill on the next stage of devolution in the new year.
It follows criticism from other parties that the proposals could result in Westminster taking back some of the powers it had given to the assembly.
Mr Crabb said he was "sensitive" to negative comments on the planned legislation.
"My job is to sit down now and work out how we re-craft it to strike the right balance between giving additional power to Cardiff, but also building in that clarity that is absolutely vital for Welsh devolution," he said.
A Welsh government spokesman said: "The only thing we are seeking to avoid is the range of traps on tax and powers, rather clumsily laid by the UK government.
"We are not going to lock in unfair funding, and we are not going to give an English veto on Welsh laws. Our positions on both matters are very straightforward.
"The UK government is ducking and diving about devolving air passenger duty.
"If they're so keen on responsibility why aren't they treating us in the same way as Scotland and allowing us to develop our airport?"
