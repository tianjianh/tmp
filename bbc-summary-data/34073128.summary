The expansion comes as Flybe launches its second 118-seat Embraer Jet at the airport in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan.
The 22 extra flights will increase journeys to Cork, Dublin, Dusseldorf, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Milan and Paris, while flights to and from Munich will depart five days a week.
Flybe has grown operations from Cardiff after opening a base there in June.
The airport's managing director Debra Barber said she was confident the airline would "continue to thrive" from the base.
