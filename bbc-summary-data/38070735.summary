SA Brain also revealed the first images of how its Cardiff brewery site might look when redeveloped.
The planned site will cover more than three million square feet and feature offices, hotels and apartments alongside a waterfront leisure zone.
The brewery's building and chimney will be kept in recognition of its heritage.
They will form a backdrop to the waterfront scheme, where water taxis and small private yachts will be able to moor.
Chief executive Scott Waddington said: "We recognise the brewery site has huge potential for redevelopment and at the same time we needed to re-invest in our brewing plant, office and training facilities.
"This presented the opportunity for us to relocate and enable the Central Quay development to take place."
He added: "While moving from our Crawshay Street home in the centre of Cardiff will be sad, I am excited by the potential the scheme creates for both our business and employees.
"We are also aware of numerous other brands that want a presence in Cardiff and believe Central Quay's waterfront location will drive huge investment from some of the national and international operators who want to be in Cardiff."
The project is a joint venture with Rightacres Property.
Rightacres chief executive Paul McCarthy said: "The timing for bringing forward the Brain's site ties in perfectly with the Metro system delivery programme.
"Public transport is pivotal to the success of any business district and to have a Metro terminal at Central Quay, adjacent to the central train station would be good for all concerned."
Rightacres will continue developing the masterplan over the next few months in consultation with Cardiff planners and other stakeholders in the 15-acre site to the south of the station.
Mr McCarthy said: "We would hope to submit detailed planning for our first buildings towards the middle of next year with a view to getting under way with construction towards the end of 2017."
Cardiff council leader Phil Bale said: "The city council has been involved in trying to unlock this opportunity for a number of years and we are delighted that Brains and Rightacres have come to an agreement which will help deliver on our aspirations to extend the city centre south of the train station."
Mr Waddington added: "We are looking at a number of different opportunities for the new brewery facility and hope to announce our final decision early in the new year."
