About £34m of extra funding will be invested in services over the next year, Welsh Water has announced.

The cash will help give lowest-earning households cheaper bills, replace ageing pipes and restore Cardiff and Lisvane reservoirs.
The not-for-profit company, which serves people in Wales and Herefordshire, invested an extra £32 million last year.
The plan follows a consultation with 12,000 customers.
In total, £5m will go to providing cheaper bills for low earners and £10m for replacing the pipe network in areas such as Anglesey and the Rhondda valley.
As part of a long-term plan to bring them back into use, £5m will help restore Cardiff's Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs.
Biodiversity and recreational access to Swiss Valley reservoir, Llanelli and Lliw reservoir, Felindre, Swansea, will also be improved.
Other work includes a new wastewater treatment works in Borth, Ceredigion, aimed at reducing flooding and replacing or cleansing 108 miles (174 km) of pipes to Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
Chief executive Chris Jones said: "We know our customers have high expectations of the services we provide.
"At the same time they want us to protect and enhance the world around us and keep bills affordable. We are proud that we have continued to achieve this balance over the past 12 months."
