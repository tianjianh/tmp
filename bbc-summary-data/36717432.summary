[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belle Vue Nursing Home in Middlesbrough in special measures over 'neglect'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Middlesbrough care home has been placed in special measures over concerns its residents had suffered from neglect.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Belle Vue Nursing Home was judged to be "inadequate" by the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) after an unannounced inspection in May.
It was ordered to improve but, after further complaints, was visited again in June and found to be "inadequate".
If it does not improve steps will be taken to close it down, the CQC said.
At the time of the latest inspection, the home - which has three units - was caring for 60 people with dementia and young disabled adults.
It was told that failing to report deaths and serious injuries was a breach of CQC rules.
Staff then began sending notifications to the CQC, which concluded: "We identified occasions when people had died unexpectedly or been injured.
"We were concerned that the information indicated that the home may have neglected people's care and treatment needs."
Inspectors also found residents' weights were not being monitored, running the risk of them becoming malnourished.
The CQC also found medication was not being administered "in line with prescriptions".
Its report concluded that if the home was found to be inadequate when next inspected, steps would be taken to prevent it "operating".
