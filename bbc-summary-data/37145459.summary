Fulham boss Slavisa Jokanovic has criticised the club's transfer policy, declaring he is "not an important person" in their recruitment process.

The Serb told BBC Radio London that Craig Kline, a data analyst at the west London club, is ultimately responsible for signings.
"It generally depends on this guy [Kline] who is going to sign for us or not," Jokanovic, 48, said.
"The last decision is in the hands of this man. It is not my business."
Kline was brought to the Whites by Tony Khan, the son of the club's American owner Shahid, and has introduced statistical data to the club's recruitment.
Chief football officer Mike Rigg also has an input to transfer dealings at the Championship club.
"I'm a little bit disappointed because no one knows who this guy [Kline] is," Jokanovic added.
"Instead he's sitting in the directors box.
"I want to take responsibility for how I work with my team and how they perform but I am not part of the recruitment business. It is in the hands of people who believe they're more prepared."
Fulham have signed nine players this summer but sold striker Ross McCormack to Aston Villa for a fee of Â£12m on the eve of the campaign.
Jokanovic is keen to use that money to strengthen his squad but claims he has missed out on signing new players because of Kline.
"It is better to ask questions to this man as he can explain what we are going to do in recruitment," Jokanovic said.
"I've lost many players in this process in nine months. In the last two days I lost a few players who he believes are not good enough.
"I had an opinion from one of the best managers in the world on one of the players and he believes it is a good signing for us and I believe that too. Craig doesn't believe it is a good signing for us and this guy is not with us."
