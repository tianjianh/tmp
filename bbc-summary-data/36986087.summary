BBC reporter Amy Woodfield, who recorded the footage as a passenger in another car, said: "I don't know what caused the drama. He was furious.
"He was possibly a pedestrian or running because he was in running gear.
"He started approaching other cars as well and I started to get a bit scared that he might jump on our car.
"You could see the blood dripping from his hand and knee and he was grinning as he was walking around."
The force said the arrested man remained in police custody.
