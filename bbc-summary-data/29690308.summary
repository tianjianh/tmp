Ben Hall suicide: IoM government accepts hospital 'failures'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Manx government has apologised for the "gross systemic failures" of a psychiatric hospital which led to the death of a mental health patient.

Ben Hall, 25, from Port Erin was found hanged in his bathroom on a ward at Grianagh Court in Braddan in June 2012.
Coroner John Needham said his suicide could have been avoided had the hospital fitted a collapsible shower rail.
Unsafe rails at the hospital have since been replaced, said a spokesman.
In an inquest hearing last week, Mr Needham added: "This amounted to a gross systemic failure in the basic care provided to Ben".
"I have considered the systemic failures that led to this tragedy and I have also considered the steps that have been taken to prevent similar tragedies happening in the future.
"I do note the large number of steps that the organisation has taken to change the various systems that failed in this case. All en suite bathrooms on the acute adult ward now have collapsible shower rails".
The special rails, recommended by the chief medical officer in 2000, are designed to fall if a weight of 40kg (90lb) is suspended anywhere along their entire length.
The government said: "The department of health and social care wishes to express its condolences to Mr Hall's family and friends following the conclusion of the inquest into his death.  The department accepts the Coroner's verdict and recommendation.
"Following Mr Hall's death the department undertook an immediate and comprehensive review of the incident and implemented a number of measures in response.
"The department will now urgently address the coroner's recommendations to determine whether there are any additional measures that were not contained within the department's own action plan".
