Whitchurch teacher banned after sexual affair with student

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A science teacher has been banned from the profession for life after having a sexual relationship with a student.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A panel heard Keith John Wright had a relationship with a year 11 student at Testbourne Community School, Whitchurch between 2000 and 2001.
Mr Wright, from Whitchurch, Hampshire, was also found to have taken another pupil to a pub to meet with his friend.
The 50-year-old, who denied all allegations, has been banned from teaching indefinitely.
Mr Wright was acquitted of indecent assault charges following a trial at Winchester Crown Court in April 2014.
The professional hearing, carried out by the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), found him guilty of sexually motivated behaviour with both pupils.
It heard how the relationship with a girl referred to as Pupil A, was not reported to police until March 2013 - thirteen years after it was said to have taken place.
The panel concluded the Pupil A's academic progress and fulfilment had been prejudiced by Mr Wright's conduct and that it was the girl's belief that, having been distracted by him during her GCSE year, she failed to meet her potential.
The panel found that Mr Wright's behaviour in conducting a sexual relationship with Pupil A was "wholly incompatible with being a teacher".
The prohibition order prevents him from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children's home in England indefinitely.
He can not apply for the order to be lifted.
