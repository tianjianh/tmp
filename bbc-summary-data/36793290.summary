The incident happened on the road between Crimond and St Fergus at about 21:00 on Tuesday.

Police Scotland said a 21-year-old man had been charged and would be reported to the procurator fiscal.
PC Tom Allan, who is investigating the incident, said: "We are appealing for members of the public who were in the area at the time to come forward with information they may have.
"A number of other vehicles were on the road at the time of the incident and we are particularly keen to speak with the drivers of a white car travelling northbound and a dark, possibly burgundy, hatchback that was travelling southbound."
