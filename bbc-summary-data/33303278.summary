The 27-year-old was attacked after being approached by a man at about 03:45.
She had left a bus on Lauder Road and was forced into a wooded area between Lauder Road and Wester Kippielaw Drive.
Detectives are investigating reports that the man involved was earlier thrown out of a local nightclub.
He was described as white, aged about 20, approximately 5ft 7in tall, and of a very slim build.
He had short dark hair and was wearing tight-fitted jeans and a shiny black hooded top.
'Horrendous ordeal'
Police also want to speak to two men seen walking along Lauder Road towards Mayfield.
The first man was described as being of a heavy build and wearing a dark jacket with light-coloured jeans.
The second man, who was walking on the opposite side of the road, was wearing a dark coloured top with a white motif on his chest.
Det Sgt Alistair Sellar said: "This was an horrendous ordeal for a woman to go through and we are very keen to trace the suspect as quickly as possible.
"A full investigation into this incident is now under way and I would like to reassure the local community that officers are doing everything they can to ensure this man is found.
"He may be local to the area and there is information to suggest that he attended a nightclub prior to the attack.
"However, we need the assistance of the public who may hold vital information to assist with our ongoing inquiries."
