Consultation on £20m Aberdeen Union Terrace Gardens plan closing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 1,000 people have given their views on plans for a £20m revitalisation of a historic Aberdeen city centre park as a consultation draws to a close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The online survey into the proposals for Union Terrace Gardens (UTG) was launched a week ago.
LDA Design said the aim - including new access from surrounding streets - was to make UTG a "lively cultural hub".
The consultation closes at the end of Friday.
A report on the consultation is expected to go to full council in March next year. If approved, the target completion date is the autumn of 2019.
Four years ago, councillors rejected plans for a £140m transformation of the gardens.
Businessman Sir Ian Wood had offered £50m towards the cost.
New access would be from Union Street and Union Terrace at the existing Burns Monument. The central lawn space would be retained, and there would be a new café pavilion opposite His Majesty's Theatre (HMT).
