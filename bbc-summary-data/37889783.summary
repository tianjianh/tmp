A gunman opened fire on a crowd watching an English Premier League game near the town of Juba.
South Sudan's National Courier newspaper said the gunman had escaped despite a "prompt response" from security forces.
Police are investigating, but have not yet identified a motive.
The incident took place in Gure, a suburb of Juba, the South Sudan capital.
The city was hit by violence earlier this year as rival political factions clashed, prompting the vice-president, Riek Machar, to flee the country.
