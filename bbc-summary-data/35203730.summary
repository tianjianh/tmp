Australia rains cause rare filling of massive desert lake

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heavy rains have started to fill Australia's vast Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre and are bringing the desert to life.

Pictures captured by pilot Trevor Wright show water filling dry salt plains that lie 700km (435 miles) north of Adelaide.
The area around the lake has been inundated with rain over the last week, with falls of over 150mm reported.
Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre fills only a few times in a century. When this happens it is Australia's largest lake.
Subsequent rainfall both around the lake and in its vast catchment will determine how large the lake becomes this year.
Rivers that flow from south-west and central Queensland are expected to bring water to the lake over the coming months.
The lake's spectacular bird life is a major tourist draw and the area even has its own yacht club that holds regattas when the water is deep enough.
