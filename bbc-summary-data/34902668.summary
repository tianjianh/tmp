Elliot Lord wants to see his beds given to street sleepers and refugees across the country. So far about 12 beds have been handed out in Wolverhampton.
Mr Lord, of Our Own Future project, said: "I wanted to do something for homeless people who have a lack of opportunities and support."
The beds are made from interlocking pieces of strong card.
The bed had been well-received by homeless people who trialled it in Wolverhampton, he said.
"They basically said it was the best sleep they had ever had on the streets and they didn't have the pain from sleeping on the ground," he said.
Birmingham University students who assembled the beds in a workshop also backed the design.
Chemical engineering student Nigel Chow said they were "really comfortable and stable".
"It's actually quite innovative to be able to turn this cardboard around that people would throw out and turn that into things people can really use and really benefit the homeless," he said.
Student Paymann Tahamtan said cutting the card had been "relatively difficult" but the bed was "wonderfully made".
Mr Lord hopes a permanent workshop where homeless people could collect beds will be set up.
