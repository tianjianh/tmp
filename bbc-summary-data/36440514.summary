Ali, 74, is being treated by doctors as a precaution and is described as being in a "fair condition". A brief hospital stay is expected.
Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1984, after quitting boxing.
The three-time world champion was last hospitalised in January 2015 following a severe urinary tract infection.
Family spokesman Bob Gunnell confirmed Ali's condition to the Associated Press but did not divulge which hospital was treating him or when he was admitted.
