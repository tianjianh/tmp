West leaders start work on bid for more powers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol's mayor and the leaders of three neighbouring councils are to review how they work together, in a bid to get more powers from the government.

They hope to capitalise on Chancellor George Osborne's offer to devolve more political and spending powers.
In Greater Manchester, a deal was dependent on the city agreeing to have an elected "metro mayor".
But local Labour and Conservative politicians have expressed doubts about the idea of a mayor for the region.
Mr Osborne said last year that "no model of local power will be the same".
Bristol's independent mayor George Ferguson met the leaders of Bath and North East Somerset, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire councils last week to discuss how they could bid for more powers.
In a joint statement, they said: "We agree today to undertake a review of governance on how we strengthen our joint working as four unitary authorities, with a view to obtaining devolved powers from the government for the benefit of all our residents."
The review is expected to take up to 18 months.
The focus on the "northern powerhouse" idea has prompted some debate locally about how a "western powerhouse" might take shape.
Somerset County Council leader John Osman, a Conservative, is convening a meeting of all south west council leaders on 5 August to discuss the issue.
Labour councillors on four councils have already said they will fight any plans for a "metro mayor" while Tim Warren, the Conservative leader of Bath and North East Somerset, has said he was not keen on the idea either.
