The blaze broke out in Wilmslow Road, underneath runway one, at about 18:00 GMT Cheshire Police said.
Photos from the scene show plumes of smoke billowing out of the underpass.
An airport spokeswoman said all flights had been diverted to runway two as a precaution and she believes it will be back to normal soon.
Some planes are delayed and passengers should check the status of their flight with their airline, she added.
Passengers have reported being stuck at foreign airports as a result, while others said their flights had been diverted to Liverpool and Birmingham.
Adam Harrington has tweeted: "Fire at Manchester airport so sat on a runway in Alicante for an hour and a half."
