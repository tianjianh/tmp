Tickets for a new lottery to benefit charities and voluntary groups in Portsmouth have gone on sale.

The city council, which set up the lottery, said it will provide "sustainable" income for good causes which may lose out from funding cuts.
Of the £1 ticket price, 60% will go to local causes with the rest divided between the prize fund and running costs.
More than 50 groups have so far applied to receive a share of the funds.
The first weekly draw is due to take place on 5 November with a jackpot fixed at £25,000. Unlike the National Lottery, there is no rollover.
A council spokeswoman said the eight week run-up to the first draw is to promote the scheme.
Groups which have already registered an interest in lottery funding include the city's deaf association, Portsmouth Autism Support Network, the Samaritans and Hilsea Lido as well as scouts and brownies, football and rugby teams.
The lottery is run on behalf of the council by external provider Gatherwell which already runs a similar scheme for Aylesbury Vale District Council.
Portsmouth City Council leader, Donna Jones, said using an external company would "mitigate any risk" to the council.
