Matthew Brown, 38, later told the head teacher of Ysgol Maelgwn, Llandudno Junction, he did it as a joke but realised he had acted foolishly.
An Education Workforce Council hearing in Ewloe found two allegations of unprofessional conduct proved.
Mr Brown did not appear at the hearing on Thursday but denied acting unprofessionally.
He was reprimanded for a "lapse in his professional judgement", which would stay on his record for a year but Mr Brown has already de-registered as a teacher.
Gisella Williams, head teacher at the time, said Mr Brown was a well-liked supply teacher at the primary school for a number of years, teaching a class of seven and eight-year-olds.
Miss Williams said the father of "Pupil A" had visited her at the school in July 2015.
"The father said Pupil A was extremely reluctant to attend school that day," she said.
The pupil, wearing shorts, had been upset by what happened.
Miss Williams said she was shocked and Mr Brown appeared very remorseful when she confronted him.
"I felt Matthew Brown's conduct was unprofessional and foolish. I don't think he was setting a good example for the children," she said.
"I don't think Mr Brown thought about his actions or thought about the consequences for his career."
She added she had not had any previous concerns about his work.
An allegation Mr Brown, who was covering maternity leave, Sellotaped Pupil A's hands to a desk was also found proved.
But an allegation he had taped the hand of a girl to a ball was not proved as misconduct.
