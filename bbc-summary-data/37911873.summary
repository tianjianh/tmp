Lukas Jutkiewicz: Burnley's on-loan striker may remain with Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City's on-loan Burnley striker Lukas Jutkiewicz is happy to make his move to St Andrew's more permanent after rediscovering his goal touch with the Championship club.

After more than two years without a goal, the 27-year-old has now scored five times in 11 appearances.
"For me, it's just brilliant to be playing again," he told BBC WM.
"The manager (Gary Rowett) has been good in indicating he is particularly keen to make it permanent."
He added: "I'm not 100% sure what the ins and outs of this so-called option are.
"But it has been noted that the international break is the time for people to sit down and talk about situations."
Southampton-born Jutkiewicz, who has three times commanded a seven-figure fee in his 10-year professional career - for Everton, Middlesbrough and Burnley - was joining his 10th club when he came to St Andrew's.
Prior to coming to the West Midlands on 31 August, Jutkiewicz had gone more than two years without scoring a goal.
In fact, his last goal, on loan from Middlesbrough to Bolton Wanderers in May 2014, was the one that almost sent Blues down to League One, but for an injury-time Paul Caddis equaliser.
"First year in the Premier League with Burnley, I didn't play many games and almost the whole of last season I spent on the sidelines injured.
"I'm quite a cerebral person in my spare time and you do analyse things when you're sidelined. Maybe sometimes you over-analyse things. But I knew, if I could play regularly, everything would fall into place.
"If you have a right mind, it can only benefit you on the pitch. From my point of view, I just wanted to go and play football and let the rest sort itself out. And the lads have made it very easy for me to fit in.
"I've had a few bumps and bruises, but, for any centre-forwards or centre-half, that's what you get in a physical league like this when you put your body on the line. And I just take it on the chin."
