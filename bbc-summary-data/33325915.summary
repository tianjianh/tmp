The list of top 10 influencers featured women from the worlds of politics, fashion, journalism, business and entertainment.
The judging panel described the SNP leader as "the woman of the moment".
She was chosen ahead of Anna Wintour, editor-in-chief of American Vogue, and actor, director and humanitarian ambassador Angelina Jolie.
The others in the top 10 included Guardian editor Kath Viner, Downing Street policy unit director Camilla Cavendish and singer Sia.
Caitlyn Jenner also featured on the list for "the part she has played in bringing the experience of being a trans woman to a global audience".
The organisers said the aim had been to identify a range of women who had an "exceptionally large impact" on people's lives through their ability to influence others.
Journalist and broadcaster Emma Barnett, who chaired the judging panel, said: "Those who influence usually have the ear of the traditionally powerful - but are one step removed.
"Sometimes, as in the case of Nicola Sturgeon, they will be both the power broker and the influencer.
"But most of the women in our list are the key influencers behind the most influential people's decisions, from Camilla Cavendish whispering policy suggestions in to David Cameron's ear to Sia deciding what tunes Beyonce and Rihanna belt out on their next respective albums."
She said Ms Sturgeon had "huge power" as the leader of the SNP.
"But she also wields a huge amount of influence right now because of the state of both the UK union and the European one.
"Ahead of the in-out referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, how she chooses to wield that influence over the public and her fellow political leaders could have potentially huge ramifications for this country.
"She is the woman of the moment in terms of influence and hard power."
