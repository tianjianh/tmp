As part of the £3m Environment Agency scheme, a 115ft (35m) section of the road was raised by about half a metre.
The agency apologised for any inconvenience during the "vital work".
When it closed on 8 June, the bridge had only been opened for three months following a £4m revamp which had put it out of action from August 2013.
The most recent impact of flooding in Port Clarence was in December 2013, when a tidal surge combined with high spring tides affected about 50 homes and businesses. .
Project Manager Chris Milburn said: "The road raising was a vital element of the overall scheme.
"We've completed that aspect of the work and the Transporter Bridge is now open.
"We worked hard to keep disruption to a minimum and would like to thank residents for their patience."
