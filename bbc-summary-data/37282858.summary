[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reece Thompson's second-half goal handed North Ferriby their first ever away win in the fifth tier as they beat struggling Gateshead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Although it was goalless at the break, the Villagers responded to four defeats in-a-row by taking the game to the hosts.
Thompson shot just wide from Taron Hare's cross, and Danny Clarke forced Sam Johnson into a good save.
It was no surprise when Thompson gave North Ferriby the advantage in the 49th minute. The deadline-day signing marked his first goal for the Grange Lane club by rounding the goalkeeper and slotting in from a tight angle.
Gus Mafuta's late strike almost levelled the scores, but North Ferriby held on for the win.
