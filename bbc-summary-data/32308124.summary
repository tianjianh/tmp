Election 2015: Big issues affecting young voters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
What are the big issues affecting young voters across Wales?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That is the question I have been exploring since the start of the election campaign.
And, as we count down the days to #GE2015, we are stepping up our coverage for young people.
We will be taking your questions to the people behind the manifestos and asking them about the issues you tell us you feel most passionate about - your career, your cash, your future.
The BBC bosses have decided to give me my own Facebook page to post snippets of election news and views from young voters across Wales.
And using the hashtag #iNeverKnew, we will be sharing election facts and getting your questions answered.
From 20 April, BBC Wales will be on an election tour - visiting six key places where there are interesting battles going on between the different parties fighting for your vote.
We will be stopping at Barry, Carmarthen, Tregaron, Llandudno, Connah's Quay and Cardiff.
If you have not seen it yet - check out our giant inflatable tent that we will be taking with us.
I will be running some sessions in the tent from 12:00-13:00 BST at each stop on the tour, so come along if you can.
BBC Wales' The Wales Report will also be hosting a special election debate programme for young voters on 29 April, hosted by Radio 1's Huw Stephens.
They are looking for young people to be in the audience. Here is how to apply.
In the meantime, you can find out more about what each of the main political parties are promising to do if they win the election here.
