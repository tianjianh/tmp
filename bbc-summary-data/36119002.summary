[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Athletic secured promotion straight back to the Championship with a win at struggling Blackpool that edged the Seasiders closer to the drop.

After a goalless first half, Wigan went ahead through Chris McCann, who then turned provider for Yanic Wildschut to double the Latics' lead on the counter.
Wildschut then slotted in the third before Will Grigg headed in a fourth.
Blackpool remain two points adrift with one match to play and will be relegated if Fleetwood win at Walsall on Monday.
Wigan, who have lost just once since being beaten at home by Blackpool on 12 December, are now also all-but champions, having a three-point lead at the top and a significantly superior goal difference compared to second-placed Burton Albion.
Blackpool, who were relegated from the Premier League in 2011 on a final day that saw Wigan extend their stay in the top flight, are now staring at the fourth tier of English football.
Even if Fleetwood lose on Monday, Blackpool must beat Peterborough away on the final day to have any hope of avoiding a second successive relegation.
The home fans protested against the club's owners before kick-off and it was the 3,000 travelling Wigan fans who left Bloomfield Road in celebration.
The Latics, who like Blackpool suffered relegation from the Championship one year ago, have won seven of their last nine games to ensure their immediate return to the second tier.
Wigan manager Gary Caldwell told BBC Radio Manchester: "We'll enjoy tonight and then look forward to a massive party next Sunday, back at the DW Stadium.
"It's for the whole football club. As manager I understand the whole club and what it means to so many people.
"We want to work hard in the summer and, if everyone does that, I'm sure we'll be a difficult team to play against next year."
