Exorcist to have UK stage premiere

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The stage version of supernatural shocker The Exorcist is to have its UK premiere around Halloween.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Pielmeier's play, about a young girl possessed by the devil, will run at Birmingham Rep from 21 October to 5 November.
The play is based on William Peter Blatty's 1971 novel that also spawned the 1973 film starring Max von Sydow.
Audiences will be warned it "contains adult material which may shock and offend".
The age recommendation is 18+.
Pielmeier's play had its world premiere in 2012 at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles with a cast that included Brooke Shields as the possessed girl's mother and Richard Chamberlain as the demon-battling priest.
Running alongside The Exorcist at The Rep is Seance by Glen Neath and David Rosenberg (18-29 October) - a 15-minute "immersive performance" that takes place in absolute darkness inside a shipping container outside the theatre in Centenary Square.
The Rep's autumn and winter season opens in September with a "stylish contemporary spin" on Oscar Wilde's classic The Importance of Being Earnest.
