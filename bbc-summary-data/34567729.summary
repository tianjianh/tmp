Reading Women face a winter of hard work as they prepare for life in Women's Super League One, according to boss Kelly Chambers.

The Royals clinched the WSL 2 title on Sunday with a 3-2 win over Aston Villa.
"There will be a restructuring at the club, going full-time," Chambers told BBC Sport. "Then it's a case of sitting down and talking with the players.
"They won't get that long off. They think they might, but they're back in before Christmas, and we go again."
Reading and second-placed Doncaster Rovers Belles had already sealed promotion to the top flight, but Chambers' side held on to top spot on the final day on goal difference.
It was confirmed on Sunday that both clubs have officially met the Football Association's criteria to join the top tier.
"It is a fantastic feeling," Chambers added. "I've known the girls have been able to do it since the start of the season.
"I've been here from the start, since 2006. It's been a rollercoaster. The club are fully behind us. They want us to grow."
Royals captain Kirsty McGee added: "Our togetherness has won us the league this year.
"I'm sure Kelly and the staff are going to strengthen the squad, and we're only going to go on and do better and bigger things now."
Harriet Scott, who scored Reading's opening goal against Villa, added: "I've been with the club since I was 12.
"Promotion was the best thing that ever happened to this club, and this is just the cherry on the top."
Belles boss Glen Harris started his side's final game with four strikers on the field, in an attempt to overturn Reading's superior goal difference.
"I think there's a tinge of disappointment with the players," he told BBC Sport after the Belles' 4-0 win over Millwall Lionesses. "We didn't quite get enough goals.
"But I can't fault the girls today. We're nine games unbeaten in the league now so it gives us momentum to go on for next season.
"We want Belles back where we believe they belong. Once the girls get over this, they'll realise their achievement."
