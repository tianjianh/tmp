Swansea's biggest nightclub is to close at the weekend due to a fall in customer numbers.

The club's owners Luminar Group said the Oceana's position away from the main city centre nightlife meant attracting customers was a challenge.
But the firm said it was exploring other options to remain in the city.
The 3,000-capacity club was saved in 2011 by a group of investors when the old Luminar went into administration.
A statement from its owners said: "We will close this weekend whilst we consider plans for the future.
"We have consulted with our team and would like to thank our employees and our customers for their loyalty over the years.
"This has not been an easy decision, the management team has been involved with the club since it opened over 30 years ago but its location at the end of the Kingsway has proved too much of a challenge to attract the necessary footfall."
News of Oceana's struggle was highlighted in a documentary for Channel 4 back in 2012.
The venue has been used as a double-room nightclub for many years.
It was formerly known as Ritzy and Icon in the 1990s and later Time and Envy, and was seen as the main night spot in Swansea city centre.
It closed in 2008 for a Â£6m refurbishment and opened up with an extra five theme bars, making it the biggest Oceana in Wales and one of the largest in the UK.
