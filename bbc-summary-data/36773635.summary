The United Airlines flight 929 from London Heathrow made the diversion after it began leaking fuel.
The Boeing 767-300 aircraft, which left London at 07:02, landed at Edinburgh just before 10:00 after circling above Scotland dumping fuel.
Officials said "all 119 passengers and 11 crew are safe and well". Other flights in and out of Edinburgh Airport were unaffected by the emergency.
Contingency plans are being put in place for the passengers who were heading to Chicago to continue their journey.
A United Airlines spokesman said: "Our customer service team at Edinburgh Airport is providing assistance to customers of flight UA929 (London/Heathrow-Chicago) today, which diverted to Edinburgh because of a mechanical issue.
"The aircraft landed safely at 09:45 (local time). We apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused."
