It's safe to say Ed Sheeran's got some pretty big achievements under his 23-year-old belt.
But now the singer has announced plans for his biggest solo concert to date at Wembley Stadium on 10 July 2015.
He said: "I've made no secret recently of my ambition to play Wembley Stadium on my own in front of 80,000 people.
"I am absolutely over the moon to be able to announce it's going to happen next summer. It's going to be amazing, I just can't wait."
The show will be part of his Multiply world tour and follows his 21 sold out shows in the UK earlier this year.
Thinking Out Loud became Ed Sheeran's second UK number one single in July, after Sing topped the chart in June.
Both tracks are taken from the singer's second number one album X, pronounced Multiply, which spent eight weeks at the top of the UK chart.
It also went to number one in the US and across Europe and has sold over three million copies worldwide to date.
Tickets for Ed Sheeran's show at Wembley Stadium will go on sale on 26 November.
