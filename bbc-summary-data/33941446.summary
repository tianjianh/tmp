Mark Drakeford supports Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn's bid to become Labour leader has won support from Wales' Health Minister Mark Drakeford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Drakeford is the fourth AM to publically back Mr Corbyn saying he was the candidate "whose views most closely reflect my own".
Fellow ministers Vaughan Gething and Ken Skates support Andy Burnham and Leighton Andrews has said he is backing Yvette Cooper.
No AMs have publicly come out in support of Liz Kendall.
Mr Andrews is the only other Welsh government cabinet member to publically declare his voting intentions.
The other AMs to publically support Mr Corbyn are Mike Hedges, Mick Antoniw and Christine Chapman.
The public statement came after David Llewellyn Davies, Chair of Cardiff West Constituency Labour Party wrote to Mr Drakeford, asking him to declare his position.
In the letter, published on Mr Drakeford's website, he wrote: "I had understood that the first minister felt his cabinet colleagues were best remaining neutral at least from a public perspective.
"I wonder given Leighton's intervention if you would now like to do the same?"
In his response to Mr Davies, also published on his website, Mr Drakeford said he had decided to support Mr Corbyn after meeting him in Cardiff in the early days of the Labour leadership campaign.
He added he had been "reluctant" to make any public statement because until Mr Andrews came out in support of Ms Cooper no cabinet member in the Welsh government had declared their support for any candidate.
He said he wanted a Labour Party "uncompromising in challenging the Tory myth that there is no alternative to austerity economics".
