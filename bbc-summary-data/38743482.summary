New staff have been drafted in by NHS Grampian amid concern about surgery being cancelled because of a lack of theatre nurses.

It was revealed at the start of the year that well over 100 procedures had been cancelled across the north east since the beginning of November.
By the middle of January, 29 procedures in Aberdeen had been affected out of a schedule of 458.
NHS Grampian said the new staff would be on rota from March.
Some hospital theatres are not being used due to operations being cancelled.
It is understood further operations in February are expected to be postponed.
The health board said investment was also being made in a theatre practitioner development programme.
NHS Grampian added that recruitment was not the only issue.
A spokeswoman said: "We have employed seven newly qualified practitioners and anticipate they will be able to take part in the rota from March onwards.
"It must be noted that this is not solely a staffing issue.
"We have seen some extremely ill patients both during and after the festive period. This has placed pressure on our critical care services.
"If we cannot guarantee the availability of appropriate post-operative care we will not proceed with operations.
"Patient safety is of paramount importance to us."
