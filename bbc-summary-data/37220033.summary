[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire County Cricket Club is mourning the loss of one of its most faithful servants - supporters association chairman Ken Mills MBE.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Mills died following a long battle against cancer.
The 77-year-old was Worcestershire County Cricket Supporters Association (WCCSA) chairman for 41 years, having officially taken on the role in 1975.
His work was supported by his wife Pat, who was secretary for more than 40 years until her death in April 2014.
The association has raised close to an estimated Â£7m in the 65 years since being formed in 1951.
Mills was only the third chairman in its history.
Prior to that, he had already contracted bone cancer, which he fought for a decade while carrying on his duties as both WCCSA chairman and treasurer.
Mills was awarded an MBE for his services to the association.
All 18 first-class counties, just like any fan-owned football club or many grassroots sporting organisations, owe a debt of gratitude to the hours of unpaid service put in by faithful followers.
But the WCCSA has proved more successful than most, relying largely on membership payments, donations and its successful club shop.
This has helped fund improvements to facilities all over the 120-year-old county ground at New Road.
The Ladies Pavilion, the New Road Stand, the old Diglis End scoreboard, the players' dressing rooms attached to the old Pavilion, and the press box were among the many things paid for from the funds.
Director of Cricket Steve Rhodes said Mills had been an "amazing person."
"When you look around the ground, the amount of contributions the Supporters' Association - and Ken - has played a role in have helped the club is many fold," he said.
