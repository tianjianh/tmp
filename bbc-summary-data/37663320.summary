[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol City 1-0 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aaron Wilbraham struck late on as Bristol City edged past Blackburn Rovers at Ashton Gate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The veteran striker, 37, ran on to a long clearance and steered a shot past keeper Jason Steele in the 88th minute.
Rovers' Ben Marshall had the only effort on target in the first half, a free-kick that went straight at home keeper Frank Fielding.
Chances continued to be at a premium after the break until Wilbraham secured City's fifth home win of the season.
The home fans stood in tribute to the late Gerry Gow in the 64th minute, and were on their feet again when their penalty appeals were turned down after Scott Golbourne's shot appeared to hit Darragh Lenihan's arm.
Marvin Emnes saw a shot blocked as Rovers slid to a fifth away league defeat of the season.
City, who have now won four of their last six games, move above Birmingham into the play-off spots in sixth, while Blackburn drop back into the bottom three.
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson:
"It was a tough game for us. I consider Blackburn to be in a false position and they will be very disappointed not to have taken something.
"I was happy to reach half-time not one or two goals behind. But we were more like ourselves in the second half and deserved the bit of luck with the goal.
"Blackburn had blocked a lot of our shots and by the law of averages a deflection was due to go our way."
Blackburn Rovers manager Owen Coyle:
"I am gutted for the players and our travelling supporters. A performance like that would normally earn you three points, let alone one.
"We should have been ahead at half-time and my only concern is the small errors that can make all the difference in a close game.
"The goal came from our corner and one long ball forward after we concede a free-kick. We should have defended the situation better, but it was still an unfortunate deflection.
"I can't recall Jason Steele having to make a difficult save. The level of performance was so high and it's a huge disappointment to come away with nothing."
