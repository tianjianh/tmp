The deaths of two children killed by toxic gas fumes while on holiday in Corfu are to be reinvestigated.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christi and Bobby Shepherd died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a hotel booked through Thomas Cook in 2006.
An inquest into their deaths last month ruled the pair were unlawfully killed and the tour operator had breached its duty of care.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it will now re-examine evidence in the case.
Thomas Cook said it "fully supported" the review.
Christi, 7, and Bobby, 6, from Horbury, West Yorkshire, were on holiday with their father Neil Shepherd and his now wife, Ruth, when they died.
An inquest at Wakefield Coroner's Court heard they were poisoned by a faulty gas boiler at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel, which was attached to the side of the bungalow where the family were staying.
A criminal trial held in Greece in 2010 cleared Thomas Cook of any responsibility but found the hotel's manager and two members of staff guilty of manslaughter by negligence.
A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: "'We fully support the review by the CPS, which was entirely expected once the coroner directed the jury to return a finding of unlawful killing, in order to be consistent with the Greek convictions of manslaughter of the hotel employees in 2010.
"We will continue to co-operate with the CPS as we have done at all times since 2006."
