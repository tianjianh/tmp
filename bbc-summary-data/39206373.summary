Nottingham Forest caretaker boss Gary Brazil says Chris Cohen and Armand Traore must be carefully managed as they return to fitness after injury.

Both played in Saturday's win over Brighton after recovering from groin and knee problems respectively but were rested for Tuesday's loss to Brentford.
Brazil said the duo would be available to face Burton Albion on Saturday.
"Both have had a long time out and it's very hard to play twice in four days," Brazil told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"We cannot afford to let them play again and then break down for four weeks.
"We cannot lose players of that quality for four to five weeks with a soft tissue injury because they have both been out for so long."
Meanwhile, Brazil said his side lacked "energy" in the 3-2 home defeat against the Bees which leaves Forest just five points above the Championship relegation zone.
"We gave them room and they played," he added. "No excuses. Some of their football was excellent but we helped them.
"We came out second best in too many battles. We have learnt a lot - some of quite painful. We will dust ourselves down."
