Ark Housing Association fined after death of man in bath scalding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A housing association has been fined £75,000 following the death of a disabled man who was scalded in a bath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Hobbin, 60, was a resident of Kennedy Court in Haddington, which was owned by Ark Housing Association.
While a bath was being run, Mr Hobbin's legs slipped out of a bath chair and went into the water - probably due to an epileptic fit.
The housing association pleaded guilty to two contraventions of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
It was fined at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
The presiding sheriff ruled that Mr Hobbin suffered "catastrophic injuries" due to the mishap in June 2013, from which he died two weeks later.
Sheriff Norman McFadyen said the Ark Housing Association had a "blind spot" over its failure to adequately assess the risks of scalding a person in their care.
Sheriff McFadyen added: "It is often said that an accident was waiting to happen.
"Given the lack of systems, training and equipment, it is indeed surprising in this case that there had not been a previous incident.
"Noting as I do the care with which various aspects of risk had been assessed and addressed, it seems all the more puzzling that only the most cursory mention was made in the company's risk assessment material of the need to check that water was not too hot and that nothing was said about how that was to be done."
He added: "Any parent of young children - and indeed most parents-to-be - will be only too aware that testing temperature by pinkie finger-tip at the tap end is not going to give a reliable indication of the warmth of water in a deep bath.
"In this case, the bath was estimated to be three-quarters full. And, indeed, it appears that the support worker did have concerns that the water might be too hot."
In setting his fine at £75,000, Sheriff McFadyen acknowledged that Ark Housing Association had taken "swift remedial action" to prevent another accident and has co-operated fully with investigators. The firm has turned over more than £19m in each of the last two financial years.
Jane Gray, chief executive of Ark Housing Association, said: "This was a tragic accident which we deeply regret.  ARK has been honest and open, and admitted liability.
"We were glad to hear the Crown Fiscal note in court that ARK has co-operated fully with the Health and Safety Executive's investigation and that we took immediate remedial steps to ensure there could be no risk of such an incident occurring again.  These steps included installing Thermostatic Mixer Valves where necessary, providing thermometers, training staff and implementing written instructions for bathing and showering.
"Our deepest sympathies once again go out to Joseph's family and friends."
