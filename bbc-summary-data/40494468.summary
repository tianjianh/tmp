Mamo, 23, scored 12 tries in just nine Super League appearances this year after joining from Newcastle Knights.
The Australian had been expected to be out for a maximum of six weeks.
"The initial scans were a bit clouded because of the swelling. It's a 16-20 week injury," coach Rick Stone told BBC Radio Leeds.
