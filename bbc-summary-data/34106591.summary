[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Five men who shouted and sang offensive songs while drinking on a train from Glasgow to Oban are being sought by British Transport Police (BTP).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It happened on the 16:37 service from Glasgow Queen Street on Saturday.
The men are described as being in their late 30s. One had a shaved head, another was wearing a white t-shirt and one of them had a moustache.
BTP appealed for help in tracing the men who were said to have sang songs of a religiously offensive nature.
PC Stephanie Crawford said: "This sort of behaviour is not acceptable and other passengers should not be forced to tolerate it during a train journey.
"I am appealing for anyone who was on the train and can provide information which can help identify the men responsible to contact BTP as a matter of urgency."
