Parish Priest Fr McGuckien told mourners of the 22-year-old's "deep reservoir of goodness".
He said: "Eamonn in his short life had achieved so much.
"He had so much more to give from a deep reservoir of talent and goodness that he constantly tapped into during his 22 years."
He added: "Tomorrow would have marked the first anniversary of Eamonn becoming a professional boxer.
"Last September he also began third level education at the University of Ulster. He had a very promising professional career ahead of him.
"How ironic that in the darkness of the night that this young man with such a bright and promising future should be taken from us in such a cruel manner."
Mr Magee, who was the son of former WBU welterweight champion Eamonn Magee Sr, was stabbed on the outskirts of west Belfast in the early hours of last Saturday morning.
A 32-year-old barman appeared in court on Tuesday charged with the murder.
The funeral Mass at St Joseph's Church, Hannahstown, was followed by burial in the adjoining cemetery.
