Wales have 'capable' reputation thanks to Euro 2016 run - Martin O'Neill

Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill says Wales' Euro 2016 run means they have earned a "capable" reputation around Europe.

Wales reached the semi-final in their first major international tournament since 1958 but have struggled for form since, winning once in four matches.
The Republic, who lead Group D, face off against Wales in a crucial World Cup qualifier in Dublin on Friday.
"Expectation is very, very high, not only in Wales itself," O'Neill said.
He continued: "The expectation from within Europe itself is that Wales are very, very capable. They possess some excellent players in their side and obviously a world-class player in Gareth Bale."
After beating Moldova 4-0 in their first qualifier in September, Wales have drawn against Austria, Georgia and Serbia since.
Neil Taylor said Wales had to adapt their style of play after the Euros while Ben Davies denied they had experienced a "hangover" after such a successful tournament.
"I don't think there's been any lull. Perhaps they might have thought they'd have won one of those matches," O'Neill added.
"But the Georgia game, which they could easily have been beaten in, that was never going to be easy at all.
"We had played them [Georgia] a few days earlier and Seamus [Coleman] got the goal to win the game, but they played brilliantly in the first half against us in the match, so the games are not easy.
"But are Wales suffering? I don't see that at all, I genuinely don't see that. Wales are capable of winning football matches home or away."
