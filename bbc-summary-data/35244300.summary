After a brief respite on Tuesday, the main three US indexes fell more than 1% on Wednesday.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell by 55.67 points to 4,835.77.
A sell-off on Monday, the first day of 2016 trading, was triggered by losses on China's stock markets, where trading was halted early following a 7% fall in its main index.
There was no repeat on Wednesday, with the Shanghai Composite making gains of 2.3%. But US investors' fears were compounded by other events, including North Korea's claim that it had tested a hydrogen bomb.
Among Wall Street's fallers, Apple was down 2%. Telecoms giant Verizon fell 0.86% after it emerged that the firm was looking to sell off its data centre assets and concentrate on its core business.
Oil prices reached an 11-year low with US crude reaching $33.99 a barrel, while Brent crude finished at $34.35 a barrel.
