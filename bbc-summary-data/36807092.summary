[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Citigroup's profits fell in the second quarter because of weakness at its consumer banking business.

The 14% fall in net income to $4bn (Â£3bn) was not as bad as feared. In June, chief executive Michael Corbat warned of a 25% fall in net income.
Consumer banking in North America had a weak quarter. Net income fell 22%, hit by falling sales and higher costs.
But its trading operations were strong in the April-to-June period, with a 10% increase in revenue to $4.7bn.
In particular, the bank's bond trading business did well, reporting a 14% increase in revenue to $3.5bn.
Citigroup attributed the rise to more activity from its big clients.
However, banking analyst Christopher Wheeler from Atlantic Securities believes that business saw a boost in trading activity following the UK's vote to leave the European Union.
In a statement accompanying the results, Mr Corbat said: "These results demonstrate our ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment, again highlighting the resilience of our institution."
Rival banking giant Wells Fargo reported a 3.5% fall in quarterly net income to $5.17bn, which was in line with market expectations.
Wells Fargo profits were hit by the company making extra provisions for loans going bad.
