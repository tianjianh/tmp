Next England boss will 'not just be a mercenary for short term gain'

England's next manager will "not just be a mercenary for short term gain", says Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn.

In the last 20 years, only Roy Hodgson and Sven-Goran Eriksson have managed England through three tournaments.
Gareth Southgate has been in temporary charge since Sam Allardyce left his post after a newspaper investigation.
Glenn said: "In the past we've gone for foreign managers who'd be attracted as they might help us win a tournament."
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Glenn added: "They haven't maybe left the international set up in a better place.
"We want somebody there for the long term."
Glenn said the next manager would have to address the "fear factor" of playing for England.
"We have been very successful at winning tournaments in the development teams," he said. "The under-21s, the under-19s, when we put our boys up against the best in the world we are winning.
"We're not translating that enough when it comes to the senior team.
"We think the difference is psychological preparation, this fear factor when you put on the England shirt.
"The manager we hire will really understand that and will have detailed plans to address it."
England won their first game under interim manager Southgate, a 2-0 success over Malta in a World Cup qualifier. They drew their next qualifier away to Slovenia 0-0.
Southgate will remain in charge for the qualifier against Scotland at Wembley on 11 November and the home friendly with Spain four days later.
"He will almost certainly be a candidate. It's up to him to decide whether he wants to do it," added Glenn.
