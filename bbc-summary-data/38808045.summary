[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County manager Kevin Nolan has registered himself as a player and loaned West Brom forward Tahvon Campbell until the end of the season.

Nolan was appointed by the struggling League Two club on 12 January, but the 34-year-old midfielder was unable to play because of a transfer embargo.
However, debts to HM Revenue & Customs and other clubs have now been settled.
Campbell, 20, has scored two goals in 36 League Two games across two loan spells with Yeovil.
Owner Alan Hardy has confirmed that former Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United and West Ham man Nolan can now play.
"It was always Kevin's intention to register as a player," Hardy said. "He will need to continue building his fitness but, when he's ready, I'm confident we will have one of, if not, the best midfielders in the league."
Notts made Mark Yeates their first signing of the transfer window on Monday night.
