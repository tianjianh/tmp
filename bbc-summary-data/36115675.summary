When applications closed at midday on Friday, 1,924 people had been sent postal votes, which represents 6.4% of those on the electoral role.
They have until midday on Wednesday to deliver their completed ballot slips, either by post or by hand, to Sir Charles Frossard House.
Wednesday is polling day across the island.
Registrar-general of electors Mark de Garis: "Anyone on the electoral roll could choose to vote by post and our goal was to make the process as straightforward as possible.
"The popularity of postal voting is increasing... it's important that we continue to make it a quick and easy process."
Postal voting has been allowed in Guernsey since 1972 and has grown significantly in recent years; 662 in 2000, 1,513 in 2004, 1,386 in 2008 and 1,685 in 2012.
