Led by fire officer Dave Curry, the team created a giant Indian bread, weighing 26kg (57lb 5oz) and measuring 3.79m (12ft 5in) by 1.4m (4ft 7in).
The cooking feat, carried out at the Eastleigh Mela in Hampshire on 6 July, was confirmed as successful on Tuesday by the Guinness World Records.
This beats the 2008 record naan, which weighed 9.5kg (20lb 15oz).
That creation was cooked by Loblaw Companies Limited in Brampton, Ontario, Canada and measured 2.89m (9ft 6in) by 1m (3ft 4in).
Mr Curry said they were "absolutely thrilled" to have the record confirmed.
"We were also able to raise several hundred pounds for charity through selling the naan at the Eastleigh Mela," he said.
"As well as being a record-breaker, it tasted good too as it quickly sold out."
The Hampshire firefighters' enormous naan bread, which was sold for Â£3 per portion with a curry, raised money for The Fire Fighters Charity, Water Wells Project and Hampshire Hurricanes.
It was created with the help of Badi Mirchi and Sanjha restaurants.
