[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembrokeshire council could scrap chief's post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive role at Pembrokeshire council could be scrapped following a review by councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The post has been vacant since Bryn Parry-Jones quit in October after it emerged he received cash payments in lieu of pension contributions.
On Thursday, councillors met with the aim of starting the process of replacing him.
But instead they voted to hold a review into whether they need a chief executive at all.
It will look into whether to share out the role's responsibilities among other executives, as is done in some councils in England.
Councillors will be given the final say on the future of the role, the meeting was assured, and if they vote to get rid of the role, they will be the first authority in Wales without a chief executive.
Mr Parry-Jones was the highest paid council chief executive in Wales with a salary of almost £195,000 plus benefits.
As part of the deal, he was given a £90k Porsche lease car as his work vehicle,
He got a £277,000 severance deal after quitting his job in October.
He came under pressure to resign after it was revealed he received cash payments in lieu of pension contributions, which the Wales Audit Office said were unlawful.
Police inquiries into the payments were dropped after no evidence was found of criminal offences.
In July, the council said it would take no further action to reclaim the money from him or another unnamed senior officer involved in a similar arrangement.
