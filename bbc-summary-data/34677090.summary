The creators of a new app have teamed up with animal shelters.
Many people don't have time to look after their own pets because they're busy at school or work.
But now for a fee people can have cat and a keeper delivered to their door in a taxi - and they can spend 15 minutes cuddling and stroking the animal.
It's a purr-fect way to spend  your break.
