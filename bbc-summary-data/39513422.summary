During the year they hosted an England Test and a T20 game against Pakistan and sold out Old Trafford for their T20 Roses match against Yorkshire.
The Red Rose county also used to pitch to host a number of music concerts and saw record profits for hosted events.
After a battle with relegation, they maintained their Division One status in the County Championship last season.
"The club continues to carefully manoeuvre its way through the myriad of challenges provided by the ground re-development programme and the competitive trading environment," said finance director Lee Morgan.
Lancashire have also announced that chairman Michael Cairns will retire from the position he has held since 2008.
