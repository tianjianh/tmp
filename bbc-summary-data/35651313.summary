The 23-year-old striker joined from Millwall for the rest of the end of the season on Monday, his second temporary deal at Sixfields.
"John was outstanding, exactly what we wanted," Wilder said.
"He had energy, aggression, he ran away from them a couple of times, was a goal threat and scored, so he can be delighted with his second debut."
Marquis has had seven loan spells at six different clubs since making his Millwall debut in 2009 and got Northampton's second goal in their 2-1 win at York on Tuesday night.
"Getting to the pace I didn't think would be a problem, the way I play is quite high intensity, it was just how long I could go really," Marquis told BBC Radio Northampton, after playing 60 minutes of the match.
"It was planned before to get an hour and I put everything I had into the hour for fitness.
"I was a bit rusty here and there and I had a good chance in the first half, which I think when I'm fit and sharp I'll be taking.
"Apart from that it was good, and nice to get some minutes in the legs."
