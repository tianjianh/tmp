A 20-year-old from Everton is being held at a Merseyside police station for questioning.
Updates on this story and more from Merseyside and Cheshire
Police have ruled out there being "an arranged fight involving groups on quad bikes" in the area where the teenager was shot.
Locals claimed on Monday that a "gang fight had been arranged" in the area.
Det Ch Insp Tom Keaton said that was not the case, adding the motive for the shooting was still unknown.
He said there had been "speculation that there was an arranged fight on the night, involving groups on quad bikes, [but] we have no information to suggest that this is the case and we are still working to establish why Lewis was shot".
Det Ch Insp Keaton added that officers knew that the teenager "left home on Sunday night at about 22:15 to go to a local shop - what we now need to know is where was Lewis between 22:15 and 23:10?"
"Lewis's family are absolutely devastated"
"His friends, his peers and his family are totally bemused as to why this is happened.
"On the face of it he was a very vivacious young man who was very popular in the local community."
Items including mobile phones and jackets had been recovered from the canal, near to where the teenager was found, which were being forensically examined, Det Ch Insp Keaton said.
He added that officers were also looking at CCTV footage from the area.
