'At Home' is the first in a series of exhibitions at the attraction near Wakefield to mark the 70th anniversary of the Arts Council Collection.
Other artworks on show include pieces by pop-artist Roy Lichtenstein, Sophie Calle and sculptor Barbara Hepworth.
The exhibition runs from 19 March to 3 July.
The show will mark the reopening of the park's Bothy Gallery, following its recent refurbishment.
A spokesperson for Yorkshire Sculpture Park (YSP) said: "The exhibition references the gallery as former dwelling, but also the sense of YSP as a sanctuary for many and our continued work with hard-to-reach communities, including those who have made the region their home whether by choice or forced migration."
The Arts Council Collection features nearly 8,000 works by more than 2,000 artists.
It was formed when the Arts Council of Great Britain was founded in 1946.
