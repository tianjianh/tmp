Commuter trains were also affected by the weather during the morning.
Southeastern said services on some routes ran at reduced speed, but it worked closely with Network Rail to minimise the impact to travellers.

Passengers were also urged to check the Southeastern website before they started their journeys.
Southern planned to run a full service across its network but said the stormy weather could cause some delays.
The wintry conditions slowed traffic on the M25 in Kent and Surrey and M23 in Sussex, but there have were no reports of major problems.
Kent County Council's highways department said driving conditions were more difficult than usual and urged motorists to "drive with caution".
The Met Office said the gale force winds and outbreaks of rain would ease.
