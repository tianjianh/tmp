Christy George, 38, from Hucknall, was jailed in July for causing a crash on the M1 in Leicestershire after becoming distracted on her phone in 2014.
Her car crashed into a lorry which ploughed onto the opposite carriageway in an eight vehicle pile-up.
Leicestershire Police released the image in a warning film.
The release of the film follows the announcement that penalty points and fines for drivers caught using handheld mobile phones are to double next year.
More on this and other Leicestershire stories
George deleted a record of calls made during her journey after her Skoda hit a lorry which crashed through to the opposite carriageway.
It spilled its load of beer barrels and crashed into a BMW travelling in the opposite direction, killing Murray Simpson, from London.
Liese Bowers-Straw, from Nottinghamshire, was also involved in the crash which broke her neck in two places, tore muscles across her hips and stomach, and injured her brain.
She has not returned to work and struggles to leave her home because of the trauma.
She said: "I remember thinking 'that's it, I'm a goner, I'm dead' and then I don't remember anything else until the following day.
"The collision has completely changed my way of life. I have gone from having a career I loved... to being a prisoner in my own home doing absolutely nothing."
Det Con Pete Davies said it was the "largest collision site" he had ever investigated.
He said: "Someone died in this collision and Liese has been left with the most appalling injuries as a result of someone who was too selfish to wait to make a call."
George was jailed for five years and banned from the road for 10 years.
