Ornaments, pictures and flowers were removed from a number of graves and scattered across the grounds of Enagh Cemetery some time between Wednesday and Friday morning.
Ronald Moore, who is from Limavady, told the BBC his daughter died in 2012 following complications with her lungs.
"We were devastated to find Alyssa-Cole's grave wrecked," Mr Moore said.
"On her third day her little organs stopped working and she passed away in our arms. This was the only time we got to hold her," he added.
"It was the most difficult time in our lives and to find her grave wrecked has left us so angry and heart-broken. They treated her things like rubbish.
"We want CCTV put up in the cemetery, if it's not up already. I would even watch the graveyard at night myself if I could.
"It's our space to remember her and no one should take that away from us. We are so hurt."
A woman, who did not want to be identified, said flowers were pulled out of her son's grave on Thursday night.
"Fresh flowers were put on his grave for his anniversary and they were ripped apart," she said.
"My little boy died with cancer in 2013 and it ripped our lives apart. Why would someone do this to us?
"I've been crying all day. That's my wee man's grave. I hope the police catch them."
A police spokesperson said they were aware of the incident and have appealed for information.
DUP councillor Alan Robinson said: "These types of incidents are very upsetting for loved ones who visit gravesides for comfort, private time and to pay respect.
"Unfortunately there are some in society who have no respect and I would say to those individuals who are frequenting this cemetery that it is not a place for a social gathering or to loiter within.
"It is despicable for anyone to interfere in any way with the resting places of loved ones."
