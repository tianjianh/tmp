The singer will break from the European leg of his latest tour to attend the awards on 13 November at London's Old Vic.
He will co-host the event with the Standard's proprietor Evgeny Lebedev.
"I think we produce some of the best theatre in the world here and I feel passionately that we must support it," said Sir Elton.
"The London stage has nurtured and given a creative voice for many, many talented individuals and it's such a great honour for me to co-host these illustrious theatre awards at The Old Vic this year."
Sir Elton's music has featured in West End shows Billy Elliot and The Lion King.
The shortlist for the awards - first held in 1955 - will be announced at the end of October.
Last year Nicole Kidman and James McAvoy won the top acting prizes, while Imelda Staunton picked up the best musical performance prize for Gypsy.
