England boss Eddie Jones believes English club coaches should work overseas to boost their chances of succeeding at international level.

Stuart Lancaster, the former England head coach, said recently he was interested in coaching in the southern hemisphere.
Jones has urged Lancaster's compatriots to follow suit, adding that he believes the Premiership is "quite insular".
"I would 100% recommend going overseas," the Australian told the BBC.
"There's good things in New Zealand, South African and Australian rugby and for English coaches to experience that would definitely help their development."
Jones was speaking in a wide-ranging interview with BBC Radio 5 live, in which he also compared England fly-half George Ford's development to that of New Zealand great Dan Carter.
The England head coach said at times Ford "probably over-thinks the game", but added: "Carter was probably at his best aged 28.
"He had moments when he made mistakes when he was younger and Ford is still only 23, so is going to make mistakes."
Jones also gave an insight into what he looks for in a player, saying it is not just technical ability but also mentality.
And he spoke about the time Wallaby great George Smith trained with England, saying the 111-cap Australia flanker, who is currently playing for Wasps, "wasn't keen on wearing the kit".
