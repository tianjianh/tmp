Pep Guardiola's City and United, managed by Jose Mourinho, were due to face each other in Beijing in July.
However, torrential rain in the Chinese capital left the Bird's Nest pitch unplayable and the game was called off less than six hours before kick-off.
Both Premier League clubs will travel to the US in July as part of their 2017 pre-season campaigns.
No details have been announced, but both are expected to be involved in the annual International Champions Cup.
The Beijing fixture had been arranged as part of the 2016 edition of the friendly tournament.
