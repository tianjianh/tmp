[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 3-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New signing Yoann Arquin ended Mansfield Town's hoodoo of not scoring in the first half at home all season after just five minutes of their 3-0 victory over struggling Crewe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Whiteman nodded down a Mal Benning cross from the left at the far post and, when Crewe failed to clear, Arquin was on hand to fire the loose ball home from seven yards.
The home debutant might have doubled his tally within three minutes but steered his header over the bar from a Joel Byrom corner.
After Rhys Bennett had sent a good chance into the sidenetting after the break, the Stags went 2-0 up on 48 minutes.
CJ Hamilton's low shot was blocked and the ball ran to Whiteman 18 yards out, whose first-time effort flew through the hands of goalkeeper Ben Garratt.
George Cooper's shot on the turn brought the first real save from Jake Kean in the home goal after 55 minutes.
Bennett then wasted another great chance as he fired wide on the follow-up after Garratt had blocked a low Byrom shot.
Crewe threw everything at the home side, who had one or two scares before Bennett made it safe six minutes from time as he prodded home from close range at the second attempt from a James Baxendale corner.
Crewe have now won just twice in 21 games and fans were calling for boss Steve Davis to go.
