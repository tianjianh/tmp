The Iron have won only two of their last eight league games and suffered a 5-0 defeat at Blackpool at the weekend.
Robins, 46, previously managed Huddersfield Town and Barnsley before joining Scunthorpe in October 2014.
"We are sad to part company with Mark and 'Ned', but we have to think about the best interests of Scunthorpe United Football Club," a club statement said.
Andy Dawson and Nick Daws will take temporary charge of the club while they search for a new manager.
"We don't have a candidate in mind to replace Mark at this stage and it may take a few weeks," club chairman Peter Swann told BBC Radio Humberside.
Scunthorpe are six points above the League One relegation zone, with nine points between them and the final play-off position.
The Iron endured a difficult start to the season, winning just two of their first 10 games, but progressed to the third round of the FA Cup before losing 2-0 at Chelsea.
