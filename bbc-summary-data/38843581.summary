Blackburn had funds to spend in the January transfer window despite their lack of activity, says Rovers football director Paul Senior.

Forwards Marvin Emnes and Lucas Joao both joined on loan, while Celtic defender Efe Ambrose could arrive pending a work permit decision.
They were the only deals done by Rovers, who are in the relegation zone.
"The investment is always there for the right player who becomes available at the right price," said Senior.
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "It was never a case of 'we can't have any money' as there is money and resources there."
Owen Coyle's side have won just one of their last 10 games in the Championship and were beaten at home by Leeds United on Wednesday.
"I had a ridiculous amount of players made available to me during January," added Senior. "It is an expensive month to try and do business and you can make a lot of mistakes if you don't get the right players in.
"Part of my job is also keeping the wrong type of players out of the squad because it would be very easy to say yes, yes, yes, but you end up paying for those mistakes for along time in the future."
