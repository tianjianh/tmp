[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Cain killed 44-year-old Cy Cooper in July after a row over relatives and living arrangements.
He then set Mr Cooper's Sheffield home alight but told police he had tried to save him to explain away forensic evidence found on his clothing.
Cain, of no fixed address, was sentenced to a minimum of 21 years.
Sheffield Crown Court heard he kicked, punched and stamped Mr Cooper to death at his home in Bluebell Close, Wincobank, in the early hours of 29 July.
A post mortem examination revealed Mr Cooper suffered more than 80 injuries.
Det Ch Insp Dave Stopford said: "Mr Cooper was a kind-hearted man who was well liked and respectable.
"He died because of the injuries inflicted by Cain, who then believed he could outwit the authorities and get away with murder."
Mr Cooper's sister said her brother "will always be missed".
