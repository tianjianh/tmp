Surrey v Warwickshire: Mark Footitt takes six wickets in 32 balls as Bears struggle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's Mark Footitt took six wickets in 32 balls as Warwickshire were made to follow on in their opening County Championship game of the season.

The Bears appeared to have bounced back well when Surrey, 405-4 at lunch, were bowled out in mid-afternoon for 454.
But left-arm paceman Footitt took 6-14 in nine overs either side of tea to bowl out the Bears for 91.
Second time around, the shattered Bears reached 29-0 in their second innings, still 334 runs behind.
England contender Footitt finished off last season in spectacular form after a season of injury troubles, claiming five wickets in an innings in all of Surrey's last three matches - two of them at The Oval.
This time, after Sam Curran had removed opener Alex Mellor for 18, his fiery initial burst of 3-0 in nine balls just before the interval sent back Jonathan Trott, Bears captain Ian Bell and Sam Hain all for ducks.
Footitt then removed the Bears' other opener Will Porterfield caught behind for 18, before adding Rikki Clarke and Keith Barker to his personal haul of five Bears ducks.
Only a last-wicket partnership of 30 between Chris Wright, who made an unbeaten 28, and Oliver Hannon-Dalby spared Warwickshire the embarrassment of being dismissed for their lowest Championship total for almost four decades.
Earlier former Bears and Sri Lanka Test batsman Kumar Sangakkara's carefully-constructed 71 from 161 balls had helped push Surrey on before Wright weighed in with a late burst to finish with 5-113.
Surrey fast bowler Mark Footitt told BBC Radio London:
"To take so many wickets for so few runs was fantastic. It was helped by the pressure developed by the other bowlers. We bowled back-to-back maidens, which helped me attack a little more.
"We've worked hard on our fitness and its paying off now. It feels like it's easy to run in and bowl - like I was a couple of years ago - it's really pleasing.
"I never write off playing for England. There are a lot of good bowlers around who are probably in front of me. But, if I keep taking wickets, hopefully they'll recognise it.
"Gareth Batty got a call-up last winter and he was 38! Would I like to go to Australia this winter? I've never even been there, so it would be nice! But let's see what happens."
Warwickshire first team coach Jim Troughton told BBC WM:
"I've seen some good bowling spells over my time and that's right up there.
"Nobody gave their wicket away, but Mark Footitt bowled with pace, shape and bounce and we weren't up to it.
"It was an incredible spell and he ripped us apart. He's going to be a handful against any team.
"We know what we need to do. The nets are open at nine o'clock tomorrow morning and we'll be in there."
