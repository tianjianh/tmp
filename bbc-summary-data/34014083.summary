Rebels from Greece's main party, left-wing Syriza, are to break away and form a new party, Greek media reports say.

Prime minister and Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras stood down on Thursday, paving the way for new elections.
The move came after he lost the support of many of his own MPs in a vote on the country's new bailout with European creditors earlier this month.
Greek media reports say 25 rebel Syriza MPs will join the new party, called Leiki Anotita (Popular Unity).
The party will be led by former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis, who was strongly opposed to the bailout deal, reports say.
A list of MPs joining the party published by the Ta Nea newspaper showed that the parliamentary speaker Zoe Konstantopulou and former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis were not among its members.
Both had opposed a new bailout deal, with Ms Konstantopulou highly critical of her former ally Mr Tsipras.
