A historical landmark in York is to stay open on weekdays throughout the winter to help the city attract more tourists during the season.

Last winter, English Heritage chose to close Clifford's Tower on winter weekdays in response to a 32% cut in its government grant.
The organisation said it had decided to keep the attraction open daily after reviewing demand at its sites.
Local tourist body, Visit York, is supporting the move.
Visit York is currently running a "Wrapped Up" campaign to encourage people to visit the city during the winter months.
Clifford's Tower was built in 1068 in the reign of William the Conqueror.
It has served as a prison and a royal mint, as well as the place where Henry VIII had the bodies of his enemies put on public display.
Liz Page, from English Heritage, said: "Having reviewed last winter's season and the demand at all our properties, Clifford's Tower in York will now be open throughout the winter.
"We recognise we need to play a full part in supporting York as a year-round tourist destination and we're very much looking forward to welcoming thousands more visitors to enjoy the best views of York seven days a week over the coming months."
