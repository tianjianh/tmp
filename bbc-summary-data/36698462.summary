[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former England batsman Jonathan Trott maintained his fine form this season as he helped to ease Warwickshire into a first-innings lead against Surrey.

Replying to Surrey's 273 at Guildford, the Bears moved their overnight score of 12-0 on to 345-6, Trott leading the way with 123, his third first-class century of the summer.
Trott shared a third-wicket stand of 116 with captain Ian Bell (66).
Tim Ambrose (53) and Varun Chopra (42) also weighed in with good knocks.
Unlike Surrey's first-day centurion, Aaron Finch, Trott was given strong support, enjoying century partnerships with both Bell and Ambrose.
Surrey, without a first-class win on this ground since 2002, worked through seven bowlers in an attempt to dismiss Trott.
Sam Curran, available again after completing his A levels, finally succeeded just after the second new ball had been taken. surprising Trott with one that kept low to trap him lbw.
Mark Footitt also bowled sharply on his return to action after two months out with injury.
Surrey pace bowler Mark Footitt told BBC Radio London:
"I think we stuck at it well against two very good batsmen, who put a good partnership on.
"All we can do is stick in there and hope that the wickets will come.
"Just to be out there with the lads and trying to win this game, it's great to be back.
"To keep them to just over 300 on this small ground, on a decent wicket, we're pretty happy with it."
Warwickshire's Jonathan Trott told BBC WM:
"If you bat second, you have got to try and bat big and there's perhaps the opportunity to get a few more and see where the game takes us.
"They bowled well in periods so we had to combat that on a wicket that offers a bit of nibble when you get it in the right areas.
"This is my first hundred against Surrey in four-day cricket. That's another one to tick off. Those are the things you play for at my age. The ones I have left are Leicester and Worcester.
"At this stage of my career, it is about trying to make sure Warwickshire are in a good place and I am contributing. You don't need guys of 35 hanging around."
