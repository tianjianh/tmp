How staying in bed helped one teen do better at school

"I'm definitely not a morning person. It'll probably take me around two hours to wake up," says Alex Strettle.

You may well sympathise with him - especially as winter draws in and it's dark when you get up.
Alex is glad his school changed its start time and instead of beginning at 8.50am, he didn't have to be in until 10am.
"I had an extra hour to get in, which was perfect for me," he says.
Feeling jealous yet?
There is some science to back up claims that giving teenagers like Alex a lie-in actually helps them to do better in exams.
Alex studied at Monkseaton High School in Whitley Bay when it ran a pilot project to see if putting back the beginning of the school day would make a difference to student performance.
With a later start, the percentage of pupils getting five good GCSEs went from around 34% to about 50%.
"In the mornings I'm tired, I cannot focus," says 17-year-old Alex.
"When I was waking up for eight, I just wanted an extra 20 minutes or half an hour, so [starting at] 10 really made a difference."

Experts at the University of Oxford say delaying school start times could help students concentrate better in class and boost exam results.
They argue it's because it takes teenagers two hours more to wake up and start functioning properly than adults.
"I don't think anyone goes through high school without having a few late nights, but for me during high school I was staying up late and waking up late," says Alex.
"I just wanted longer in bed. I wanted to postpone it as much as I could."
He does admit thought, that there were occasions where he could have gone to bed earlier, but stayed up late playing computer games.
Dr Chris Harvey from the University of Oxford says that teenagers should go to school later because they have a different body clock to fully grown adults and therefore work at different times.
More than 100 schools in England will be taking part in a trial to see whether a later school start leads to better exam results.
Alex from Bromsgrove got in touch with Newsbeat to say he doesn't agree with the plans.
"School is there to prepare young people for adult life and work, what message is it sending out by letting them stay up late, wake up late and start late?" he says.
"That's not how it works after school so why start them that way?"
Sophia Georgia Wright wrote on Facebook: "I left school last year and whilst I would have immaturely loved a lie in at the time, I realise now working as an apprentice you need to be getting to your place of work way before 9am, we can't just wrap teens in cotton wool and send them into the world unprepared surely?!"
