Nick-named 'Insight', it's job will be to search for black-holes, and help scientists to understand them better.
Black holes are pretty mysterious things, and so far scientists don't really know much about them.
Using special x-ray technology, Insight will aim to study black holes and send its findings back to researchers here on Earth.
