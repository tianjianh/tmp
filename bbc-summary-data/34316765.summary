Natural Retreats also wants to make improvements to the restaurant, offer conference space and increase its facilities for making snow.
The company has started a consultation on its plans.
The ski centre in the Cairngorms National Park is owned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).
Highland Council has been informed of the proposals.
Natural Retreats owns holiday accommodation at a number of locations in the UK and elsewhere.
It has a 25-year lease for the running of CairnGorm Mountain.
The company said last year that it would invest more than Â£6m in the resort over five years.
