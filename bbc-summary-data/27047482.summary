A sign resembling a large, red Google Maps pin has been spotted on an Oxfordshire roundabout.

The origin of the giant 'A' at Playhatch Roundabout on the A4155 Reading to Henley road is not yet known.
The roundabout is near Sonning-on-Thames, where a red letterbox 'appeared' on a bridge last year.
A BBC Radio Berkshire reporter saw the 'pin' and posted an image on a BBC Facebook page.
"I was just driving to Sonning to go play touch rugby on Monday night and the sign caught my eye as I went round Playhatch Roundabout," said reporter Catherine Bolsover.
"I asked around on Twitter but no-one knew where it had come from or who had made it.
"One suggestion was that it's linked to whoever put a postbox on Sonning Bridge."
In response to her Facebook photograph, one person commented: "Noticed this yesterday nearly drove on to it!"
Anita Trif, a waitress at The Crown pub nearby, said no-one knew where the sign had come from.
"I first saw it on Friday or Saturday," she added.
"We have all seen it but have no idea where it's come from. We have all been wondering about it."
