Henry Bolton's daughter Victoria was born in a Southeastern train carriage at London's St Pancras station at about 17:00 BST on Sunday.
Paramedics sealed off the platform after his wife Tatiana Smurova-Bolton, 41, went into labour during the journey into the capital.
Mr Bolton cut the umbilical cord while the baby was on the floor of the train.
He then handed her to his wife.
The UKIP candidate for Kent PCC, who was defeated in the 5 May election, tweeted: "Mum and baby very well."
"The staff on the train and at the station were outstanding," Mr Bolton told the BBC.
"We got the train as we knew the traffic wasn't excellent and we would end up stuck on the motorway.
"By the time we got to St Pancras it was clear that things had progressed as my wife couldn't stand.
"I told the security staff on the platform what was happening and they started everything off from there. The platform was sealed off and they couldn't have done more."
The first six carriages of the 12-car train split off and left the station on its next journey after only a four-minute delay.
The former Army intelligence officer received 87,978 votes in the Kent Police and Crime Commissioner election, losing to Conservative Matthew Scott.
