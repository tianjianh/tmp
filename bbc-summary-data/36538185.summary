Kirsty Aitchison, 30, from the city's Robroyston area, left Campus bar in Sauchiehall Street, at 03:00 on Sunday.
CCTV footage later showed the mother-of-four "walking quickly and with purpose" at the Broomielaw, by the River Clyde, at 03:16.
Police divers could be seen searching the river on Wednesday morning.
Insp Stuart Clemenson  said, "Officers are continuing to carry out inquiries, review other CCTV footage and use specialist resources to search for Kirsty. We ask local communities to continue to help us by sharing the appeals, raising awareness and contacting us with any information they may have.
"Police Scotland has specialised, trained resources including search officers and the air support unit to support those community policing officers conducting inquiries.
"We're aware of speculation about Kirsty's movements however her last confirmed sighting is at the Broomielaw and we are currently focussing our efforts there and in the city centre."
Kirsty Aitchison's mother Fay said, "Whilst this is a very difficult time for us all as we wait in hope to hear from Kirsty, I would personally like to thank all her friends, family members and people from the Deaf community who have been busy raising awareness of the fact that my lovely daughter is missing.
"The sharing of information and searching areas for Kirsty is very much appreciated by us all.
"The police are speaking to us continually with updates on their search for Kirsty and we hope to have her returned to us safe and well as we miss her terribly."
CCTV footage showed Ms Aitchison making her way down from Sauchiehall Street to Argyle Street and on to James Watt Street before walking down to the Broomielaw, where she was last viewed on CCTV.
The footage confirms she was wearing the same clothing as in the photograph released to the media, which was taken on Saturday evening.
Ms Aitchison was described as white, a Deaf/BSL user, about 5ft tall, slim build and long dark-coloured hair.
She was wearing a black top, cream skirt and in the CCTV images she is seen holding her high-heeled black sandals and walking barefoot.
Police Scotland has also set up a dedicated email address for anyone with information to contact.
