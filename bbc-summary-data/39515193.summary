Dylan Hartley says he is pleased to be back in a Northampton shirt having made his first Premiership appearance in five months.

The England captain returned to the Saints' side in their 36-31 defeat by Leicester on 25 March.
"I've had a frustrating 18 months I suppose," hooker Hartley, 31, told BBC Radio Northampton.
"I haven't played as much rugby for Saints as I'd have liked, but playing against Leicester was a great feeling."
Due to a combination of England duty, suspensions and concussion absences, Hartley has made only 15 appearances for Northampton in the last two seasons.
But while he has no plans to end his international ambitions to prolong his club career, he is now looking forward to helping Saints' pursuit of the top four.
He said: "I want to play my best and play in the best teams and part of that is going away with England.
"I've done it for almost 10 years now and that's something I'll never give up on, but I love playing for Northampton and I want to play as many games as possible.
"With the intensity England train at, I feel fit and I felt like I played a good game against Leicester, so form-wise I feel good.
"It's just good to be back playing in a Saints shirt because it's been a while."
Meanwhile, former Saints captain Lee Dickson will join Championship side Bedford Blues as a player-coach at the end of the season.
The 32-year-old scrum-half has played 250 times for Northampton since his move from Newcastle in 2008.
