The 41-year-old was walking in Westwood Crescent, Hamilton, when he was attacked by three men who got out of a dark BMW car at about 16:15 on Monday.
The man is being treated for his injuries at Wishaw General Hospital.
Police are trying to establish a motive and are studying CCTV footage and conducting door-to-door inquiries. They have appealed for witnesses.
The three suspects are described as between 20 to 30 years old.
Two of the men were wearing black jackets with goggles stitched into the hoods.
The third man was wearing a camouflage jacket. He had blond hair which was shaved close on the side.
Dot Sgt Martin McKendrick, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a particularly vicious attack and as yet we have still to establish a motive.
"I want to reassure those living in the area that incidents of this nature are rare. We are doing all that we can currently to trace those responsible. We have conducted door-to-door inquiries and we continue to analyse available CCTV.
"I would like to speak to anyone who was in the vicinity of Westwood Crescent on 12 January around 1600 hours who either witnessed this attack or has noticed a dark BMW vehicle in the area."
Det Sgt McKendrick added: "It's important we trace those responsible and any information you may have could greatly assist our investigation."
