[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the RMT and Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) unions are taking industrial action in protest at plans to close ticket offices on the London Underground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-hour strike will last from 18:00 GMT on Sunday and will continue until Monday evening.
Tube bosses have warned commuters the majority of underground stations in Central London will be closed.
Transport for London (TfL) says the majority of Zone 1 stations will be closed and other parts of the network will be severely affected too.
Piccadilly line services are expected to run between Hammersmith and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 3, but not to Terminals 4 or 5.
National Rail services are not directly affected but there will be no Underground services from stations such as Victoria, King's Cross, Waterloo, Paddington, Euston, Bank and London Bridge.

There will be no service at all on the Victoria or Waterloo & City lines, and all other lines are expected to be severely affected, with limited services in outer London.

Buses, roads and rail services including the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) are all expected to be much busier than usual.
TfL is laying on 100 extra buses and "enhanced" river services to help customers get around the city. Travel Ambassadors will be on hand to advise on alternative routes, but your best bet might be to walk or cycle if you are able.
Here is a walking map of central London showing the walking time, in minutes, between stops.
If you are planning to drive, be aware of these major road works that may affect your journey:
LONDON BRIDGE: Tooley Street eastbound is closed for major long-term upgrades at London Bridge Station from the A3 Borough High Street/Duke Street Hill to Bermondsey Street
FARRINGDON: There are narrow lanes because of major Crossrail works on the A201 Farringdon Road between Cowcross Street (Farringdon Station) and Charterhouse Street
MILLBANK: There are narrow lanes and one lane is closed because of junction improvements on the A3212 Millbank at Horseferry Road (Lambeth Bridge)
CANNON STREET: Westbound is closed for carriageway repairs between King William Street and Queen Victoria Street (Mansion House)
BLOOMSBURY: Great Russell Street Westbound is closed for gas mains work between Museum Street and the A400 Bloomsbury Street.  It is only one-way (eastbound) from Bloomsbury Street towards the British Museum
HOLLOWAY: The A1 Holloway Road is closed in both directions because of major roadworks between Fairbridge Road (Upper Holloway Station) and Marlborough Road
Roads on the edge of the congestion charge zone are also expected to be busier than normal.
