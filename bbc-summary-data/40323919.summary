Shortly after midnight a van drove into a crowd of worshippers coming out of evening prayers at a mosque in Finsbury Park in North East London.
There are extra police in the area, making things safe, and many of the roads nearby have been closed.
Several people are being looked after in hospital and one person has sadly died.
Police believe the driver of the van was acting alone, and a man has been arrested at the scene.

Prime Minister Theresa May said police are calling the incident a terrorist attack, and said "Hatred and evil of this kind will never succeed."
Mrs May spoke outside Downing Street and said, "Our thoughts and prayers this morning are with the family and friends of the man who died and those who were injured."
She thanked the quick response of police and the emergency services.
Mrs May has promised extra police resources to reassure communities, especially around Mosques.
She also said, "It is a reminder that terrorism, extremism and hatred take many forms; and our determination to tackle them must be the same whoever is responsible."
The Prime Minister described the Capital as "home to a multitude of communities that together make London one of the greatest cities on earth."
Home Secretary Amber Rudd described it as an appalling incident, and said:
"We must all continue to stand together, resolute, against all those who try to divide us and spread hate and fear."
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is also the local MP for the area, said on Twitter: "I'm totally shocked at the incident at Finsbury Park tonight.
"I've been in touch with the mosques, police and Islington council regarding the incident. My thoughts are with those and the community affected by this awful event."
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan promised extra police to reassure people in the area, especially those observing Ramadan. He has also asked people to "remain calm and vigilant".
