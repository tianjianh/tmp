Plans for a new 33ft (10m) tall sculpture to be erected next to Hull's ancient defence walls have been submitted by the city council.

The Beverley Gate was where King Charles I was refused entry to Hull in 1642, sparking the English Civil War.
Last year, the authority wanted to cover up the site for its City of Culture 2017 plans but ruled it out after a campaign against the idea.
It said the stainless steel statue would be "an engaging piece of art".
Entitled Shadow Gate, the artwork would be positioned to the south west of Beverley Gate, between Whitefriargate and King Edward Street.
Architects Tonkin Liu said: "Shadow Gate invokes the imagery of the trading ships masts and sails in the urban realm at Beverley Gate.
"Careful consideration has been made to position the sculpture to minimise any harmful impact to surrounding historical buildings."
The council said it was "unable to supply costs" of the project as it was part of the City of Culture 2017 public realm works.
Last month the authority approved revised plans to revamp Beverley Gate, after people voted for the site to be left open and redeveloped with amphitheatre-style seating and glass fencing to replace the existing rails.
The remains were granted protection by the government in January because of the "national importance of Hull's 14th Century town walls".
Final decision for approving the revamp scheme will be given by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
