Midfielder Joe Ledley believes the Football Association of Wales will make the ''right decision'' on how best to mark Armistice Day in the World Cup qualifier against Serbia.

FAW officials have yet to decide how to commemorate the occasion after Fifa could not guarantee that there would not be disciplinary proceedings if a poppy was displayed.
England and Scotland will defy Fifa's ban on players wearing poppies in their meeting on Friday.
With the FAW yet decide their policy, Ledley said: ''We will support whatever decision they make.''
Fifa's regulations say players' equipment should not carry any commercial, personal, political or religious messages.
When the issue arose in 2011, a compromise was reached in which Wales players were allowed to wear armbands with the poppy symbol in a friendly against Norway.
Northern Ireland will mark Armistice Day by wearing plain black armbands in the World Cup qualifier against Azerbaijan in Belfast.
The Irish FA had requested permission from Fifa to wear a poppy on the shirt or armband.
Breaching Fifa regulations could result in a fine or even a loss of points and the FAW are set to leave a decision until as late as possible.
They have already planned a two minute silence during training on Armistice Day's on Friday and there will also be a tribute at the game regardless of whether poppies are worn.
Crystal Palace's Ledley said Wales' players are content to leave the decision over poppies to the Football Association of Wales.
''It is obviously out of our hands. It is dealt with by the FA of Wales," Ledley added.
"It is down to them too take the decision. We will support whatever decision they make.
''As players our job is just to concentrate on the game, I am sure the FAW will make the right decision.''
