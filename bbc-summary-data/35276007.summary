Paddy Doherty: Funeral for veteran civil rights activist

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral for veteran civil rights activist Paddy Doherty has taken place in Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Doherty, 89, died following an illness.
He was very active in the civil rights movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s and, subsequently, worked for the community in his city.
Hundreds gathered at St Eugene's Cathedral in Derry for Requiem Mass on Sunday.
They heard Father Paul Farren pay tribute to Mr Doherty, telling mourners: "Where there is no road, some people build a road".
Mr Doherty was on the front line during the "Battle of the Bogside" in 1969 and became known as "Paddy Bogside".
Three days of rising tensions between the nationalist residents of the Bogside in Derry and the RUC (Royal Ulster Constabulary) over an Apprentice Boys parade brought British troops on to the streets of Northern Ireland for the first time.
After three days of fighting, a truce was called and the barricades surrounding the Bogside were replaced by a white line.
Mr Doherty went on to work with the Irish Foundation for Human Development in the city.
This led to the establishment of the Derry Youth and Community Workshop, the North West Centre for Learning and Development and the Inner City Trust.
In 2010, he received an honorary degree for his services to community development.
