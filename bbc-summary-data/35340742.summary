Gomez, 37, shot a final round 62 to finish level with the 35-year-old American on 20 under par before both players parred the first play-off hole.
However, a birdie on the second extra hole gave Gomez the title.
"I'm really, really happy. I felt good all week long and was able to put on a great round," the Argentine said.
His other Tour triumph came at the St Jude Classic in Tennessee in June 2015 and his latest victory takes him to 55th in the world rankings.
That keeps him in contention to represent Argentina at the Rio Olympics in August.
"I'm really excited about being able to get in the Olympics," he added. "It depends on how things go with other players, but I feel like I will be almost there."
England's Greg Owen came in tied fifth, five shots behind Gomez and Snedeker.
