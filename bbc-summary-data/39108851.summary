The 28-year-old suffered the injury to his right hand during January's tour of India but a scan confirmed he has sufficiently recovered.
The Nottinghamshire batsman will rejoin his international team-mates three days before the first match in Antigua on 3 March.
Hales tweeted: "Antigua tomorrow. Can't wait to get back amongst it!"
"Alex Hales arrives tomorrow evening local time," the ECB confirmed.
"He will continue his rehab with us until the medical and coaching teams deem he is fit enough to join the squad officially."
England warmed up for their three-match one-day series in the West Indies with a 117-run win over a Vice Chancellor's XI.
An unbeaten 47 from Chris Woakes led England to a narrow two-wicket win over a President's XI in their final warm up game in the West Indies on Monday.
Jonny Bairstow earlier made 86 to push his case for selection for the first ODI on Friday.
Meanwhile Jake Ball is to undergo a scan after sustaining a leg injury.
