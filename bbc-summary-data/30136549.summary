It happened at a house in Cecilia's Walk in the Creggan area at about 18:00 GMT on Thursday.
A baby, a five-year-old child, and the man's partner were in the house when masked gunmen burst into the kitchen.
The man was taken out of the house to the doorstep and shot at least four times in the leg. Police have appealed for anyone with information about the incident to contact them.
A neighbour of the man said: "It must have been terrifying, especially for the children.
"It's very, very scary. We don't know what's going to happen at anytime, anywhere."
SDLP MLA for the city, Pat Ramsey, described the attack as "completely unacceptable" and blamed dissident republicans.
"This is a horrific incident for which there can be no excuse," he said.
"As our city prepares for Christmas, with what should be such a happy event in our Guildhall where thousands gathered to welcome Santa and cheer (for) the mayor as she turned on the lights, it is terrible that the focus will also be on such human rights abusers in Creggan.
"Is this really the message we want to send out about our city?"
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Patricia Logue said there could be "no place for this type of activity" in Derry.
