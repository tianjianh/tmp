The man was pronounced dead after the car he was in hit a wall in Dunstable, just after 12:00 BST.
Bedfordshire Police said they believed the same man was with a woman in Albion Street shortly before noon when they had cash stolen from them.
The force said it had an "open mind" as to whether the two incidents are linked.
The couple were allegedly robbed by two Asian women understood to have been in their 20s or 30s and wearing light-coloured long tops with blue patterns on them.
