Glen Yates, 78, was found by police at an address in Hudson Road, Blackpool in Lancashire, on Tuesday. His death is not thought to be suspicious.
The next day officers were called back to the "completely ransacked" property to find cash and two medals missing.
They believe thieves smashed through a window after seeing the emergency services and the undertaker leave.
PC Daniel Swarbrick said: "Mr Yates' family are obviously grieving the loss of a beloved father and grandfather, but they have been dealt a double blow knowing his house has since been targeted by thieves.
"Several items of great sentimental value to the family have gone missing and they are desperate to get them back."
Mr Yates was given Army service medals while working in Malaysia.
He was presented with them a few years ago at Fulwood Barracks, police said.
