Lynn Hodson said she was walking her cocker spaniel in a part of Sutton Park in Sutton Coldfield banned to traffic, when the moped "came out of nowhere".
She said it "ploughed through the crowd" and hit her dog, Rorie, before the rider and passenger fled.
West Midlands Police said officers were investigating the collision on Sunday afternoon.
The young dog was hit while the park was busy on Sunday afternoon. It died at the scene.

"There were lots of families around, lots of dogs off their lead, lots of dog walkers and he'd just gone over to say hello to another dog," Mrs Dodson told the BBC.
"These two lads on a moped just came out of nowhere... doing at least 30 to 40mph... and threw him up in the air.
"They got back on the moped and fled. There were quite a few chasing them, telling them to stop."
Mrs Hodson, whose husband died last year, said she was with her daughters Gemma and Kerry, and Gemma's boyfriend Dave, at the park.
She said Rorie had been with her since he was eight weeks old and was taken to Sutton Park "probably two or three times" a week.
"We're just absolutely devastated. He was part of our family," she added.
"[It's] taken our little dog away from us, who we loved."
