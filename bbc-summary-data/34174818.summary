English Channel ferry worker strike chaos prompts union apology

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The union boss who led striking ferry workers in Calais has apologised for the disruption caused in the UK but has not ruled out fresh action.

MyFerryLink staff occupied two ferries and blocked the Channel Tunnel in July and August in protests over job losses.
The disruption to cross-Channel traffic led to Operation Stack's implementation on the M20 in Kent numerous times.
Eric Vercoutre, of Syndicat Maritime Nord, said: "We're truly sorry about what happened."
However, he warned there could be more strike action next month.
"If, on the 1st October, we don't get the redundancy payments that we're legally entitled to and our September wages we'll blockade the port again."
MyFerryLink staff began blockading the Port of Calais in June ahead of the company ceasing operations on 1 July, with the loss of hundreds of jobs.
After weeks of disruption, the dispute between the French government and ferry workers was resolved last week, with a deal to employ 402 French workers with Eurotunnel and DFDS Seaways.
"Our aim really wasn't to make life difficult for the British," Mr Vercoutre said.
"It's always the people lower down who suffer - lorry drivers, employees - that's not the aim.
"The aim is to make those higher up do something, ministers both in the UK and France.
"They only do something when we set tyres on fire, when we block miles of roads. They only react then, that's just not right."
But Donald Armour, of the Freight Transport Association, said the French government had not done enough to broker a deal to prevent further blockades.
"It looks like a pussyfooting deal. There doesn't seem to be any real negotiation behind it," he said.
"If it was done properly we'd like to have seen Calais and the Cocquelles area made a strike-free zone as part of the settlement.
"All we can do, through the government, is express our concern because the French are still holding a gun to the UK economy's head. That's no settlement for us."
Mr Armour said his organisation was pushing for compensation from the French government but it would be "very difficult" to get and "no promises" were being made to members.
