Norma Peace lives with her husband in the Yorkshire village of Sutton-in-Craven.
Although she has often been abroad to ski, she was inspired by her grandson Sam to give snowboarding a try.
She took up her new hobby in April and now totally loves it.
She told BBC Sport reporter Nick Hope she would recommend "anyone, of any age" to give snowboarding a go.
