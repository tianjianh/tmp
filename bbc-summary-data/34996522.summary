Raghunath Vokkaliga opened the scoring early in the second quarter for India before Talwinder Singh scored from a tight angle with 20 minutes to play.
Simon Mantell deflected Ian Sloan's penalty corner into the goal for GB late in the fourth quarter.
But India saw out the match for a deserved win to secure a semi-final spot in front of ecstatic home fans.
Great Britain had gone into the match as the favourites having topped their pool - while India had come bottom of theirs.
"We created chances but our execution at key moments was our downfall, really," head coach Bobby Crutchley told BBC Sport.
"In the first half we were passive but in the second half we had a lot of the pressure - and under those circumstances we need to execute better.
"There's lots to be pleased about though, and, although they'll be incredibly disappointed, the players will have learnt a lot from tonight."
