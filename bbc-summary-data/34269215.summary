The Liberal Democrats have unveiled plans to build 20,000 affordable homes in Wales if the party is in government after the 2016 assembly election.

The target, to be met by 2021, is double that set by Welsh Labour ministers in the current assembly term.
Lib Dem AM Peter Black said the Lib Dems would fund the proposals using new borrowing powers and by scrapping plans for an M4 relief road.
He said action was needed to tackle a "crippling undersupply of housing".
