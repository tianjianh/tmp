A pollution incident at a Scottish government-owned bull stud farm is under control, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Livestock faeces had entered a burn that runs near the farm at Knocknagael and down through housing developments in Inverness.
Sepa, which was alerted to the pollution on 5 August, said the burn was showing signs of recovery.
Housing developments close to the burn include Culduthel Mains and Holm Dell.
A Sepa spokesperson said: "Sepa is satisfied that the problems at Knocknagael Stud Farm are now under control and is discussing with the operator what further remedial works might be needed.
"The burn affected by the incident is now showing signs of recovery."
The bull stud rents out its animals to crofters and farmers.
Knocknagael and adjoining Balrobert form the Scottish government's bull stud.
