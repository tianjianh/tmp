The Newport-based South Wales Argus saw the biggest drop, down 32.2% to an average of daily sale of 13,952 in the second half of 2013.
The figures came from the ABC, the organisation which measures newspaper circulation.
But some Welsh newspapers saw traffic to their websites rise by up to 35% as more people seek their news online.
The ABC figures showed that daily papers produced in Wales all saw sales fall in 2013:
However, some weekly papers saw their sales rise:
Other weekly papers did not fare so well:
The ABC has also published circulation details for smaller Welsh newspapers that only have their circulations audited every 12 months.
They include titles like the Glamorgan Gazette and the other "Celtic" weekly papers, and most of the other local weeklies around Wales.
The only one of these titles to record an increase in circulation was the Caerphilly, Ystrad Mynach & Bargoed Campaign with a 0.6% rise.
However, news websites have seen their users increase during 2013
Alongside its Wales Online and Daily Post websites, Trinity Mirror last year launched digital editions of its Western Mail, Daily Post and Wales on Sunday newspapers aimed at users of tablets and other mobile devices.
