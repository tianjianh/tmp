"Mindless" vandals have damaged headstones at a cemetery in Rhondda Cynon Taff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Wales Police has appealed for information after six graves in Ferndale were pushed over and broken.
PC Steve Davies said the "mindless act" had been committed by someone with "no concern for the emotional impact their behaviour will have on the families".
But he said the incident was not typical of the area.
PC Davies added: "We take these types of offences extremely seriously and will make every effort to find those responsible."
