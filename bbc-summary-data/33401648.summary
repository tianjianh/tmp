Police said the 28-year-old man was crossing the road on Bradshawgate,  opposite Yates's in the early hours when he was hit by a Vauxhall.
The victim is being treated for head and spinal injuries, a broken arm and cuts.
Sgt Brian Orr said: "The victim in this incident is lying seriously injured and the driver of the car that hit him didn't even have the decency to stop."
In Rochdale, a turning Vauxhall Vectra was involved in a collision with a Renault Clio on St Mary's Gate at about 05:15 BST.
A 23-year-old man in the Clio was seriously injured, with the vehicle's three other occupants fleeing the scene.
Sgt Paul Higgins said: "A young man has suffered very serious injuries as a result of this collision, and his three friends appear to have left him behind to deal with the consequences."
Police are appealing for witnesses to both incidents, which are not connected.
