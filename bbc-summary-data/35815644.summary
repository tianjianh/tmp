Comedian Russell Brand has urged people to sign a petition opposing the building of a new Thames Crossing.

Brand, 40, from Grays, Essex, posted a video on his Facebook page outlining why he is against the proposals.
Highways England said a new crossing was needed "to reduce congestion at the existing Dartford crossing and unlock economic growth".
Leader of Labour-controlled Thurrock Council, John Kent, welcomed the comments from "Grays lad" Mr Brand.
"Any publicity that makes the case that getting this new crossing will do nothing to ease congestion in Thurrock is a good thing," he said.
"There will be a new motorway through the green belt and more congestion."
In January, Highways England unveiled plans for a road tunnel connecting Tilbury and Gravesend in Kent.
In his YouTube video, Brand said his birthplace was "subject to a terrible, terrible plan" and described the proposals as a "very important local issue".
"I wouldn't have got involved but my auntie, my mum, lots of people who live in Grays, Chadwell, Tilbury are being negatively affected," he said.
He also expressed concern about air pollution, the destruction of new homes to make way for the crossing and the impact on a local school for children with learning difficulties.
"Small tiny battles like this, if won, communally, are a wonderful platform for us to advance on," he said.
The plans are facing opposition from some people in Thurrock and Gravesend, as well as Thurrock Council, which is campaigning alongside residents.
A petition has been asking the government to look into alternative locations for the new crossing "away from Thurrock".
It has so far attracted about 13,000 signatures, and will be debated in parliament if it reaches 100,000.
A consultation on options for a new Lower Thames Crossing is running until 24 March.
