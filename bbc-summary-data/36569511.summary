[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hosts France came from behind to beat the Republic of Ireland, who finished with 10 men, and reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2016.

The Republic got off to a stunning start, leading in the second minute, as Robbie Brady converted a penalty after Shane Long was fouled in the box.
But the French hit back through Antoine Griezmann, who nodded in the equaliser before driving in the winning goal.
Shane Duffy was then sent off for a professional foul on Griezmann.
Didier Deschamps' side will face England or Iceland in the next round at Stade de France on Sunday, 3 July (kick-off 20:00 BST).
However, defender Adil Rami and midfielder N'Golo Kante will miss the match through suspension, after picking up their second bookings of the tournament.

Striker Long had said before the match that his side were not motivated by "revenge" as the sides met for the first time since Thierry Henry's controversial handball led to the Republic's elimination in a World Cup qualifying play-off in 2009.
This was the Irish's first appearance in the knockout stages of the European Championship and their pocket of fans dressed in green at one corner of the stadium in Lyon responded with delight as Paul Pogba bundled over Southampton's Long and Brady converted the spot kick via a post.
It could have been worse for the French had Daryl Murphy's hooked shot not been tipped away by goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
But in the end, they did not have enough firepower up front, failing to hit the target thereafter and ending the tournament with just three goals from four matches.
Under increasing pressure in the second period, Martin O'Neill's defenders held out until the 58th minute, after which they crumbled.

The French had to regroup after their sloppy start, but showed they are capable of being real contenders if they cut out their mistakes.
Juventus midfielder Pogba was imposing following his early error, having more touches (91) and providing more passes (66) than any player on the field. At the back, centre-halves Rami and Laurent Koscielny were untroubled, while frontman Griezmann clinically took his chances.
The first was a powerful header from Bacary Sagna's cross and the second a composed finish into the bottom corner from Olivier Giroud's flick-on.
France should have had more goals, but Darren Randolph kept out further Griezmann efforts as well as a thumping strike from Blaise Matuidi. The Republic goalkeeper ended the match having made nine saves.
Les Bleus were booed off at half-time by their supporters, but they should know their team only come alive in the second half of matches, having now scored 11 of their past 12 European Championship goals in the second period.
The result in Paris was their first victory in the knockout stages of the Euros since their extra-time triumph over Italy in the final of Euro 2000.
Republic of Ireland defender Seamus Coleman: "We are just so disappointed at the minute. I suppose that shows how well we have done. I just felt like it was there for us today.
"Our fans were unbelievable and we'd love to go a bit further for them, but we hope we made people proud because our fans are amazing and everyone back home is amazing."
France forward Antoine Griezmann: "We struggled to get into the game and we still have a long way to go, so we will need to improve. But we are going to enjoy this and make the most of it.
"My family were in the stands as Lyon is basically my home town so that adds to it. I hope to be able to continue in this vein and to help the team."
