Arnold Palmer visits site of his first Scots course

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US golf legend Arnold Palmer has visited the site of his company's first golf course in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Arnold Palmer Group is collaborating with Castle Stuart Golf Links on the building of the course near Inverness.
It will complement the existing Castle Stuart course on the Moray Firth.
Palmer, 85, said: "When it comes to locations we'd like to work, Scotland has always been at the top of our list."
He added: "Needless to say the bar is set pretty high. Accordingly, we've been careful not to jump at the first opportunity to come along, deciding instead to wait on the right project."
It is understood the course could cost Â£5.5m to construct.
