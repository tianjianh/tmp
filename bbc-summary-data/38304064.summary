Lee Pettite, who was 22, was found on Oakley Walk, Eston in March, having staggered a short way.
Luke Lovell, 22, of Wilton Way, has been found guilty of his murder. Gordon Blue Smith, 23, of Laburnum Road was convicted of manslaughter.
Christopher Stubbs, 21, from South Bank, had already admitted murder. The men will be sentenced on Monday.
Lee Pettite's mother, Vanessa Prest, said his death had "totally destroyed" the family.
"I feel angry that he has been taken from us and I feel robbed of my chance to say goodbye - that is why there is no closure for me and the rest of my family," she said.
"I just can't see how I'll ever get over my son's death."
Cleveland Police said the Bankfields community in Eston had been "horrified by the violent murder of Lee Pettite in a park in broad daylight".
"Stubbs, Smith and Lovell have shown no remorse or compassion for their victim and they have made no attempt to fully account for their actions," Det Ch Insp Steve Young said.
He thanked witnesses who were "brave enough to come forward".
The incident was isolated and unusual for the area, he added.
