Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger says the Premier League title race is "far from being over" despite the eight-point gap between his side and leaders Leicester.

The Gunners have dropped eight points in three matches, including defeats by Manchester United and Swansea.
Saturday's 2-2 draw at Tottenham left them three points behind their second-placed rivals with nine games to play.
"We will not give up the Premier League, we will fight until the end," Wenger, 66, said.
"Just to remind you, we have beaten Leicester twice so we have done our job against them. People have to look at other teams more, not just us on that front.
"The Premier League is far from being over."

Arsenal are competing for three trophies, including the FA Cup and the Champions League, although they face an uphill battle in the latter following their 2-0 home defeat by Barcelona in the first leg of their last-16 tie.
They travel to Hull on Tuesday for a fifth-round replay in the FA Cup - a competition they have won for the past two seasons.
Wenger, who is in his 20th season as Arsenal boss, has been criticised during their recent poor run but he says he is unaffected.
"I believe that opinions are opinions," the Frenchman said. "I do my job and one day someone will replace me and will replace you.
"I try to do my best and leave this club in the best shape so the guy coming after me will have good potential to work with."
