Tara O'Reilly says her mother, Jackie Baker, 59, who has motor neurone disease, wants to die with dignity.
An online appeal has attracted money from 83 anonymous donors.
Assisting a suicide or suicide attempt is a criminal offence and Ms O'Reilly confirmed Dyfed-Powys Police had given her a warning.
Ms O'Reilly said £8,000 is needed to fund the trip and said she had no alternative but to ask for help.
She had organised a fundraising event, but it was cancelled after police warned her she could face prosecution.
Ms O'Reilly said: "I had a visit from the police saying if it went ahead I'd be in serious trouble.
"I just wanted to show my mother that I love her so much and I'm doing something.
"My mother has nothing. I'm sure anyone would do it for their parents or anyone they loved.
"My sister has put a page up for donations to help our mother with her daily needs and to make her more comfortable now.
"One person donated £2,000. I'm overwhelmed. We're a private family and to have the support we've had has been amazing.
"Donations have come from lots of people, doctors and lots of different people. A lot of them have gone through experiences themselves.
"My mother's wish will come true."
A person encouraging or assisting a suicide or suicide attempt could face up to 14 years in prison, if a decision was taken to prosecute.
