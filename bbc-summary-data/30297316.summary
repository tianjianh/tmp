Worcestershire pupils in £1m compensation payouts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than £1m was paid in compensation to school pupils in Worcestershire in 2013, a freedom of information request has shown.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Figures from the county council revealed six claims were made that year and a significant amount went to a middle school-aged pupil who fell during a school trip in 2009.
The council would not disclose further details for fear of identification.
Nothing has been paid to pupils so far in 2014, the figures showed.
A total of £1,091,082 was paid to pupils aged five to 18 between 2011 and 2013 - but the vast majority of that amount was paid in 2013, with the amounts for 2011 and 2012 being £3,850 and £47,450 respectively.
The accident resulting in the largest payout involved a pupil falling from a height and suffering a spinal injury at the Malvern Hills Outdoor Centre in June 2009, the Health and Safety Executive confirmed.
The centre was run by the council at the time.
The authority said 90% of all payouts were made by its insurance company.
