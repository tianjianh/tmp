Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland has confirmed he will miss Euro 2016 after fracturing his ankle in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Germany in Berlin.

Butland, 23, will have an operation on Tuesday after hurting himself moments before conceding Germany's opener.
The player was in tears as he was taken off on a stretcher and England manager Roy Hodgson described the injury as a "devastating blow" for the squad.
"I won't be able to be part of that experience now," said Butland.
Capped four times by his country, Butland has been ever present for Stoke in the Premier League this season.
The exact length of his recovery period is not yet known and Hodgson will name his squad for the European Championship finals, which begin in less than 11 weeks, on 12 May.
"I don't think [the European Championships are] going to be an option for me now to be honest because I won't be able to play again between now and the end of the season," he told the club's website.
"It is difficult because I have been working towards the Euros this summer.
"It isn't the challenge that I expected or wanted this summer but I am going to approach it with the right mentality and learn from it, both physically and mentally.
"I have not had to deal with an injury like this before so I will come out of it as a stronger person and a better goalkeeper, and look forward to the start of next season."
