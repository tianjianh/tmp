The 23-year-old was part of Euro 2016 quarter-finalists Iceland's squad but did not make an appearance in France.
Magnusson joined Juventus' academy in 2011 and has spent the past two years on loan at Italian side Cesena.
"He's very mobile, quick and smooth on the ball. He's 6ft 3in and has a great left foot," head coach Lee Johnson told Bristol City's club website.
"At the age of 23 has plenty of time to mature as a player."
Chief operating officer Mark Ashton added: "It's been a real team effort from a number of people at the club to get this deal done and I look forward to welcoming him to Ashton Gate."
Magnusson becomes City's fourth signing of the summer so far, joining forward Lee Tomlin, plus midfielders Gary O'Neil and Josh Brownhill.
