Northern rail confirmed "an incident took place at Preston station shortly before 15:00 GMT and "a very small number of people have been injured".
Mark Ormerod, who was standing on a platform opposite, said the train "didn't seem to slow enough" and made "a very loud bang" as it hit.
"A full investigation will be carried out," a Northern spokeswoman said.
Mr Ormerod, 19, from Preston, said the 14.47 GMT train from York was pulling into platform 3C.
"I was looking as I could tell it was going to hit... I couldn't see the passengers but saw the driver did jump when the train collided", he said.
"One passenger limped off and one was holding her broken glasses", he added.
British Transport Police said some passengers "had received minor injuries and were seen to by paramedics [from] the local ambulance service."
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch "will be carrying out preliminary examinations," a spokeswoman added.
