The mother of a seven-year-old girl with a life-threatening lung disease has said pioneering surgery has changed her daughter's life.

Katie Parke was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis as a toddler. It means deposits build up in the lungs making it hard to breathe.
A 3D printed windpipe was used by doctors to practice delicate surgery before an operation to clean her lungs.
Sharon Parke said Katie was now able to live a relatively normal life.
"I think because Katie has such a fighting spirit you take it day by day and its just life," she said.
"We don't dwell on how sick she is because she pulls through each time."
The Londonderry girl is now back in school taking part in PE class for the first time.
Everyday activities such as running and jumping were all things she was unable to do before the operation.
The new technique was developed by a team of doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.
Katie will continue to make regular trips to the hospital to have her lungs cleaned.
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis requires regular washing of the lungs with saltwater to remove the deposits.
According to research by the team, there are only three children worldwide that have the disease.
Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Ms Parke explained how her daughter was first diagnosed.
"When Katie was three and a half she took severe pneumonia and they couldn't get her off the oxygen so they sent her for further investigation up at the Royal.
"They diagnosed that her and at the time the signs weren't good for Katie because she was in such poor health."
She said surgeons had ever worked on someone so young or so small.
"They found it very hard to get the right tubing's and pipes to fit Katie's throat," Ms Parke said.
"To put Katie under anaesthetic, there's always a risk she won't pull through.
"They were able to make a trachea perfectly proportioned to Katie's, which meant prior to operations, they were able to work with different tubing to fit her trachea and that saved a lot of time in surgery."
During Katie's operation, one of her lungs needed to be ventilated while the other was cleaned.
The technology meant that Katie spent less time under anaesthetic and being ventilated.
Shirley McKenna, the principal of Glendermott Primary School in Derry, said Katie was an inspiration.
"For her grit, her determination in how she's faced the challenges in life, she's an absolute credit to us as a school and her family.
"She's an amazing wee girl."
