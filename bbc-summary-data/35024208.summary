British fighter Jade Jones won bronze at the World Taekwondo Grand Final as team-mate Bianca Walkden secured Team GB another spot at next year's Rio Olympics.

Jones, 22, beat Swede Nikita Glasnovic in the third-place fight-off in Mexico.
The London 2012 gold medallist had already secured a -57kg place for Britain at Rio 2016.
Walkden lost in the quarter-finals, but earned enough points to guarantee Britain an Olympic +67kg berth.
The season-ending event in Mexico City was the last opportunity for fighters to secure the top-six world ranking that would secure their nation a Rio place - something Briton Lutalo Muhammad achieved with -80kg victory on Saturday.
Earlier this year, many in the sport thought Walkden would struggle to qualify having suffered a serious knee-ligament injury in 2014.
However, the European champion won the World Championship in May and climbed to world number two after Grand Prix success.
"Even though I lost today I still had a wonderful year," Walkden wrote on her Facebook page.
The 24-year-old, who lost to China's Shuyin Zheng on golden point, added: "On to the next year! Bring it on!"
Team GB are guaranteed places for three athletes at Rio 2016, one in each of the -57kg (female), +67kg (female) and -80kg (male) divisions.
GB Taekwondo will be able to send one additional fighter, to claim a maximum fourth berth, to the European Olympic qualification event in Istanbul in January.
Ivory Coast-born heavyweight Mahama Cho is the favourite to be given that opportunity, with the decision set to be revealed before Christmas.
Only once selectors know how many places fighters have attained will they consider nominating athletes for the Olympic squad.
While Jones and Walkden are the overwhelming favourites for their divisions, the -80kg place could go to either London 2012 bronze medallist Muhammad or world silver medallist Damon Sansum.
