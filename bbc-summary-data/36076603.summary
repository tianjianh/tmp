Olimpija Ljubljana coach Marko Nikolic has agreed to leave the Slovenian leaders a week after he racially abused one of his own players.

A video showed Nikolic, 36, calling Blessing Eleke a "black idiot" after he felt the Nigerian, 20, spent too long celebrating an equaliser.
The club initially refused to suspend the Serb, but the Slovenian FA banned him for seven games for "clear racism".
"He made a mistake and had to pay for it," chairman Milan Mandaric said.
"We have reached an agreement with Marko for him to resign as coach. He is a good coach, a good man," added the former Portsmouth, Leicester and Sheffield Wednesday owner.
Olimpija, who are two points clear in the Slovenian top flight, appointed Nikolic earlier this year after he was sacked by Partizan Belgrade in his homeland in 2015.
They drew 1-1 against Zavrc on 10 April thanks to Eleke's first home goal for the club following his January move from league rivals Gorica.
Nikolic said he made "an emotional reaction" as Eleke's celebration meant there was less time for a winner and "never intended to offend the player racially".
