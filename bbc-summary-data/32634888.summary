In Glasgow, officers said they were looking into one case of "personation".
A similar allegation involving a vote cast at a polling station in the Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East constituency was also being probed.
Claims of personation in two Edinburgh constituencies - South and South West - have also been reported.
The Glasgow case was believed to have involved someone entering a polling station in the Glasgow East constituency and crossing a ballot paper under another person's name.
The presiding officer informed authorities earlier and counting staff were asked to be on the lookout for the paper when the box arrived at the Emirates Arena count.
Glasgow City Council said count staff would wear blue gloves to locate the paper, which will be counted and sealed in a bag before being handed to police.
At the North Lanarkshire count in Motherwell, a statement from the returning officer Gavin Whitefield said: "Following an allegation of personation at a polling station in the Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East constituency, the police are investigating.
"We will verify the ballot box in question in isolation to help to provide evidence for the police inquiry. No other polling stations or ballot boxes are affected."
At the Edinburgh count, candidates from Edinburgh South and Edinburgh South West constituencies were summoned to a meeting.
An Edinburgh City Council spokesman said: "Polling staff raised concern over two possible cases of voter personation. This was immediately reported to Police Scotland who are now investigating."
It is understood cases refer to one ballot paper in Gorgie Dalry parish church in Edinburgh South West, and one ballot paper in Edinburgh South neighbourhood office in Edinburgh South.
