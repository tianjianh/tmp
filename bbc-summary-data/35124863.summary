The new Star Wars movie has inspired the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's (SFRS) latest online safety message.

Drawing on the film's famous droid R2-D2 and Death Star, the service hopes to bring people's attention to the use of smoke alarms in their homes.
SFRS North media officer Duncan McKenzie came up with the idea and colleague Gail Gleeson did the artwork.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens opened earlier in UK cinemas.
The film includes members of the original cast, such as Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, as well as newcomers Daisy Ridley and John Boyega.
Mr McKenzie said: "We are constantly trying to come up with new ideas to grab people's attention and we have a lot of talented people in the corporate communications team who come up with various ideas throughout the year."
The Star Wars-themed messages aim to encourage people to have smoke alarms fitted in their home, and to make sure that those already installed work properly.
