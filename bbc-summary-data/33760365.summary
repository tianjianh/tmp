[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The cost of rural crime in Gloucestershire has risen, according to new figures.

County claims to insurance firm NFU Mutual totalled nearly Â£600,000 in 2014, up from Â£408,000 the year before.
Livestock was one of the main targets with claims for 191 stolen animals, including sheep, cattle and pheasants.
More than a third of claims were made for stolen tools. Equine-related equipment, bikes and fuel were the other most-stolen items.
Gloucestershire's National Farmers' Union chairman, Tanya Robbins, said the figures should be a "wake-up call".
"We obviously need to be more vigilant," she told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
But, she added, some thieves would go to "elaborate lengths" to steal highly-guarded items like quad bikes.
Gloucestershire's rural crime officer, Sergeant Simon Clemett, said the force had improved the way it tackled rural crime "considerably" in recent years with more than 30 specialist officers now working on the issue.
He added: "We're also working with other forces across borders to ensure we adopt good practice and clamp down on those criminal groups who try to exploit the outlying areas of our counties."
