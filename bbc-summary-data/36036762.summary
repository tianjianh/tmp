Hughes and Ben Slater put on 103 for the first wicket before Slater was caught off the bowling of Liam Norwell.
Madsen (58) and Hughes put on 71 to steady the innings after Norwell had Hamish Rutherford (1) caught behind.
Jack Taylor bowled Hughes to end his 206-ball knock, but Madsen remained unbeaten alongside Neil Broom (30) as the visitors reached 242-3 at stumps.
BBC Radio Gloucestershire's Bob Hunt at Bristol:
"Not the most exhilarating day's cricket, but both teams will feel reasonably satisfied with their work.
"After a first session where no wickets fell and 96 runs were scored, the visitors were setting their sights on a healthy total by the close but tight bowling slowed them down in a rather turgid afternoon.
"Liam Norwell picked up two wickets immediately after lunch, Wayne Madsen took his time to get going and only 45 runs came off 32 overs.
"Chesney Hughes had batted with discipline to get within four of his century, but inexplicably missed a long hop from Jack Taylor.
"If Gloucestershire get early wickets tomorrow then they will feel they are still very much in the game."
