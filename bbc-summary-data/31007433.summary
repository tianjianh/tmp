General Election 2015: South East MPs' seats under threat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's now 100 days until the general election and our opportunity to choose who forms the next government.

It promises to be the most unpredictable election for decades, with no party looking like it will win outright.
Of course, some constituencies will be more exciting than others.
In Kent, all eyes will be on South Thanet, where the UKIP leader Nigel Farage has chosen to stand in his fourth attempt at becoming an MP.
He stood there in 2005 but won only 5% of the votes.
The political landscape has changed dramatically over the last decade though - UKIP is now seen as one of the main parties after topping the polls at the European elections and enjoying a lot of success in the local elections.
South Thanet is currently held by Conservative MP Laura Sandys, with a majority of 7,617.
She announced in November 2013 that she would be stepping down at the 2015 general election.
The seat is being fought for the Conservatives by Craig McKinlay - a former UKIP leader - putting him head-to-head with his former party leader.
Another key battle for UKIP will be Rochester and Strood. It's one of only two UKIP-held seats at Westminster. Conservative candidate Mark Reckless won the seat in 2010 with a majority of 9,953 but he defected to UKIP in September 2014, triggering a by-election.
The Prime Minister pledged "to throw the kitchen sink" at the seat but despite five visits from the PM, along with half the cabinet, the Tories couldn't retain it.
Mark Reckless won it for UKIP but with a much reduced majority of 2,920. The Conservatives say they're determined to win it back in May. If they do it would be a huge blow for UKIP.
Crawley is another constituency that will be hotly contested. It's a key Labour target seat but the Conservative MP Henry Smith will be very keen to hold on to it. At the local and European elections Crawley was inundated with big hitters including Labour's Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, and the then Conservative foreign secretary William Hague.
There are several marginal constituencies in Sussex that the Tories are determined to hold on to and Labour is equally determined to win.
Hastings and Rye is held by the energy minister and Tory MP, Amber Rudd, with a majority of less than 2,000. She faces a tough challenge from the Labour candidate Sarah Owen.
The Brighton Kemptown seat held by the Conservative Simon Kirby also looks vulnerable - he has a majority of just 1,328.
Brighton Pavilion is also held with a slim majority of just 1,252. It was won by the UK's only Green MP, and then party leader, Caroline Lucas in 2010. She later stood down as the Green's leader.
Brighton also elected the first Green-led council in the UK, but it has been beset by problems including a long running bin-workers strike and a vote of no confidence in the council's leader. It's a key target seat for Labour who will be hoping that the negative council headlines may impact on Caroline Lucas' vote.
The Hove and Portslade MP Mike Weatherley, who also has a majority of under 2,000, has announced that he will be standing down at the next election.
All of the Sussex seats mentioned above were held by Labour before 2010 and the party hopes that come 7 May it can roll back the tide of blue and start winning back in the South East.
As for the Liberal Democrats, many are predicting an election wipe-out. They currently have two seats in the South East.
Norman Baker has held Lewes since 1997. He has a majority of over 7,500 but, he knows he has a fight on his hands to retain the seat and many believe he resigned from his position as Home Office minister in order to be able to spend more time in his constituency ahead of the election.
The seat was held by the Conservatives before 1997 and they would love to win it back.
In Eastbourne, Stephen Lloyd beat the incumbent Tory candidate Nigel Waterson to take the seat with a majority of 3,435. He knows he will have a battle on his hands to retain the seat.
No sooner had Eastbourne Pier been burnt down than the Prime Minister David Cameron and chancellor George Osborne made a joint visit to the town pledging financial support.
What's clear is in the forthcoming election battle is that the coalition handcuffs are off and each party will be out for itself.
There's no doubt politics has become more fragmented in recent years ending the old two-party-system.
The public have also become more cynical about politics, more apathetic and feel that their votes don't matter.
Given how tight this election promises to be, I think that this time every vote will matter because no-one can predict the outcome of May's general election.
