'Slab' Murphy: NUJ call on police to investigate incident at polling station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has called on Irish police to investigate after it claimed journalists and photographers were intimidated while assembling to photograph Thomas 'Slab' Murphy leaving a polling station in County Louth.

SÃ©amus Dooley, NUJ Irish secretary, said it happened at Hackballscross shortly after 09:00 GMT on Friday.
Mr Dooley said the intimidation of photographers and reporters by associates of Mr Murphy was "an affront to democracy".
"I understand that shortly after 9am a car with four occupants, including Mr Murphy, the front seat passenger, arrived at Shelagh National School, Hackballscross," Mr Dooley said.
"Mr Murphy was not impeded from entering the building and there was no attempt by any media representative to prevent him from casting his vote in secret.
"As he entered the polling station, one of the occupants of the car approached a vehicle in which a photographer and reporter were sitting.
"The man did not identify himself but ordered the media representatives that they could not take photographers.  I note that according to a report in The Irish Times the man told the journalists he was 'just following orders'.
"We understand that as a garda (Irish police officer) and an election official subsequently spoke to the media the man proceeded to take photographs of the journalists and their cars.
"The NUJ deplores this attempt to intimidate journalists in the course of their work in reporting on a significant event."
Mr Dooley said Mr Murphy was a figure of current public interest as he was due to be sentenced later on Friday on tax evasion charges at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin.
Mr Dooley added: "If Mr Murphy felt his rights were being violated he should have reported the matter to An Garda SiochÃ¡na.
"The use of private handlers to try to control the media is unacceptable in a democracy."
