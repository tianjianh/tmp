The tie is level at 1-1 after Saturday's first leg and Reading will hope to exploit home advantage.
"There's still a long way to go," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "We'll still need to be focused on what will be a very tough game at home.
"It's about having the belief in ourselves and the will to win."
Reading will be without captain Paul McShane on Tuesday following his red card in Saturday's first leg.
Their goalscorer at Craven Cottage, Jordan Obita, may also miss out after the left-back was carried off on a stretcher with an ankle injury at full-time.
"We're happy with the draw and we're going into a home game, which is good," Stam said.
"But, we've always talked about experience and what experienced players can do for the team and that's going to be key. Are they willing to do everything in their power to get that result?
"By doing that and trusting in their abilities to get a result, that's what has worked for us throughout this season."
