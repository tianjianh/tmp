The Wallaby, 28, has not recovered from a hamstring injury picked up in their semi-final victory over Leicester.
Willie Le Roux switches to full-back, with Josh Bassett, who scored the winning try against the Tigers, starting on the wing.
Exeter make one change to the starting XV which overcame Saracens, with wing Olly Woodburn replacing James Short.
Short is Exeter's top try-scorer this season, having scored 11 tries in the Premiership, 14 times in all competitions.

Pace-setters all season, Wasps have been the great entertainers of the campaign, scoring tries at will and playing a brilliant brand of rugby.
However, their set-piece fell apart against Leicester - this area is one of the Chiefs' strengths - and if Wasps don't win enough good quality ball they will lose. Conversely, if their scrum and line-out does function, they have the tools to blow any team away.
Both clubs thoroughly deserve to be here, having finished in the top two and having showed remarkable composure under pressure to edge their semi-finals. They actually met on round one of the Premiership - Wasps edged it that day - so the league has come full circle.
But, while Wasps may have slightly tailed away at the back end of the season, Exeter have been on an upward curve. This may be decisive.
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:
"We've got to make sure we leave the semi-final behind. The big thing is, with a semi-final that was that good a game, won in such a manner and was such a thriller for everybody who was there, sometimes it gets hard to leave it behind - you've got to move on.
"We're actually probably a stronger group going into the final than we were last week, which is always nice. There's a larger playing group who've had more time training and more time to return from injury.
"We've got to make sure that we don't expect that having a bit of experience from last year will be that big a factor. We've got to demand that what the big factor is, is the quality we play at."
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"The final is new territory for this group of players, but really exciting territory. But, as much as we are going to enjoy the day, we want more than that.
"We are not there to make up the numbers. We are there to give absolutely everything we have to try to win the trophy. Saturday is about more than the matchday 23 lucky enough to wear the shirt. It will be about every player who has played their part this season to get us to Twickenham.
"We have a lot of respect for Exeter Chiefs, who are a quality team and a quality club. We've had some memorable battles over the past couple of seasons and know how well drilled and coached they are, so we will have to be at our absolute best to win. Produce our best and I know we are a match for anyone."
