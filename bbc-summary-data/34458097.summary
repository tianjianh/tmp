They are more familiar with recycling the ball than rubbish but five rugby players took a break from the pitch to collect refuse in Neath Port Talbot.

Ospreys players Olly Cracknell, De Kock Steenkamp, Dan Baker, Dafydd Howells and Sam Parry joined collectors in Baglan Moors on Tuesday.
The players said it was to show their commitment to the "Ospreylian community".
Last week they took part in collections in Swansea and Bridgend.
Cracknell said: "It was an early start but a great work-out for us this morning.
"A huge thanks to the recycling teams for showing us the ropes, they do a great job every day and we've enjoyed getting involved and giving a hand."
