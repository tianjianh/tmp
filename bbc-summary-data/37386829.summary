De Laet, 27, who signed from Leicester City in August, went off in the 67th minute of Villa's 1-1 draw against Brentford on Wednesday.
"We will have to make more assessments with him, but it looks right now like he will need surgery," Di Matteo said.
"We need to see what damage he has on the knee. He will be out for a while."
