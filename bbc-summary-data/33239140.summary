[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of trying to murder a trainee dentist in an apparent race revenge attack "acted like a lunatic" as he hacked his victim with a machete in a supermarket, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Sarandev Bhambra was set upon by 26-year-old Zack Davies with a hammer and machete in Tesco in Mold, Flintshire.
Mold Crown Court previously heard it was a revenge attack for the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby.
Mr Davies, of Mold, denies attempted murder but admits wounding with intent.
Dr Bhambra was walking down an aisle in the store on 14 January when Mr Davies attacked him.
Shopper Leanne Jones said she heard the words "white power" and said Mr Davies "started to act like a lunatic and raised the machete above his head... he was striking him as hard as he could."
In a statement read to the court, another witness described hearing the words "white power" and "come here, this is for Lee Rigby".
Another woman, who was shopping with her four-year-old daughter, said: "He was shouting 'justice for the whites' as he was hacking with the machete... he was constantly striking on the Asian man's back."
She said Dr Bhambra had panic in his face and she thought he was "running for his life."
The court heard Dr Bhambra suffered two lacerations to his scalp which went down to the bone and a cut to his back which went down to the muscle.
The injury to his left hand caused major nerve, artery and tendon damage and he was in surgery for five hours.
Mr Davies told police: "It was me. I did it for Lee Rigby."
While being interviewed by police, Mr Davies said jihadi violence, the terror attacks in France and the murder of Lee Rigby were all on his mind.
He told officers he hoped his victim was "not seriously injured" but said he had harboured violent thoughts for more than a decade.
"Since I was 15 I have carried a knife every day and had thoughts of attacking people. Since I was 11 I have been holding back the violence" he told officers.
"It was a moment of madness, up to today I have been able to control these urges," he added.
Mr Davies said Dr Bhambra's religion was irrelevant, adding: "It was his appearance, just the way he looked... it was his racial appearance.
"Young white girls abused by Asians - that was also in the back of my mind."
Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were jailed for life in February 2014 for hacking Fusilier Rigby to death.
The trial continues.
