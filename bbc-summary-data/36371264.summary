Russell remains under observation in hospital following a clash of heads in the opening minute of Saturday's defeat at Connacht in the Pro12 semi-final.
Warriors say Russell's condition has "improved significantly" and that surgery is not required.
Scotland, who play two Tests in Japan, are yet to announce a squad replacement for the 23-year-old.
The squad will gather for a training camp on 6 June before their departure for Tokyo five days later.
The Tests on 18 and 25 June will be shown live on BBC Scotland, with coverage also provided by BBC Radio Scotland and the BBC Sport website.
Ruaridh Jackson is the only other specialist stand-off in Vern Cotter's squad, although centre Peter Horne can cover number 10.
Last week, winger Tim Visser withdrew from the travelling party due to a knee injury, with Sean Lamont called up in his place.
