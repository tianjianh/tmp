Meet some of Ted Cruz's harshest critics - Republicans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has endured his fair share of criticism - from fellow politicians to his former university flatmate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
People have called the Texas senator "abrasive", "creepy" and "arrogant".
Despite alienating many people he has encountered throughout his life and career, he may be the only realistic Republican alternative to Donald Trump.
He has won 10 state contests and has millions of devoted supporters across the county.
However, Mr Cruz himself acknowledged he may not be the most beloved politician. "If you want someone to grab a beer with, I may not be that guy," he said in October.
Here are 10 of his most prominent - and passionate - detractors:
Former House speaker and an Ohio Republican
"I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life."
Republican senator from South Carolina
"If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you." Mr Graham now grudgingly supports Mr Cruz's presidential bid.
Republican congressman from New York
"I hate Ted Cruz, and I think I'll take cyanide if he ever got the nomination." He later told CNN that he would not actually kill himself.
Former roommate at Princeton University; now a Hollywood screenwriter
"I would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States. Anyone. I would rather pick somebody from the phone book."
Republican presidential candidate
"He's a nasty guy. Nobody likes him. Nobody in Congress likes him. Nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him."
Conservative media personality and Trump supporter
"Just look at Cruz's face: it's got career scum politician, aka liar, written all over it."
Republican senator from Arizona
"You know, it's always the wacko birds ... that get the media megaphone," he said referring to Mr Cruz and others. Mr McCain has also cast doubt on whether the Canadian-born Cruz was eligible to be president.
Former Republican congressional aide
"Cruz is an army of one, alienating anybody who is in his path. He advocates losing strategies purely to further his own career at the expense of the party."
Former Republican senator from Kansas
Speaking on the presidential race: "We need somebody with experience and there are a lot of good candidates - I like nearly all of them. Except Cruz."
Former Republican president; Mr Cruz worked on his staff during his 2000 campaign
"I just don't like the guy," the fellow Texan told Republican donors privately in October.
Of course, not everyone hates Mr Cruz. Here are some nice things people had to say about him:
Paul Ryan:
Asked about Mr Boehner's comments, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he has a much better relationship with Mr Cruz.
"I have a very good relationship with both of these men, and I'm going to keep it that way," he said.
Heidi Cruz:
The former Goldman Sachs executive told Fox News of her husband: "Ted has a very rare combination that I spotted immediately, which is that he has a deep, deep intelligence, but at the same time, he's a lot of fun."
Carly Fiorina:
Ms Fiorina has had positive things to say about Mr Cruz since she dropped out of the presidential race - and especially now that she has agreed to be his running-mate should he earn the Republican nomination.
"I know the Ted Cruz the media won't tell you aboutâ€”the loving father, the devoted husband, the movie buff," she said. "Ted Cruz is a constitutional conservative who has made enemies in both partiesâ€”because he's dared to stand up to bipartisan corruption in Washington."
