Judges previously announced include BBC 6 Music presenter and former Mercury winner Jarvis Cocker, poet and rapper Kate Tempest, jazz musician Jamie Cullum and Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac.
The final panel also includes several music journalists and editors.
A longlist of 12 contenders for album of the year will be revealed at a live launch in London on 4 August.
The event will be hosted by BBC Radio 6 Music's Shaun Keaveny.
"Each year the albums of the year highlight some of the best in British and Irish talent - and 2016 is already shaping up to be a brilliant year for music," said Keaveny.
"It's going to be a tough decision for the judges, so I'm glad I'm not one of them! I'm really looking forward to finding out this year's shortlist."
Keaveny's fellow 6 Music presenter Lauren Laverne will reveal the list live on the station simultaneously at 11:00 BST.
An online poll will then take place, which, for the first time, will enable music fans to select the first of six 2016 finalists from the original 12 albums on the longlist.
The five remaining finalists and overall winner will all be chosen by the Mercury Prize judging panel.
The six shortlisted albums and the winner of the Â£20,000 prize will be announced on 15 September at the Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, west London.
Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK digital release date between 26 September 2015 and 29 July 2016 are eligible to enter.
The ceremony will be shown live on BBC Four and broadcast on 6 Music.
Last year's winner was Benjamin Clementine for his debut album At Least For Now.
