The 22-year-old came in to the race as favourite and produced a strong performance to win in a time of 13.05 seconds.
Spain's Orlando Ortega won silver in 13.17, with France's Dimitri Bascou taking bronze in 13.24.
Britons Andrew Pozzi and Lawrence Clarke both failed to reach the final, with the former describing his performance as "abysmal".
Pozzi struggled in his semi-final, clocking 13.67 before being disqualified.
The 24-year-old told BBC Sport: "Straight from the blocks I started hammering the first couple of hurdles.
"I can't put my finger on why, I just felt out of sorts.
"It's terrible viewing and I can only apologise."
Clarke, 26, finished sixth in his semi-final in 13.46 and said he would "probably have to get a proper job now".
