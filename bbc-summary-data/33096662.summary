Wildlife appear to have had a "lucky escape" after 50,000 litres of fuel leaked into the Grand Union Canal, the Canal and River Trust said.

A criminal probe was launched after a pipe going over the canal at Gayton Marina, Northamptonshire, was drilled into at the weekend.
A charity spokeswoman said the fuel had mostly sat on the surface of the water and had since been sucked out.
The Environment Agency said four fish died but the full impact was not known.
The canal has since reopened to boaters.
The leak happened in the early hours of Saturday in what is believed to be a botched theft. Ten people sleeping on houseboats had to be checked over by paramedics for breathing in fumes.
A Canal and River Trust spokeswoman said when the pipe was pierced the fuel, believed to be used for aviation, spewed out like a "jet washer" due to the high pressure, making it hard for anyone to steal.
She said little wildlife impact had been reported as the fuel mostly sat in pools of a few centimetres in depth on the water's surface, and it appeared it had not seeped significantly down into the river bed.
An Environment Agency spokeswoman said the clean-up was complete and only four fish had washed up dead.
A statement added: "Initial findings suggest that there has been some impact on the invertebrate and further information is limited due to the ongoing investigation on the effect of the pollution."
Northamptonshire Police said its investigation was ongoing.
