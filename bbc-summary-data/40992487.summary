Cameron Russell, 20, from Dalry in Ayrshire, died after an incident in Sunny Beach, near the Black Sea, on Thursday.
The company he worked for has posted a tribute to him on social media describing his death as a "tragic accident".
The Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British man who died in Sunny Beach.
The 20-year-old was a digger driver for plant hire and industrial services firm Clearwater Ltd.
In a statement posted on Facebook, it said: "It's with great sadness I have to tell everyone that we lost one of our young digger drivers after a tragic accident on holiday.
"Cameron 'Buff' Russell started with the company three years ago and just turned 20 a few weeks ago.
"He was a credit to the company and his mother and father. RIP young Cammy, you will be sorely missed."
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "The British Embassy in Bulgaria is providing assistance to the family of a British man who has died in Sunny Beach."
