An investigation has been launched after pictures of inmates with smuggled steaks and fish and chip takeaways were posted online.

The photographs seem to have been taken on an illegally-possessed mobile phone inside HMP Guys Marsh near Shaftesbury.
The photos, which also appear to depict drug possession, were posted on social media profiles which have since been suspended.
A Prison Service spokesperson called the images "unacceptable".
The spokesperson said: "We will be referring this matter to the police for investigation and have had the social media profiles removed.
"We are stepping up measures to find and block mobile phones in prisons and those found with them face extra time behind bars."
It is believed that four of the six prisoners who were pictured in the social media posts have been moved to other jails from the Category C training prison.
North Dorset MP Simon Hoare said the reports were "very concerning".
He said: "We have to make sure order and good governance in the prison is maintained and restored as soon as possible."
Dorset Police confirmed it had received a report of illegal possession of a mobile phone in prison.
A spokeswoman said: "Dorset Police is aware of recent media reports concerning HMP Guys Marsh. We work closely with the governor and staff to ensure that allegations of crime are dealt with appropriately."
Using a mobile phone in prison currently carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison.
