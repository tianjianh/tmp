The driver of an uninsured Lamborghini seized outside a police station could avoid court action by accepting a fine and penalty points, police have said.

The sports car was towed away after it was stopped outside a police station in Cambridge in August.
The Huracan model was pulled over by Cambridgeshire police close to its Parkside base.
Police said the company that hired out of the vehicle was "not at fault" and would not face any penalty.
In a Freedom of Information response on 26 November, Cambridgeshire police said the driver had been reported for a "traffic offence" that had yet to be finalised.
A Cambridgeshire Police spokesman confirmed the driver had now been offered the chance to accept a Â£100 fine for driving without a front number plate, plus a Â£300 fine and six penalty points for having no insurance.
If the driver refuses to accept the penalty, the case could be taken to court.
In a tweet at the time of the offence, Cambridgeshire's roads policing unit said: "Even Lamborghinis need insurance." It added: "He was stopped outside the station!"
The vehicle, which retails from about Â£180,000, was later collected by the hire firm.
