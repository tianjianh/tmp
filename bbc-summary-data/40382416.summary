He performed in Hacienda Classical with Mike Pickering and Manchester Camerata.
It is a new spin on Manchester club scene music from the 1980s as both had worked as DJs at the Hacienda at that time.
After the gig, Park tweeted it was an "amazing" experience.
Paul Davies, from Manchester Camerata, tweeted it had been a "proud, proud moment".
