[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a multimillion-pound light show in County Durham have been given the final go-ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Eleven Arches project will feature open-air light shows and historical re-enactments in the grounds of Auckland Castle, Bishop Auckland from 2016.
Durham County Council's licensing sub-committee granted the licence despite concerns about noise.
The Eleven Arches Trust which is behind the proposals, said the shows would not cause an "unacceptable level of noise"
Businessman Jonathan Ruffer - whose donation saved Auckland Castle - is behind the project, which aims to attract 800,000 visitors a year, create jobs and boost the economy.
The licence allows the trust to stage 15 outdoor performances in 2016, with an aim of reaching a maximum of 18 from 2018 onwards.
The trust said it had addressed "potential concerns" and had agreed to a set of conditions for the shows.
Performances will be based on Puy du Fou, a historical theme park, which has been running in France since 1978.
