One of India's most popular anonymous Twitter accounts, Lutyens Insider, is in trouble.

A woman journalist filed a police complaint against the account after a series of tweets about her and Congress party vice president Rahul Gandhi.
Swati Chaturvedi wrote about her decision saying, "I decided that I will do, what we as the media, keep prescribing to others ??? take action."
Lutyens Insider has since deleted the tweets and changed the account name.
Ms Chaturvedi who tweets under the handle @bainjal took action after Lutyens Insider alleged that she had an affair with Mr Gandhi.
She has received a groundswell of social media support for her decision to tackle the account head on.
Among her cheerleaders are prominent Indian women journalists like NDTV's Barkha Dutt and Times of India's consulting editor Sagarika Ghose.
Former Chief Minister of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir, Omar Abdullah, also tweeted in support.
The action against Lutyens Insider also generated much discussion among India's Twitter community, including from other anonymous accounts.
Indian media reported that following the police complaint, the name of the handle was changed to @gregoryzackim, with the only indication that it was the same handle being that it had retained its 40.6k followers.
These include a number of prominent journalists and editors, as well as Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
A new Lutyens Insider account has also surfaced on Twitter, but with significantly fewer followers (115) and tweets (15).
Lutyens Insider is one among a series of Lutyens-themed anonymous gossip accounts which tweet out unverified information about India's power elite.
These accounts created a massive buzz in India's social media space, and their tweets are often re-tweeted dozens of times.
However some journalists have been apprehensive about their content.
Madhu Trehan, editor of media website newslaundry.com,  told the BBC in November 2014: "There is an unwritten rule in Indian journalism that we stay away from politicians' personal lives. But what these accounts are doing is just gossip. They are posting just anything."
The names of the other accounts are Lutyens Masala and Lutyens Spice.
Lutyens is an area in India's capital which was designed by British architect Edwin Lutyens in the 1920s. It houses India's parliament, central administrative blocks and the presidential palace.
There has been much speculation over who runs the accounts, but no one has come forward and claimed ownership.
With Ms Chaturvedi asserting that Delhi police are "hot on the trail" of the owner of the handle, India may soon find out.
