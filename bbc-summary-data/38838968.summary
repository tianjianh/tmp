The BBC Trust, the corporation's governing body, upheld complaints about the programme Lies, Laws and the Bin Lorry Tragedy, broadcast in 2015.
The half-hour film looked at the decision not to prosecute driver Harry Clarke over the December 2014 crash.
The complaints were brought by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS).
A spokeswoman said: "We raised a complaint about the BBC's failure to accurately report our position and we note that the BBC Trust has now accepted that was the case."
BBC Scotland said it disagreed with the BBC Trust's decision. It said it "took great care to make sure the programme was fair to the Crown Office".
Mr Clarke, 58, was unconscious when the Glasgow City Council bin lorry veered out of control on 22 December 2014, killing six people and injuring 17 others.
It later emerged that Mr Clarke had a history of blackouts that he failed to disclose to his employer.

In the BBC programme, broadcast in November 2015, two families questioned whether the Crown Office was aware of all the evidence when they made the decision not to prosecute.
The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service complained to the BBC Trust on five points.

While upholding all three complaints against BBC Scotland, the Trust said "the documentary was a thoughtful piece of programme-making made in the public interest".
The complaints were:
There were two complaints about the Jeremy Vine show:
A BBC Scotland spokesman said: "While we appreciate the consideration given throughout this process, we disagree with the BBC Trust's decision to uphold these elements of the complaint.
"BBC Scotland made considerable efforts to ensure that the programme's journalism was robust, fair and accurate and accorded in full with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines.
"The testimony provided to us by the victims' families was compelling. We remain convinced of its veracity and we took great care to make sure the programme was fair to the Crown Office."
