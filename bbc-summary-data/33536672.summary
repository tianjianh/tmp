[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unemployment in Northern Ireland has risen for the first time in 28 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two hundred more people claimed jobseekers allowance in June according to a Labour Market Report from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.
While figures were up slightly in June, in the year as a whole unemployment has fallen by more than 10,000.
The total number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits in Northern Ireland stood at 44,000.
The other unemployment measure, the Labour Force Survey, rose to 6.2%.
This is above the UK average of 5.6%.
More people are leaving the labour market in the form of the economically inactive - groups like students, those who are sick or disabled.
That figure has also increased slightly to more than 27%, the highest rate in the UK.
The figures also suggest that the number of people employed in the public sector is beginning to fall.
Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell said: "Although unemployment measures show an increase over the most recent period, the levels and rates remain below those recorded a year ago.
"The latest figures highlight the continued challenges faced by the Northern Ireland labour market and the impact of continued uncertainty in global markets.
"The Northern Ireland unemployment rate (6.2%) continues to compare very favourably to the April 2015 rates for the European Union (9.7%) and the Republic of Ireland (9.7%).
Mr Bell added: "Local businesses continue to attract significant investment both locally and internationally, due to the benefits of Northern Ireland as a cost-competitive location, with developed infrastructure and a highly-skilled workforce.
"Invest NI is instrumental in securing significant investment in the economy and I continue to encourage local companies to explore the range of tailored support programmes from Invest NI, in order to expand existing markets and improve competitiveness."
