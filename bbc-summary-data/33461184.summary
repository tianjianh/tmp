Katie Kelly and daughter Kiah-Mae, from Long Buckby, were last seen in Daventry on Tuesday.  Her boyfriend, Karl Boyle, 18, the baby's father is believed to be with them.
Police said they were concerned for their safety and believe they may be in the Northampton area.
Det Ch Insp Elliott Foskett said the mother had no baby formula with her.
"We don't believe that Katie meant to leave that day - she has not taken nappies and not taken baby formula with her.
"It may be that she is safe and well with friends and our concern is to find her safe and well."
Twelve detectives were on the case and there was no evidence to suggest she was in any immediate danger he said.
In a direct appeal Mr Foskett said: "Katie, I know you are probably scared, but I want to reassure you that we just want to make sure both you and Kiah-Mae are safe."
He added: "Before she went missing, Katie did not take any money or belongings with her."
Anyone who may have spotted them is asked to contact police.
Katie is 5ft 7in tall, of slim build with long, dark brown hair and green eyes.
She was wearing black leggings, a white T-shirt and trainers when she went missing and has a diamond-effect bracelet and gold locket, officers said.
She was supposed to get a taxi in Corby on Tuesday but did not get into it, police said.
She was spotted later in the Standens Barn area of Northampton by a friend at 19:30 BST.
