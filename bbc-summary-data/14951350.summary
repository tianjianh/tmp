Carlos Tevez must await chance, says Roberto Mancini

Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini says Carlos Tevez must wait for his chance to get back into the team.

Tevez, who missed a penalty against Wigan last Saturday, was back on the bench for the midweek Champions League game against Napoli.
Mancini insists that Tevez, who failed to secure a summer move away from the club, must accept the situation.
"In this moment there are players that are better than him but Carlos is here training," he said.
"Carlos will have a chance to play. I don't know if he is happy but every player that can't play is not happy. This is normal.
"He will have his moment."
The form of fellow strikers Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero, who have scored six league goals apiece so far this season, mean that the 27-year-old Argentina international's chances have been limited, while Mario Balotelli has also played just one league game.
But Mancini believes his free-scoring side still need to be more ruthless in front of goal than neighbours and arch-rivals Manchester United, who have scored 18 goals - three more than City - in their first four Premier League games.
When City underlined their title credentials with a 5-1 win at Tottenham last month, United bettered them with a 8-2 victory over Arsenal.
Mancini's men impressed again by beating Wigan 3-0 last week, only for United to hammer Bolton 5-0.
The Italian said: "Man United are a top team - they have been used to winning for a long time. They have strong players.
"When they played against Arsenal, when they scored two or three goals, they continued trying to score.
"We need to have this mentality. If we have a game like Tottenham where we can score, we need to continue to try to play."
