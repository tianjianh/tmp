A woman whose home was targeted in a petrol bomb attack in Larne, County Antrim, has said she thought she and her son were going to be burnt to death.

It happened at about 08:00 BST on Friday in Walnut Park. The device broke the window, ending up in the living room of the property.
Police believe it may be linked to recent attacks in the area.
The woman appealed for such attacks in the Larne area to stop.
She was about to get out of bed at 08:00 BST on Friday when she heard a crash.
"I thought it was something that had fallen in the house," she said.
"I heard another smash and my son realised it was the windows going in.
"I was coming out of the bedroom and he shouted up, mum, get up, get up, and the smoke met me at the top of the stairs.
"I didn't know whether to run through the smoke, get back in the room, wait for the fire brigade and I just decided I'm getting out through this smoke even if I do get burnt, I just have to get out of this house."
The woman said she suffered from panic attacks and what had happened had "made them a million times worse".
She added that she had no idea why her home was subjected to such an attack.
"It's ridiculous, half of Larne is getting targeted and it's just not fair," she said.
"This is just devastating I don't know how I'm ever going to sleep again. Why would you want to do that to another human being, whoever is doing this is sick and it needs to stop."
Det Chief Insp Dunny McCubbin said: "Our enquiries into this incident are at an early stage but a strong line of enquiry is that it is linked to a number of recent incidents in the Larne area."
Police have appealed for witnesses.
