[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A thief who stole a man's car from Glasgow's west end was caught because the car had a tracker device.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Devine, 27, demanded James Watson, 32, get out of his Vauxhall Astra and then drove off with it on 2 December last year.
The tracker led police to a filling station in Bishopbriggs, where Devine was filling the car with petrol.
He pled guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court and was jailed for 10 months and 15 days.
Devine, from North Kelvinside, was also disqualified from driving for nine months.
When he spotted police at the filling station, he ran off but was caught by officers and claimed: "I didn't steal it, I was borrowing it."
The court heard Mr Watson was a manager at an Arnold Clarke dealership.
He had just parked on Hopehill Road to start work when Devine approached him.
Procurator fiscal depute John Bedford said: "Devine then opened the driver's door and stated to Mr Watson to get out the vehicle."
He said Devine started the engine with the keys that were left in the ignition then drove off
Mr Bedford added: "It was established that Mr Watson's vehicle was fitted with a tracking system."
It was activated and it was used to track the movements of the vehicle.
