The incident, involving two Volkswagen Golf cars, happened near Storey Arms at about 22:15 GMT on Friday.
Five teenage male drivers from vehicles believed to have been travelling in convoy at the time have been arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
One motorist who arrived on the scene shortly after the crash described seeing a car engine lying in the road.
Dyfed-Powys Police said two males, from Barry, in Vale of Glamorgan had died, along with two female passengers. Three others are being treated for serious injuries in hospital.
Dylan Jones, head teacher at Ysgol Bro Morgannwg in Barry, confirmed one of those killed was a sixth form pupil at the school.
A former male pupil had also died, he said, while a third pupil was seriously injured in hospital.
"We had a junior eisteddfod this morning and some of the sixth form were stewarding the event when news started to come in," he said.
"I have spoken to both parents and we are preparing for Monday so that we can offer all assistance and counselling to the pupils."
A statement on the school's website reads: "Following a car accident we received some sad news about our pupils.
"Our thoughts and sympathies are with their families and we wish a speedy recovery to all those who have also been injured in the incident."
Supt Chris Curtis, from Dyfed-Powys Police, said the force was investigating what happened.
"This is a tragic incident and our thoughts are with the families at this difficult time," he said.
"We are working with South Wales Police in order to provide support to the families affected and also the communities they live within."
Witness Nigel Shiel from Brecon explained how another motorist moved his vehicle closer to the crash scene so his headlights were able to give emergency crews more light to work.
"You could tell by the wreckage itself that it was a very large impact," he said.
"We are used to incidents on the Beacons because of the shape of the roads but it wasn't until you got close to it that you could see how serious it was.
"I got out of my car and approached some of the youths walking around. They seemed a bit shocked which is understandable," he said.
A green Volkswagen Golf and a black Volkswagen Golf estate were involved in the collision.
