Leigh Griffiths: Striker says treble triumph shows Celtic can handle the pressure

Leigh Griffiths insists Celtic proved their mettle by completing a domestic treble of trophies.

Saturday's Scottish Cup final win over Aberdeen meant Celtic became the first Scottish side to go an entire season without losing a domestic fixture.
Striker Griffiths, who scored 18 goals this term, says Brendan Rodgers' men proved their strength of character.
"We can handle pressure - if you can't handle pressure at Celtic, there's no point in being here," Griffiths said.
"There's been pressure ever since we started the season and we proved how well we can cope with it.
"I've been dreaming of this all season. This group of players are a joy to work with every day, and this is a fitting tribute to the way we've played all season."
The Scotland forward, 26, dedicated Celtic's "invincible" season to the club's supporters, who revelled in the glory of their most successful year since 2001 - the last time the Premiership champions completed a treble.
"I can imagine a few boys will be out for days - and I'm one of them," Griffiths told BBC Scotland.
"We do it for the fans. They come in their numbers every single week, home and away, they don't stop backing us, and we just wanted to give something back."
An injury-time winner from substitute Tom Rogic earned Celtic a 2-1 victory in Saturday's Hampden showpiece, as Rodgers' side overcame an effective Aberdeen team.
The final may prove to be winger Patrick Roberts' last game for Celtic, as his 18-month loan deal from Manchester City comes to an end.
The 20-year-old opted to remain with the Parkhead club rather than join England's squad for the Under-20 World Cup, but indicated he is unsure where he will play next season.
"I don't know - I'm just enjoying it for now," Roberts said when asked about his future. "It's a great bunch of lads, and a great day for us. Glasgow is green and white.
"It was very dramatic. We've known all through the year they've put in some good games against us, but we stuck to our normal game, we kept penetrating them to the end, and Tom was tremendous - what a goal.
"It's been a great season for me personally and to win the treble and go invincible is unbelievable."
Midfielder Stuart Armstrong, whose goal cancelled out Jonny Hayes' first-half opener, has been one of the stars of Celtic's stellar season.
The former Dundee United player, 25, has thrived under Rodgers' tutelage, contributing 16 goals and earning his Scotland debut in the 2018 World Cup qualifying win over Slovenia in March.
"We always believed and in the second half we grew in confidence," Armstrong said. "We created chance after chance and I thought as the game went on we were going to get one clear-cut.
"Tom's done magnificently for the goal and I thought we got what we deserved at the end.
"When you get chances and don't take them in big games, maybe it's not going to be your day, but we kept going and we've managed to do it."
