Interim coach Stuart Lancaster is expected to name Scarlets number eight Morgan and Saracens midfielder Farrell in his elite squad on Wednesday.
Asked if Morgan should be in the XV, Dallaglio told BBC Sport: "No, you need some experience in the squad first.
"The lad needs to experience the culture and the environment."
Leadership is really, really important. The more leaders we can get in the squad the better, the likes of Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley, Tom Wood
Bristol-born Morgan, 22, has opted to play for his native country rather than Wales, where he has just qualified on the three-year residency rule.
Farrell, 20, has already been mooted as the long-term answer for England at number 10, even though he has spent most of the season playing at centre outside Charlie Hodgson for Saracens.
"Owen Farrell is playing well and England have got some interesting selections at 10," former England captain Dallaglio commented.
"Jonny Wilkinson has retired, Toby Flood looks like he might be injured. Do you think putting Owen Farrell in against Scotland away [in their opening match on 4 February] is a fair baptism? I think Stuart Lancaster might look to the likes of Charlie Hodgson.
"I'd certainly have Farrell in the squad, he is definitely an England number 10 or 12 of the future. I remember Jonny Wilkinson coming into the England team and he made his debut on the wing at home, he didn't make his debut at 10 away from home."
Saracens' 20-year-old Owen Farrell is the talk of the town and sure to be included; he might start at centre if England want a 'second five-eighth' in midfield. Does Lancaster now give Farrell his head at 10? Or turn to his Saracens team-mate Charlie Hodgson, whose distribution skills are still top notch even if his Test career stalled because of defensive concerns.
Who should be in England's elite squad?
Asked who should captain the team in the Six Nations, Dallaglio said: "Leadership is really, really important. The more leaders we can get in the squad the better, the likes of Chris Robshaw, Dylan Hartley, Tom Wood.
"I'm not going to put my neck on the line, it comes down to having a number of different leaders. At the moment it looks like Robshaw and Wood might fit the bill, it's heavily intimated the captaincy is likely to come from one of those two."
Dallaglio, speaking in his role as an ambassador for the 2015 World Cup, added: "England have got a wonderful challenge on their hands.
"We were clearly very disappointed both on the field and off the field throughout the World Cup [in New Zealand in 2011] and it's a chance for us to really turn things around, get the confidence back in the public and people believing in the England team.
4 February v Scotland (away)
11 February v Italy (away)
25 February v Wales (home)
11 March v France (away)
17 March v Ireland (home)
"It won't happen overnight but England have got a great chance to build. We'd like to be a lot further ahead in terms of development but perceptions can change very quickly. Careers can be born and made.
"Of course England can win the World Cup, they've got a great chance but we've got to take it one step at a time and reconnect with the fans. In order to win the next World Cup we've got to find some new stars, some Jonny Wilkinsons of 2015 who are really going to take England forward."
