Flintshire snow fall man's hospital visits before death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pensioner who fell and hit his head while clearing snow died after several visits to hospital, a pre-inquest hearing in Ruthin heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Retired carpenter Lawrence Birch, 78, from Cymau, Flintshire, died at Wrexham's Maelor Hospital in June 2013.
He first went to A&E following the fall on 29 March and returned a couple of times until his death.
Coroner John Gittins said Mr Birch's family had concerns about the treatment he received on the different occasions.
Barrister Angela Barnes said one of the family's concerns was over an apparent lack of transparency in Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's handling of the case.
A full inquest will be held at a later date.
