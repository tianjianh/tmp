James Wilson gave the Seagulls the lead with a low first-half effort into the far corner from Sam Baldock's assist.
Brighton failed to add to Wilson's strike after the break and were thankful Ola John missed a chance from close range for a Reading equaliser.
Chris Hughton's side climb to second above Middlesbrough after Hull drew against Nottingham Forest.
Victory stretched Brighton's unbeaten home run to six Championship matches and saw them return to the top two for the first time since 14 December.
They sit a point above third-placed Middlesbrough, who have played a game fewer and host fourth-placed Hull on Friday.
Wilson's left-footed finish came from Baldock's surging run at the Reading defence before a well-placed through ball on the edge of the penalty box.
Reading had to wait for their chances to arrive, with Michael Hector missing one of their better ones when he blazed a rebound over the bar following Matej Vydra's shot.
Midfielder John also failed to direct a shot on target from six yards out as he was distracted by an onrushing David Stockdale.
Reading stay 15th, eight points above the relegation zone.

Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: "It's a good win, I think we were worthy winners. We were a little bit edgy second half, I think that's understandable, but first half we were very good.
"We were worthy of our lead and I think we restricted their chances. They've got good quality, we knew it was going to be a tough game and it was.
"Sam Baldock was full of running and we wanted to be able to stretch them a bit more. I thought we did that and countered really well.
"I thought he was part of a good team performance and certainly gave us a lot of running today."

Reading manager Brian McDermott: "I have talked to the players and we spoke about how Reading has been a great club over a period of time.
"We have been successful and we need to find that Reading identity, and always make sure games against Reading are hard, tough matches.
"But now we have talked, it is time to start doing. The players have to respond positively in the final 10 games of the season."
