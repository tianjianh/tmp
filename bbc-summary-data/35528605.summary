The Argentina international sat out December's Fifa Club World Cup semi-final after being diagnosed with renal colic, a type of abdominal pain commonly attributed to kidney stones.
He was able to play in the final three days later, and has played in all of Barca's league games since.
A club statement said Messi, 28, will return to "normal duties" on Wednesday.
"Barcelona striker Lionel Messi will undergo several tests on Monday and Tuesday to assess the evolution of the kidney problems he suffered last December," it said.
Messi has scored 12 goals in 17 La Liga games this season to help Barcelona go three points clear at the top of the table.
He played the full 90 minutes of Sunday's 2-0 win at bottom club Levante.
On Wednesday, Barca visit Valencia in the second leg of their Copa del Rey semi-final, which they lead 7-0 on aggregate.
