Manuel, 20, became the first black female swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal, while Oleksiak, 16, won Canada's first gold of these Games.
Both women finished in 52.70 seconds, a new Olympic record.
Sweden's Sarah Sjostrom took bronze, with Australian sisters Bronte and Cate Campbell fourth and sixth respectively.
The last time two swimmers won joint golds in the Olympics was in 2000 when Americans Gary Hall and Anthony Ervin shared the men's 50m freestyle title.
Oleksiak, who has also won a silver medal in the 100m butterfly and two relay bronze medals in Rio, becomes the first competitor born after 1 January, 2000 to claim an Olympic gold medal in an individual event.
The Campbell sisters were expected to battle for the gold and at the halfway point world record holder Cate Campbell led with Bronte second.
However, the pair, who helped Australia win the 4x100m freestyle relay on Saturday, faded in the second half of the race to miss out on the medals entirely.
Manuel said: "My first gold medal, at my first Olympics, is kind of a surprise to me.
"I never thought I would be in this position but I'm so blessed and honoured to be on the medal stand. All my hard work has paid off and I am really happy about it.
"I will just remember all the memories I made. Team USA is awesome. We're a family and it's a great support system. Regardless of our achievements, we're all there for each other and we are friends."
Oleksiak said: "This is amazing, to tie for a gold. I never thought I'd win a gold. It means so much. She (Manuel) deserves it as much as me."
Rebecca Adlington, double Olympic gold-medal winning swimmer, on BBC One: "I'm so shocked by that race. I don't think it's sunk in.
"Cate Campbell broke the world record two months ago - how can you go from that to sixth? It just baffles me."
