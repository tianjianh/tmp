The event saw about 5,000 people gather on and around Magdalen Bridge to celebrate the traditional spring festival.
The bridge was open to pedestrians but closed to traffic from 03:00 BST.
In past years revellers have been injured jumping into the river. The city council, police and ambulance called for "responsible" celebrations.
Peter McQuitty, of Oxford City Council, said: "May Morning is a popular traditional celebration and over the last few years we've provided a safe environment in which people can enjoy this event.
"It is always dangerous to enter the river, regardless of the water levels, and you are often unaware of the currents, the river levels or what lies on the river bed."
Each year Hymnus Eucharisticus is sung by 16 college choristers from the top of Magdalen College tower.
The hymn was composed in the 17th Century by a fellow of Magdalen and has been sung every year as the sun rises on the first morning of May.
Bells then ring out over the city for about 20 minutes.
Mark Blandford-Baker, home bursar of Magdalen College, said: "I was struck this morning by just how beautiful and timeless this event is - there's a lot of detailed planning that goes into it - it has to go just right."
Roads in the city centre were closed for the celebrations until about 09:00 BST.
