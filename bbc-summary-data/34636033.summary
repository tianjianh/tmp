Karel Fraeye: Charlton Athletic appoint interim head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Charlton Athletic have appointed Karel Fraeye as interim head coach following Guy Luzon's sacking at the weekend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 37-year-old Belgian assisted Jose Riga at the end of the 2013-14 season when he helped the Addicks avoid relegation from the Championship.
Fellow Belgian Wim De Corte will assist him on a temporary basis after Luzon's backroom team also left the Valley.
Charlton are in the relegation zone in the Championship and without a league victory since 22 August.
Luzon was sacked on Saturday after a 3-0 home defeat by Brentford left Charlton 22nd in the second tier having lost seven of their last nine league games.
The 40-year-old had won just 12 of his 36 matches in charge since taking over in January.
