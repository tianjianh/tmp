The festival in Ullapool will mark its 13th year when it takes on a different format on 29 and 30 September.
For the first time it will be held on the town's pier after the organisers were unable to secure the continued use of the site's usual venue.
Acts include The View, Glasvegas, The Pigeon Detectives, Hunter and the Bear, The Rezillos and the Vatersay Boys.
The Wonder Stuff, Twin Atlantic and Mark Radcliffe's band Galleon Blast have previously played at Loopallu - which is Ullapool backwards.
A spokesman for the festival said: "The whole team would like to say a big thank you to all who have come over the years, your support and enthusiasm made the event what it was and what it is.
"Loopallu may come back in the future in a different guise, but for now let's have a party one last time."
He added: "Loopallu is dead. Long live Loopallu."
