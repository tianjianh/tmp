Mills and Clark improved on the silver they won in London by taking Olympic gold in the women's 470 event in Rio.
Four-time world champion Giles Scott, who won Finn gold at Rio 2016, was nominated for the men's award but it went to Argentina's Santiago Lange.
"I've got the gold medal that was the childhood dream and the goal we set," said Clark, 37, who retired after Rio.

Mills, 28, added: "Our whole six years together has been focused on building our team, making it as strong as it can be.
"London was a rushed Olympics where we had 18 months and it was kind of hashed together. Rio we had four years to really get it right and our team is at the centre of this. To finish like this just means everything."
