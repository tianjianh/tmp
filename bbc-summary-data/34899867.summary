Two-time world champion Becky James is set to represent Great Britain for the first time in almost two years at next week's Track World Cup in New Zealand.

The 23-year-old made her track comeback in August after 18 months out because of a knee injury and cancer scare.
James, who last rode for Britain at the 2014 World Championships, is joined by Jason Kenny and Philip Hindes in the squad in Cambridge.
The event, from 4-6 December, offers qualification points for Rio 2016.
James, from Wales, won the sprint and keirin titles at the 2013 World Championships in Belarus.
In May 2014, she had an operation to remove abnormal cells following a cervical screening, which could have developed into cancer if left untreated. She was also suffering from knee and shoulder injuries.
She has since revealed she has a new outlook on life and sport, saying "At the time I thought, 'It doesn't matter about being injured, the main thing is I have to get my health right'."
Technical director Shane Sutton said: "It's great to see Becky James come back into the fold."
Sir Bradley Wiggins and the first-choice women's endurance squad, led by Laura Trott, have been rested, but Ed Clancy is available following a back problem.
Sutton added: "We're in the fortunate position that our performance across men's and women's endurance has left us in a strong position in qualification, allowing us to blood some of our younger academy riders."
Next week's World Cup is the second of three in the 2015-16 season, following October's meeting in Colombia and before January's finale in Hong Kong.
GB team: Becky James, Jess Varnish, Katy Marchant, Jason Kenny, Philip Hindes, Callum Skinner, Lewis Oliva, Ed Clancy, Chris Latham, Germain Burton, Mark Stewart, Oliver Wood, Emily Nelson, Emily Kay, Manon Lloyd, Megan Barker, Abigail Dentus.
