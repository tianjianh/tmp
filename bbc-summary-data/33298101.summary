[SN]TITLE[SN]
City Deal expansion to Aberdeen proposed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour leadership candidate Ken Macintosh has proposed that the City Deal programme should be extended to Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The programme is a partnership between central and local government in targeted regions of the UK.
Mr Macintosh said his proposal would bring "billions of pounds" and tens of thousands of jobs to the north east.
The Scottish leadership contest pitches Mr Macintosh against his fellow-MSP Kezia Dugdale.
The result will be announced on 15 August.
Speaking in Aberdeen, Mr Macintosh said: "For too long this city and this region have been short changed by the Scottish Government.
"A disproportionate amount of attention has been paid to other areas of Scotland at the expense of Aberdeen and the North-east and I intend to put that right."
