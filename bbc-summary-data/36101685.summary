Sex crimes rose from 4,108 to 5,016 while violent crime went up from 40,771 to 49,046.
Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday show there were just over 185,000 recorded crimes in Wales in 2015, a rise of 2.5% compared to last year.
The total number of crimes went from 180,648 in 2014 to 185,075 in 2015.
Across Wales and England the number of sexual offences recorded by police rose to more than 100,000 for the first time ever.
The ONS said improvements in crime recording processes by the police were thought to be the main driver of the change.
