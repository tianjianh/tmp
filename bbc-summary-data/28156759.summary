The road was closed overnight between junction eight for Bishop's Stortford and junction seven for Harlow for a "complex" clean-up following the accident at 17:10 BST.
The lorry was recovered and the northbound side opened at 06:00 BST.
Essex Fire Service said the chemicals were not hazardous.
No other vehicles were involved in the crash.
The chemicals were identified as melamine formaldehyde resin and phosphoric acid.
An Environment Agency spokesman said: "We were there in an advisory capacity. Chemicals were contained on site and drains blocked to ensure the material could not run off site.
"Chemicals were tankered away to be disposed of correctly.  There is no evidence or reports of any environmental impact."
Essex Police said the lorry driver received cuts and bruises but was not believed to be seriously injured and was due to be interviewed later.
