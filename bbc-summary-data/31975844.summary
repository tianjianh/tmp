It follows the publication of the latest Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland report.
It found there had been improvements by justice organisations in carrying out earlier recommendations over the care and treatment of victims and witnesses.
However, the review also said that delay remains a major concern for many victims and witnesses.
The CJI report looked at progress in implementing recommendations from its separate reviews of the care and treatment of victims and witnesses and the use of special measures published in 2011 and 2012.
Of 28 recommendations made across the two inspections, 27 were said to have been achieved either in full or in part.
The chief inspector of criminal justice in Northern Ireland, Brendan McGuigan, said: "While there has been very good progress, and inspectors welcome that, there is no room for complacency.  I would urge a continuing effort to close the gap between standards and delivery.
"The commitment of various leaders across the criminal justice system and the clear political support, together with the personal interest of the minister of justice have been central to the good progress made to date."
PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Chris Noble said: "We welcome this report, which reflects the commitment of the PSNI to work with the PPS, Victim Support and other key partners to develop a criminal justice system which is accessible and supportive and provides effective and supportive outcomes to victims and witnesses.
"The commitment of the police service to delivering better services to victims can be seen in our work with the PPS to deliver a joint victim and witness care unit, which provides a professional and more personal service to all victims and witnesses throughout their time in the justice system."
