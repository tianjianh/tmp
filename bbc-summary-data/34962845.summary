And now the Commons Health Select Committee says a similar policy in England would help to cut sugar consumption at least in the short term.

On social media, there has been overwhelming criticism of the idea. And this is reflected in emails received by the BBC.
Helen Attwood said: "I have had type-1 diabetes for 36 years.

"I have to buy sugar regularly, and sugary drinks in particular are great at treating hypo[glycemia]s - one of the issues associated with this disease.
"It doesn't seem fair that I have to pay more to treat a medical condition which I ended up with through no fault of my own. "
But there was also some cautious support for the proposed sugar tax.
One anonymous emailer to the BBC said: "I agree something must be done.
"The school attended by my grandchildren has machines selling cans of fizzy drinks, crisps et cetera.
"It would be a good start if that stopped.
"The answer is not just banning things, it is educating young people.
"The more you ban them, the more they will want them."
