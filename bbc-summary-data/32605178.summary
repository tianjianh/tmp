Election 2015: Miliband - Voters will get it right

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Voters have a choice between a prime minister who will put working people first - and one who favours the rich and powerful, Ed Miliband has said.

But the Labour leader says he believes the public will "make the right judgement" at the ballot box on 7 May.
With less than 24 hours to go before polls open, he insisted he would go "right down to the wire" to persuade wavering voters to back Labour.
His party won 258 seats at the 2010 election. It needs 326 to win outright.
Blair support
However, polls suggest no party will win a majority in the House of Commons following Thursday's nationwide poll.
With less than 24 hours to go, former Labour prime minister Tony Blair joined the final appeal to voters by tweeting a photo of himself holding a placard saying: "Vote Labour".
And Mr Miliband, campaigning in north-west England and Yorkshire, warned that a fresh coalition government of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats posed a "huge risk" to working families.
'Right down to the wire'
He also insisted that only Labour could "rescue our National Health Service, which needs rescuing, from David Cameron".
"Many people are making up their minds in this election and my message to all those undecided voters is you can have another five years of a prime minster who will put the rich and powerful first in our country - or if I'm prime minster I'll put working people first," he told the BBC.
He sidestepped questions about potential deals that Labour might make in the event of a hung parliament to stress that he was going "right down to the wire" to talk about issues that matter to British people, such as the NHS and family finances.
Asked if he really believed he was going to be prime minister, he said: "I'm optimistic but it will be in the hands of the people come tomorrow and I know the people will make the right judgment.
"And I hope people make a judgement on the basis of what's best for them and their family because I'm not just asking people to vote Labour, I'm asking people to vote to put their family first in this election.
"I think on the ballot paper is the National Health Service, tax credits and child benefits, family finances, our young people and that's why I ask people to vote Labour."
NHS survival
Mr Miliband made his appeal as Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman insisted the 7 May poll was a "crucial watershed election for the NHS".
"I don't think it will survive how people want it to survive under the Tories," she said.
She spoke out as the Labour Party revealed that it had engaged in five million conversations with voters since the beginning of the year.
The Labour leader has visited 50 different constituencies during the election campaign, compared with David Cameron, who has visited the most at 68 and Nick Clegg, who has been to 35. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been to 12.
