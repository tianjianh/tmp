Timeline: Bristol Rovers' stadium supermarket campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Talks over what to do with Bristol Rovers' home ground have been a long running saga. The club first mooted plans to expand the Memorial Ground in 2005. Those were later ditched in favour of a 21,000 seater stadium on the outskirts of the city. Here is how the story developed.

20 March: Justice Hickinbottom dismisses the judicial review paving the way for the supermarket - and stadium - to be built.

13 July: The High Court rules in favour of Sainsbury's saying the way the deal was structured was an "insuperable barrier to the club". Chairman Nick Higgs describes it as a "huge disappointment".
