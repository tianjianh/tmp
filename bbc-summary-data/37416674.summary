(Close): UK shares built on Monday's gains but the pound slid as traders waited for the outcome of central bank meetings in Japan and the US.

The benchmark FTSE 100 share index was up 17.24 points at 6,830.79.
On the foreign exchanges, the pound fell back below $1.30 against the dollar, dropping 0.4% to $1.2974.
The US Federal Reserve will announce its decision on interest rates on Wednesday, although the chances of rate rise appear to have diminished.
Against the euro, the pound fell 0.44% to €1.161.
"The pound seems to be a victim of some skittishness ahead the major central bank meetings this week in Japan and the US," said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital.
"Markets anticipate the Fed will keep rates on hold but a hike is not being ruled out, which may be rattling traders."
Shares in the drugs giant GlaxoSmithKline were little changed at £16.45p as it named Emma Walmsley, its current head of consumer healthcare, as its new chief executive.
The biggest gainers among FTSE 100 shares were Burberry, up 48p or 3.6% at £13.79; Shire, up 132p or 2.6% at £53.15; and Johnson Matthey, up 62p or 1.9% at £32.72.
