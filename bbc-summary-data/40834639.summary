[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Winnall's equaliser earned Sheffield Wednesday their first point of the season after a draw with QPR.

QPR forward Jamie Mackie, who only found the net once in 2016-17, scored his first this campaign from a tough angle after being put in behind.
But Owls sub Winnall drilled home in his first match this term from Barry Bannan's cross to pull the hosts level.
Late on, Kazenga LuaLua had a superb chance to give Rangers victory, but he fired wide when one-on-one.
LuaLua, who joined the R's on loan from Brighton on Friday, was teed up by Conor Washington, but could not find the target as Ian Holloway's men continued their unbeaten start to the season.
Things had been looking rosy for QPR when Mackie slotted past Keiren Westwood, and to make matters worse for Wednesday, Glenn Loovens was injured when he fell awkwardly trying to block the shot.
They also lost Sam Hutchinson to injury, but the double departure brought about the introduction of Winnall, who reportedly had a training ground bust-up with team-mate Fernando Forestieri this week, leading to the Italian being left out of the squad for Saturday's match.
Winnall, who only scored three goals last season after his move from Barnsley, fired home when Bannan's cross fell to him, and Gary Hooper almost put the Owls ahead when Josh Scowen cleared his effort off the line.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
"The first half was divided. They scored one goal from their one chance and we had a few chances also.
"The second half was completely different. We started very well and this is our Sheffield Wednesday. We pressed Queens Park Rangers much more and moved the ball better.
"We started to create problems, we achieved the first goal, we nearly achieved the second goal with two clear situations, but after 30 minutes we decreased a little. This was where we needed extra energy from the bench, but we lost that opportunity."
QPR manager Ian Holloway:
"By the end of the game, the little spell they had just after half-time, where we could have wobbled... they caught us with a punch and they could have maybe had another couple, but we came through that and gave a good account of ourselves in the end.
"Did we do enough to win? Possibly not, but that final ball on our breaks we had maybe 10 opportunities to put someone through and only one of them ended up being a clear chance.
"All I know is we're improving, we're learning and there were lots of bits I really liked. Obviously I'll have to take one point instead of the three we wanted."
