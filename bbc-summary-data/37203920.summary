Australia were more competitive than in the 42-8 defeat in Sydney last weekend, but were 15-9 down at half-time with Israel Dagg scoring a brace of tries.
Julian Savea and Sam Cane then added further scores to make it two wins from two in the 2016 Rugby Championship.
In Saturday's other game, Argentina beat South Africa 26-24 after a late Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias penalty.
In a sometimes fractious match, Australia lock Adam Coleman was yellow-carded for a shoulder charge on Ben Smith, while All Blacks prop Owen Franks put his hand into the face of Australia second row Kane Douglas at a maul, drawing accusations of eye gouging.
"We saw it [the Franks incident] at the time," said Australia coach Michael Cheika. "I'm sure the match review will pick that up. It was pretty open, it would be pretty hard for the match review guy to miss."
Australia were heavily criticised after their hammering at home last weekend and New Zealand coach Steve Hansen said that as a result "they were going to come and bring whatever they had to bring".
All Blacks captain Kieran Read said: "There was quite a bit of niggle out there - perhaps we let it get to us a little bit in the first half."
Argentina, who lost to South Africa 30-23 last week, went into half-time with a 13-3 lead in Salta after Joaquin Tuculet's try.
A Bryan Habana try brought the Springboks level only for Argentina to open up a 10-point lead after Juan Manuel Leguizamon crossed and Juan Martin Hernandez kicked the conversion and a penalty
Morne Steyn kicked two penalties either side of a Pieter-Steph du Toit try to put South Africa ahead in the final 10 minutes.
However, Iglesias' kick, with three minutes left, ensured Argentina achieved their second win in 24 meetings with the Springboks.
The All Blacks next face Argentina on 10 September, with the Wallabies hosting South Africa later on the same day.
The Rugby Championship is contested home and away between the four southern hemisphere sides, while the Bledisloe Cup - which is a best-of-three Test series - has been played between New Zealand and Australia since 1932.
The third and final match of the 2016 Bledisloe Cup, which is not part of the Rugby Championship, takes place on 22 October in Auckland.
