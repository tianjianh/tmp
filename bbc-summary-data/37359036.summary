[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
(Noon): Mining firms were the top five winners on the benchmark FTSE 100 index on Wednesday.

Glencore, Fresnillo and Anglo American were all more than 3% higher, helped by rising commodity prices.
Shares in online grocer Ocado were down another 8%, adding to Tuesday's 14% slump after it said intense competition was hitting profit margins.
Shares in building firms were also among the big movers in trading in London on Wednesday.
Galliford Try was the biggest mover on the FTSE 250, with a 6% rise. It reported strong annual results and also proposed raising its dividend payout by 21%.
However, builders were also among the biggest losers on the FTSE 100.
Taylor Wimpey and Berkeley Group were down more than 1%.
One trader said those shares could be backtracking after recent gains.
Another trader said that investors might be switching into Galliford shares due to its higher dividend payout.
Overall the benchmark FTSE 100 index gained ground through the morning, adding 0.7% to 6,712.
Shares in European luxury goods firms were lower after France's Hermes warned of an "increasingly uncertain trading environment" and Switzerland's Richemont announced disappointing results.
That put pressure on Burberry shares which fell 0.7%.
Against the dollar the pound was little changed at $1.3201 and was also flat against the euro at â‚¬1.1756.
