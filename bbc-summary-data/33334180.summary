The 43-year-old sustained serious injuries to her forearms and face at the 300-acre (121 hectare) Shell Island campsite at Llanbedr.
Emergency services were called just before 08:30 BST, and the incident is under investigation.
Crews said it was understood to have involved a portable gas stove.
The accident follows a similar one last week in Denbighshire, in which a 14-year-old boy suffered neck and arm burns while refilling a camping stove with fuel.
He was taken to hospital after the incident at Hendwr, Corwen on 25 June.
Stuart Millington, the senior fire safety manager for North Wales Fire and Rescue Service, said: "I cannot emphasise enough how important it is for campers using gas to correctly follow the manufactures instructions and to make sure that all appliances are assembled correctly.
"Every year we see injuries as a result of camping incidents, some of them extremely serious.
"Four years ago two men tragically lost their lives after a caravan fire in Barmouth which also resulted in a two-year-old girl sustaining very serious burns."
