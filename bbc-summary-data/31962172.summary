The sporting schedule was also announced as part of celebrations marking 100 days until the Games begin.
The event, being held in the summer, will see 24 competing islands or island groups with about 3,000 competitors.
Games director Steve Bailey said: "Beautiful Jersey is an old song but it has a new arrangement to make it sound more like an anthem."
The previous anthem was Gerard Le Feuvre's Island Home, which was voted for in 2008.
Earlier this month Jersey athlete Steve Bouchard called for the island's "drab and miserable" anthem to be replaced by something more upbeat.
The opening ceremony will be held at Howard Davis Park on Saturday 27 June, with the closing ceremony on Friday 3 July at the same venue.
Mr Bailey said the Games were "a big event and we want to see people supporting not only Jersey athletes, but all the visiting athletes".
Phil Austin, from the International Island Games Association, said: "We've got about 400 gamesmakers and the enthusiasm from them is fantastic.
"They know their role and these are the people who will make the difference."
