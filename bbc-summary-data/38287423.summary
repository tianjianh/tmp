The series follows the story of Mildred Hubble, a girl from a world outside of magic who finds herself landing quite literally head first at Miss Cackle's Academy for Witches.
It's based on the books by famous author Jill Murphy.
Watch Ayshah's report from the red carpet premiere, where she meets the stars and gets some early reviews from kids at the screening.
