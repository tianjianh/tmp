[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Heavy rain and surface water flooding have forced a theme park in Lincolnshire to close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Parts of Pleasure Island Family Theme Park in Cleethorpes were inaccessible to the public due to surface water flooding, manager Neil Ireland said.
He added that no major damage had been caused but high winds and rain also meant some of the park's rides would not have been able to run.
The park is expected to reopen to the public on Tuesday.
