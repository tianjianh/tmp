Ant and Dec dedicated their Bafta TV Award to the Queen after winning a prize for their presentation of her 90th birthday celebration event.
But Netflix's lavish royal drama The Crown left empty handed even though it had the most nominations.
Here are seven things we learned from some of the winners backstage:
"I am not going to be the first female Doctor," said Phoebe Waller-Bridge after winning the prize for best female comedy performance.  "Not that I know of."
The Fleabag star had been the bookies' favourite to take over the lead role in Doctor Who after Peter Capaldi bows out.
But speaking after her Bafta win she seemed to settle the rumours once and for all.
The actress, who has a role in the untitled Han Solo Star Wars spin-off, admitted she hadn't even started writing series two of Fleabag.
"I had an idea on a bus and I thought I might be able to open it up again," she said.
"It's galvanizing because you feel like there's something that resonates with people."
Planet Earth II won the public vote for TV's must-see moment award for its snakes vs iguana chase.
Its makers revealed how every 400 minutes of film shot produces just one minute of screen time.
But fans of the natural history show, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, have a long wait before the next one.
For a start, Planet Earth III hasn't even been commissioned. And even if it had it wouldn't be on TV screens until 2022 at the earliest.
"These things take five years to make even if we started today," said Mike Gunton, the show's executive producer.
Sir David wasn't at the ceremony, and the team admitted they hadn't been able to send him a message about the win.
"Sadly, texting is not an option," Gunton added. "He doesn't do texting."
"It was a horrible year," said Charlie Brooker, after he and his team won best comedy for his satirical review series Wipe.
"At one point I said I don't want to do the show because it was so depressing - and then I was reminded we had a contractual obligation and so we had to push on.
"We've done these shows for years. Do you remember when it was about a woman dropping a cat in a bin? That was the worst thing that happened that year."
Brooker added there were no plans for a snap election special due to lack of time.
"This time last year they asked us if we wanted to do an EU referendum Wipe and I said 'that would be boring - who cares about that?'.
"Which goes to show how much I know."
The Night Manager's Tom Hollander, who won best supporting actor, was the only cast member to be recognised at the Baftas.
The six-part thriller, adapted from the 1993 John Le Carre novel, had been the biggest TV winner at the Golden Globes.
So many were surprised when it got just one Bafta nod.
"This show itself has not been underexposed," admitted Hollander, who played the scheming character Corky.
"We all feel we've had our fair share of attention and it's time to exit stage left and stop slapping ourselves on the back.
"But I'm utterly thrilled to get an award on home territory."
EastEnders star Danny Dyer found out in Who Do You Think You Are? that he is a direct descendant from King Edward III.
Speaking after the show was named best feature programme, he said: "There was a bit of a void in my life and I never understood why I was an actor or why I was famous...
"To understand that I've got a bloodline that is extremely famous fills a little hole.  It's still hard to get my head round."
Had any royals been in touch since the programme?
"No, they've been blanking me!" he joked.
"I wouldn't mind meeting any of them, have a bit of dialogue with them - talk about football or something."
Speaking after Saturday Night Takeaway was named best entertainment programme, Ant and Dec confirmed that ITV is "on board" with the idea of a one-off reunion of hit kids' morning show SM:TV Live.
The show, which ran from 1998 to 2003, launched the presenting careers of the Geordie duo, who appeared alongside Cat Deeley.
Ant said: "We've had first discussions about it and it looks like it's going to go ahead."
Expect the show to land in August or Sept 2018 for its 20th anniversary.
Dec said: "We'll get the team back together and have a bit of fun on a Saturday morning at 09:25."
When Sarah Lancashire picked up her best actress Bafta she thanked The Crown's Claire Foy for "the best 10 hours under a duvet I've ever had".
The Happy Valley star explained later that she'd started the first episode at 09:00 on a Sunday and was still watching in bed 10 hours later.
"There were so many brilliant performances in it but Claire's was so subtle," Lancashire said.
Holding up her gold Bafta mask, she added: "I'd like to be able to chop this in half."
The actress also noted how two of her best roles - in Last Tango in Halifax and Happy Valley - had happened in her late 40s.
"I can't complain," she said. "At a time when most actresses are disappearing I seemed to become very visible."
