Eddie Bilbey, from Ripley, Derbyshire, died shortly after the bout in South Normanton on 24 March.
The teenager was a Nottingham Forest supporter and the event will reflect this, with ex-players due to attend.
Organiser Rhyce Hallsworth said the Eddie's family had been "overwhelmed" by the love and support shown following his death.
Eddie was competing in an East Midlands youth welterweight contest. He collapsed and later died in hospital.
Mike Shinfield, the boy's step-grandfather, who owns Somercotes Elite Boxing Academy where Eddie was a member, told the BBC that he was fit and healthy and there were no concerns relating to his health.
A post-mortem examination into how the teenager died has taken place, but the cause of death will not be made public until May.
Mr Hallsworth, who coaches one of Eddie's brothers at football, said: "The [Bilbey] family have been going through a torrid time and it was a case of what can we do to help?
"They are a lovely family and they help a lot of other people so we needed to do something for them.
"Eddie was a fine young man, dedicated to his sport, always happy to chat and a genuine credit to his family."
He said money raised from the event will go towards charity Bloomin Dementia and the Eddie Bilbey Foundation, which has been set up in the teenager's memory.
Nottingham Forest fans started a round of applause for Eddie during the 17th minute of the match against Huddersfield on 8 April.
Mr Hallsworth said Reds fans have been "absolutely fantastic".
The ticketed event is due to be held at Saltbox, in Nottingham, on Sunday, ahead of Forest's match against Ipswich Town.
