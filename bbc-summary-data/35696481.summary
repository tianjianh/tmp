Williams, who can also play at centre, has made three appearances for Bath since joining the club from the England Sevens side in April 2015.
The 26-year-old scored 39 tries in 22 games for the England Sevens after making his debut in 2012.
"It's a great environment to be in and I feel like I'm constantly improving," he told the club website.
"Bath is a fantastic city to live in, and I've really settled in well so I didn't have any hesitation about staying."
