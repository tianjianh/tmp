"It's just the ranking round, so today's not really big happy. Getting the world record is important but tomorrow's matches are more important," said Kim, referring to the men's team title, which is decided on Saturday.
Team GB's Naomi Folkard finished 23rd in the women's ranking round with a total of 639 points, with Korea's Choi Mi-Sun leading the table with 669 points.
The knockout rounds of the individual competition begin on Monday with the final scheduled to start at 00:43 BST on Saturday, 13 August.
