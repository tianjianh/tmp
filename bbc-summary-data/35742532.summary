It was the 23-year-old's third WTA title of her career and is a welcome boost after a poor start to the year.
Australian Open semi-finalist and fellow Briton Johanna Konta, 24, rose one place to 26 after making the last eight in Monterrey.
Britain's Naomi Broady, 26, is up 20 places to 76 after reaching the semi-finals of the Malaysian Open.
