The 23-year-old, from Kilbarchan, finished Sunday's race in 12th place in two hours 12 minutes 17 seconds.
Ethiopia's Sisay Lemma won in 2:06.26, with compatriot Gulume Tollesa first home in the women's event.
Scott Overall, 32, is the only other British athlete to have finished under the Rio qualifying mark of two hours 14 minutes this year.
"I knew it would hurt at one stage but it hurt pretty much all the way through," said Hawkins.
"Obviously it is the first time I have run that distance at that kind of pace.
"The pace-maker was due to go through halfway at 66.20 and went through it in 66.22 so you can't ask for much more than that. He got me to 30k on the right pace and that kind of thing helps.
"I am really chuffed with the time and delighted to get inside the GB qualifying standard.
"I hope it will be enough at some stage to get me picked for Rio but you never know with marathon selection and a few months to go.
"So we can't say at the moment when or if I will do another one."
Hawkins, second at this month's Great Scottish Run, ran in the 10,000m in last year's Commonwealth Games.
Older sibling Derek competed in the marathon, making them the first brothers to represent Scotland since Ian and Peter Stewart competed at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh.
Derek Hawkins is currently sidelined by a foot injury but has aspirations to run in Brazil in 2016.
"I'd love to see Derek get the time as well - just so long as he's not quicker than me," said Callum Hawkins.
"We'd love to both be at the Olympics for GB in the marathon and it would be pretty special as brothers. We'll have to wait and see a bit longer before we know if that can happen."
