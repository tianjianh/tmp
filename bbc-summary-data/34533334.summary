[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A factory worker who had his arm crushed by machinery has won a £125,000 payout from his employer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Faulds was severely injured when his right arm was pulled into machinery at the bottle-top factory in Bridge of Allan in September 2013.
The 58-year-old said United Closures and Plastics blamed him for the accident and demoted him.
The firm was also fined £12,000 after admitting health and safety breaches at Stirling Sheriff Court.
Mr Faulds, from Falkirk, was working on a printing machine when the accident happened.
His arm was dragged into the offset machine and crushed.
The Health and Safety Executive took United Closures and Plastics to court over the incident, where the firm admitted failing to do a sufficient risk assessment of the machine and failing to ensure proper access.
The firm was issued the £12,000 fine at Stirling Sheriff Court last week.
Mr Faulds, who was off work for more than 14 months after the accident, said he was sacked from his role as production engineer for gross misconduct but was offered another job as an operator.
The father-of-four said: "The thing that upsets me is that all the way through this, they have put the blame on me. They said I did an unsafe act and had a flippant attitude to safety.
"My arm was smashed to pieces and I am now 30% disabled in it.
"The money will change my life because I will be able to buy a flat and look to the future.
"But I am now doing a menial job packing boxes when I was working as a skilled engineer before. But who is going to employ me when it's on my record that I was sacked for gross misconduct?
"I have never had an apology but I would just like them to clear my record."
Mr Faulds' lawyer, Tracey McKenzie from Thompsons Solicitors, said: "Robert is a very hard-working man who was following instructions from his employer when he was seriously injured.
"He was used as a scapegoat and sacked before being reinstated in a lower role.
"His employers were then prosecuted and pled guilty to breaches of health and safety law which totally vindicates Robert's version of events.
"He has now been left with a life-changing injury and his future employment prospects have been greatly affected - it is only right that he has been paid this substantial level of compensation."
No-one from United Closures and Plastics was available for comment.
