[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby attacker Steven Davidson has jail term reduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who inflicted "catastrophic" injuries on a six-week-old baby has had his jail term reduced on appeal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Davidson, 23, admitted shaking the baby girl to her severe injury and danger of life at a house in Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, on 3 October 2012.
The child cannot sit upright or communicate and needs constant care.
Davidson was jailed for seven-and-a-half years in March. Judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh have now cut the term by nine months.
The decision follows an earlier ruling by appeal judges to reduce a seven-and-a-half-year sentence imposed on Stephen Sweeney.
The 27-year-old, from Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, was jailed for a shaking attack on a five-week-old baby boy at a holiday village at Dunoon, in Argyll, in September 2013.
