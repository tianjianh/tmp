Norwich City boss Alex Neil says Portugal striker Nelson Oliveira is starting to answer his critics.

The 25-year-old joined in August for a fee reportedly in excess of Â£4m, but initially struggled to make an impact.
But he has scored in each of his last three games, including the winner against Aston Villa on Tuesday.
"Because he hasn't been in the team of late people questioned him and me signing him for the money we did," Neil told BBC Radio Norfolk.
"But I knew what I was getting, but it was always going to take a little bit of time with him."
Oliveira scored in the EFL Cup tie against Leeds in October, and three times in two games for the Under-23 side in the EFL Trophy, but did not make an impact in the Championship until this month.
"Cameron (Jerome) was in great form at the start of the season so he's had to bide his time," added Neil.
"But three in three and in terms of his link-up, his hold-up play and his quality - he's got 20-odd caps for Portugal - he's a very good player.
"It's such a good feeling to have somebody at the top end of the pitch who can score out of nothing and he's capable of doing it and he's done it regularly so far."
Meanwhile, Norwich have appointed former Scunthorpe, Walsall, Luton Town and Cambridge United boss Richard Money as their new academy manager.
The 61-year-old joins the Canaries from US club Atlanta United, where he worked as academy director.
