Police briefly detained the protesters.
The envoy was questioned on Friday after his Indian wife alleged he sexually abused their three-year-old.
Although a case has been registered against him, he has not been arrested or formally charged. The envoy has made no public comment as yet.
Police say they are trying to confirm if the man has diplomatic immunity.
The wife of the envoy has written to the French ambassador in India and the Indian government, to prevent her husband from leaving the country until all legal proceedings are complete.
She has also asked the French Embassy for financial support for herself and her three children, who are French citizens.
The French Consulate-General in Bangalore confirmed that "a complaint had been lodged regarding the rape of a minor girl who is a French national".
"The complaint names the father of the child, who is a consular agent of this Consulate-General. An investigation is under way for which this Consulate-General is extending its full cooperation with the police and the authorities in charge," the Consulate said in a press release on Monday.
"It remains also in touch with the family of the child," it added.
The complaint was lodged on Thursday night, after the envoy's wife approached the Bangalore-based non-governmental organisation, Enfold India, for help.
