Youngsters at Davyhulme Primary School in Manchester made the film, as the team prepares to face Russia in their opening game on Saturday.
The England team thanked the children via a message on their official Twitter account.
"Everyone in the England camp, including Roy Hodgson, all of the players and coaching staff really appreciates your support," the message read.
Class teacher Lee Parkinson said: "I'm sure you agree it certainly gets you motivated for the Euros."
