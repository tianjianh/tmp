Neil Broom: Derbyshire batsman set to leave after New Zealand recall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Batsman Neil Broom looks set to leave Derbyshire a year before his deal ends after being recalled by New Zealand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Broom, 32, signed a two-year contract in 2015, but has asked to be released so he can join the Black Caps squad for the three-match one-day series against Bangladesh which starts on 26 December.
He joined Derbyshire on a domestic contract but would count as an overseas player after his international recall.
Broom said playing international cricket was "the ultimate".
He told the New Zealand Cricket website:  "I appreciate everything Derbyshire have done for me and have really enjoyed my time with the club.
"At the end of the day I couldn't pass up the opportunity to represent New Zealand and am excited about the opportunity to play international cricket again."
A Derbyshire club statement only confirmed that Broom had asked to leave.
The statement added: "Neil Broom, whose current deal with the club runs until the end of the 2017 season, has made the request to allow him to return to international cricket with New Zealand.
"Derbyshire is currently in communication with Broom and Cricket New Zealand and will make a further statement in due course."
Derbyshire already have Sri Lanka's Jeevan Mendis and Imran Tahir of South Africa sharing their overseas player's role next season, but are allowed a second overseas for the T20 Blast.
Christchurch-born Broom's last international appearance came in a T20 game against Sri Lanka in November 2013.
