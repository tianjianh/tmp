Nowell, 23, returns to the Chiefs squad this weekend against Sale after helping England retain the Six Nations title.
Asked how high Exeter could finish, he said: "I think top two - we obviously want to try and push for the top one.
"It'll only be our fault if we do let it slip now, because it isn't as if we have to chase anyone - we're up there."
Exeter, beaten Premiership finalists last season, are currently second in the table, five points behind leaders Wasps with five games remaining.
"We've worked so hard at the start of the season to get ourselves those points and get ourselves that high," Nowell told BBC Radio Devon. "We need to stay up there and we just need to carry on picking up points where we can."
Chiefs assistant coach Ali Hepher, who says the club have done "most of their business" for next season, believes it does not matter too much if they have to play an away play-off semi-final.
"First and foremost we want to get into those play-offs but our away form has been so good we wouldn't actually worry too much if we were away from home," he said.
"But equally you want to be on your home patch - it gives you a definite advantage."
Cornish-born Nowell, has been spoken about as a possible member of the British and Irish Lions squad for the summer tour of New Zealand, but would not be drawn on his chances.
