Early headers by Rhys Marshall and Ciaran Martyn put the 2014 winners into a 2-0 lead and Eoin Bradley curled in a superb third in the 54th minute.
A Kris Lindsay own goal reduced the deficit and Joel Cooper restored the three-goal gap just before full-time.
Premiership leaders Crusaders are into the last eight thanks to a 3-1 win away to Dungannon Swifts.
The Crues scored through Andrew Mitchell, Michael Carvill and a Dougie Wilson own goal.
Mitchell's opener in the 11th minute was a low 20-yard drive, but the Crues were caught out at the back when Cormac Burke slotted in the equaliser.
Carvill got the decisive touch to restore the Crusaders lead before the break and Wilson's own goal on 59 minutes sealed the away win.
Late in the game, Swifts keeper Coleman saved a Billy Joe Burns penalty after a Jarlath O'Rourke hand ball.
There was a minute's silence at the Oval before Glenavon's game against Glentoran as a mark of respect for striker Mark Farren who died on Wednesday, aged 33.
Farren was best known as Derry City's record goal scorer in the League of Ireland, but he later had a spell with Glenavon.
Marshall's opener for Glenavon came in the 10th minute, just as supporters were beginning to applaud in tribute to Farren whose shirt number was 10.
The Lurgan side ran out easy winners on what as a depressing afternoon for Glentoran.
Loughgall's top scorer Warner Mullen scored both goals as the Championship One side saw off PSNI at Lakeview Park.
Mullen side-footed a 31st-minute opener after the PSNI defence failed to clear.
The Championship player of the month for January then netted a penalty on 58 minutes after visiting keeper Jordan Williamson upended Daniel Ryan.
It was Mullan's 22nd goal of the season.
An Aaron Haire goal late in the game was enough to put Lurgan Celtic through in their home tie against Knockbreda.
Former Portadown player Haire, who also scored in the fifth round win over Bangor, netted past keeper Ryan McBride from six yards in the 79th minute.
Fifteen minutes earlier, McBride had saved a penalty taken by Celtic's Dale Malone.
