Swansea City defender Neil Taylor says the players would work hard for potential new manager Paul Clement.

Managerless Swansea, who are bottom of the Premier League, are set to appoint Bayern Munich assistant boss Clement as their new manager.
The 44-year-old would become the Swans' third manager of the season.
"He's got great credentials as a coach and he comes highly regarded by a few people that have played with him," Taylor told BBC Radio Wales.
"Who will get the job, I don't know. If it is Clement then all the boys will take to him and work as hard as they can and hopefully they can help to turn it around."
Swansea are four points adrift at the bottom of the table at the halfway stage of the season, but Taylor believes the club are not preparing for relegation just yet.
"You can't make an appointment now with a view to being in the Championship next season," he said.
"Whatever team's going out there at the moment is not performing to the best level. That's the honesty of it and it must be horrendous for the fans to watch.
"That's the worst feeling. There aren't 25 bad players in this squad. it's just a severe lack of confidence throughout the team."
The Swans lost 3-0 at home to Bournemouth in their first game since Bob Bradley was sacked, but Taylor says they can turn their fortunes around despite losing their past four games.
He said: "As poorly as we've been playing and the amount of goals we've been conceding, we are still about two wins away from being able to get out of it.
"Once you're out of that bottom three, everything looks completely different. It's the psychological factor of being at the bottom and the manner in which we're losing which is having an effect on everybody at the moment."
