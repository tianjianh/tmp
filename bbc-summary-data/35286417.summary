Premier League predictions: Lawro v Creed stars Jordan & Bellew

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

Lawro's opponent for the latest round of Premier League fixtures are Creed stars Michael B Jordan & Tony Bellew.
Everton fan and professional boxer Bellew plays 'Pretty' Ricky Conlan in the film, that sees Sylvester Stallone reprise his role as the former world heavyweight champion Rocky Balboa.
Balboa is trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson - played by Jordan - the son of his former rival Apollo Creed.

"At one point Ricky was going to be a Liverpool fan," Bellew told BBC Sport. "I said I can't play a Liverpool fan because, if I do that, I cannot go home.
"We got Everton involved instead and I am so happy because the club have given me so much - I have been around Europe watching them and I have supported them since I was a baby - so I feel I have given something back by getting their ground and the club's badge global exposure in this film."
California-born Jordan says listening to Bellew has made him a Toffees supporter too, and explained: "I am an honorary Evertonian now. I cannot speak in a Scouse accent but I can understand it."
You can hear more from Jordan and Bellew on Football Focus at 12:10 GMT on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.
Our scoring system has changed this season and a correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is now worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
From the midweek Premier League games, Lawro got four correct results from 10 matches, with no perfect scores.
His score of 40 points saw him beat comedian and actor Elis James, who picked one correct result, and a state-of-the-art sports-forecasting super-computer called SAM (Sports Analytics Machine), that picked three correct results.
