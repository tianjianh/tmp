[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new run has been launched in Liverpool in memory of 96 football fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster.

Organiser Dom Williams wanted to set up a "legacy event" and hopes the 5K, which takes place on 19 April, will become an annual community fundraiser.
Supporters lost their lives in a crush at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup semi-final in 1989.
Hillsborough Family Support Group Chairwoman Margaret Aspinall said it was a "wonderful way" to remember them.
Mr Williams said he was "extremely moved" by the mosaic tribute at Anfield and "wanted to do something to help".
The 96 5K, which has been organised with BTR Liverpool, starts and finishes at Stanley Park.
Money raised will be donated to Liverpool FC Foundation and Everton in the Community.
Mr Williams has also organised a Hillsborough-Anfield run since 2011.
