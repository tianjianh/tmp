Jess Fishlock column: It's football, football, football in sleepless Seattle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Here in Seattle we are getting ready for our season to begin, but everyone is following the Euros.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
When Wales played England it was at 6am and the pub we were in was chockablock. It was full of England and Wales fans. It was like being at home.
We have the Copa America going on in the US, too. Everybody watched USA played Argentina in a semi-final on Tuesday.
Right now, over here where I am in the west, it's just football, football, football and it's brilliant.
If it's not the Euros its the Copa America and it's a lot of fun. You go to training, watch football, watch more football, do more training.
We had an away game but we got home at around 11am and I went straight home and watched Wales beat Russia.
I watched it at home because we had been travelling from New York on the other side of America so we had to fly five and a half hours.
I was wondering whether to go to the George and Dragon pub, but by the time I got home I was so exhausted I just needed to sit on my sofa.

It was phenomenal. It was interesting to me because I thought that their whole counter-attack would have been quite similar to how they would have liked to have played in the defeat by England.
I just don't think they were quite able to get that moving against England but I think what you were able to see against Russia is just how deadly they are when they can win the ball and breach with the likes of Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale.
With Joe Allen and Joe Ledley, we can break the play and feed it. I thought it was such a good performance from all aspects.
I think the performance against Russia, not just the win, was such a huge confidence boost. It will make teams a lot more wary now of the threat that Wales have.
They have to play with no fear. I know that's easier said than done because they won't want to lose and won't want to concede.

The most important thing was that you know you're going to get a better draw if you win your group.
That was always on Wales' mind. I think if you look at the side of the draw they've been on compared to the side England are on, you know you've done a good job when you see the differences.
As much as I would love to have a time and a place to watch the Euros in the meantime, my next outing will definitely be the Wales game [against Northern Ireland on Saturday] for sure.
I haven't given my future in international football much thought since I've been back in America. I got back after the match against Norway and we played a game two days later.
We travelled last week. Right now, I'm focusing on Seattle. When I head back I will have a chat with [Wales manager] Jayne [Ludlow] and we can have a conversation and see where we think the future lies for me.
