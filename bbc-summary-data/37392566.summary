[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 2-1 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Pope claimed a late winner to give in-form Bury a 2-1 home victory against Chesterfield in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zeli Ismail volleyed the hosts into a 41st-minute lead, only for Kristian Dennis to equalise three minutes later.
But, after an even second half, Pope headed home three minutes from time to secure a fifth straight win for the Shakers and put them second in the table.
The hosts made a positive start with Chesterfield debutant Liam Graham blocking an Ismail shot before the Bury winger fired wide from a Jacob Mellis through-ball.
Dennis then failed to connect with a Jay O'Shea cross, while Ismail was denied by goalkeeper Ryan Fulton.
The game finally calmed down before Conor Wilkinson's free-kick struck a Bury post, and moments later Ismail volleyed home.
Dennis soon bundled in an equaliser from Wilkinson's pass and, after the break, O'Shea's 20-yard shot deflected on to the roof of the Bury net.
The Shakers were not to be denied victory and claimed all three points when substitute Tom Walker delivered a diagonal ball from the left and Pope got in front of his man to steer in his fifth goal of the season.
