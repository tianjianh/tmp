Milton Keynes Dons goalkeeper David Martin has fractured his hand in a training ground incident.

The club have yet to learn of the extent of the injury, but Martin is due to see a specialist for assessment.
The 30-year-old, who has made 38 league appearances for the Dons this season, is set to be replaced by reserve goalkeeper Cody Cropper.
Meanwhile, Karl Robinson says his relegation-threatened team are putting maximum effort into every match.
The Dons are 22nd in the Championship - the final relegation spot - one place below Fulham, who they host on Saturday.
"If people think we can raise our game for Fulham, then we've let people down," 35-year-old Robinson told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"When you put as much detail in as my players do it's physically impossible we could put any more into the games."
Robinson's side have scored the fewest goals in the Championship with 32 in 38 games and only won once in their last seven matches.
"I don't want the season to be over if I'm honest," added Robinson. "I'm really excited and enjoying it, but we're going to have to find something special on Saturday.
"I don't ever put less than 100% into any game. It is what drives me to anxiety and stress. I can't put 101% effort into football."
And, although the Dons face a Fulham side winless in their last six league games, Robinson refused to underestimate the scale of the challenge ahead.
"Their two strikers are probably double my whole squad financially," he added. "When you see the players they could choose on Saturday, it's frightening.
"It shouldn't really be a contest - we'll make it one though."
