[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United came from behind to earn a point at title rivals Hibernian.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Keatings supplied an emphatic finish to a well-worked move to give Hibs the lead, having earlier struck a post with a free-kick.
United hit back midway through the second period, French defender William Edjenguele heading home from a Scott Fraser corner.
Keatings forced a good save from Cammy Bell as Hibs applied late pressure but they could not find a winner.
The result moves Hibs to within a point of Championship leaders Queen of the South, although Neil Lennon's men have now gone three matches without a win.
United remain in fifth, six points off the top.
With an attendance in excess of 15,000 inside Easter Road there was an anticipation that this would be an open, attacking and passionate encounter.
Hibernian dominated the opening quarter, with Keatings rattling the junction of post and crossbar with a free-kick after three minutes.
The striker, making his first start in four league matches, then ran on to a smart pass from Andrew Shinnie to steer a first-time strike into the opposite corner.
At that point few within the stadium would have put money on anything other than a home win. However, Hibs are developing a bad habit of not finishing teams off when in the ascendancy.
United's bad luck in losing Lewis Toshney to a terrible ankle injury early in the second half would go on to work in their favour.
Visiting manager Ray McKinnon was forced into making a number of personnel and tactical switches and the introduction of Charlie Telfer, Cammy Smith and Tope Obedeyi turned the game.
Obadeyi won a corner moments after coming on and from the set-piece Edjenguele barely had to jump to power above his opponents to nod the ball beyond Ofir Marciano.
The momentum changed. United could smell a win but neither side could find a killer final pass in a scruffy encounter littered with mistakes.
Three times this season Hibernian have led at home and failed to win.
Against Queen of the South in the League Cup they lost three goals in the last 24 minutes. Against Ayr United they were 1-0 up midway through the second half but ended up the losing side after Marvin Bartley's red card.
This is nothing new at Easter Road. If Lennon's side are to go on and clinch the title this is a trait they will have to lose, with the likes of United, Falkirk and Queen of the South capable of pushing them all the way.
Hibernian manager Neil Lennon: "It's been the story of the last few games. We were in total control and then, all of a sudden, we get really slack under no pressure.
"We had opportunities to go 2-0 up and that would have killed the game as we were so far in the ascendancy.
"But we let teams back in and it's our own fault. It is also a source of frustration we conceded from a set-play. With the height we have in the team we should be doing a lot better.
"We want to get out of this division and the players have to deal with the expectation better than they are showing at the minute."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "We came here with a lot of injuries and no recognised midfielders. We had to chop and change our system so I was pleased to get a draw.
"We had lots of players in positions they are not accustomed to. It was hard to get a team balance.
"In the first half we wasted a lot of counter-attacks. We could have done a lot better but we were great in the second half. We merited the draw, definitely."
"He [Toshney] is away for an X-ray because his ankle is up. I am devastated for him. I thought he was outstanding. He now has a really bad injury."
