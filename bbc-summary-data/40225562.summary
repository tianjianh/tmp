The family of a 106-year-old woman refused a vote at her polling station have said she is "devastated".

Win Hawkins was turned away from her local booth in the Monmouth constituency on Thursday by officials who said she was not registered.
Her family claim she was wrongly listed as Arwen, although her full name is Amy Winifred Hawkins.
Monmouthshire council officials said they would ensure Mrs Hawkins is registered for the next election.
One of her granddaughters, Tamzin Powell, said: "She always votes, and she did at the last election in 2015.
"Gran is pretty good for 106, but she was devastated. She's been a Labour voter all her life and this might have been her last chance".
Ms Powell, an academic, said the family believed the problem might be related to a verification process.
But they believe there should not have been a problem because an official had previously visited her grandmother's house to check her details.
Mrs Hawkins's mother was a suffragette who campaigned for votes for women.
In a Facebook video posted by her family, Mrs Hawkins said:  "I was born in 1911, I've seen two world wars, I've seen votes for women, I've seen pensions for all, I've seen the miners' strike.
"And today they wouldn't let me vote."
Paul Matthews, Monmouthshire council's chief executive and returning officer for the Monmouth constituency, said: "It's unfortunate that Mrs Hawkins was unable to vote yesterday.
"But if you aren't on the electoral register, which is constantly updated, you are not entitled to a vote.
"That is the law of the land."
Monmouth was held by the Conservative David Davies with an 8,200 majority.
