Plans for a follow-up to the hit 1986 film were announced last year, but it was not known if and how much the star would be involved.
Speaking to MTV, Cruise said he was in talks with director Tony Scott and would go ahead provided they could "find a story that we all want to do".
"I hope we can figure this out to do it again," he said.
Scott directed Cruise in the first Top Gun film, which propelled him to fame as fighter pilot Maverick.
The Jerry Bruckheimer-produced film, which also starred Kelly McGillis and Val Kilmer, was nominated for four Oscars and won the best song Academy Award for Take My Breath Away.
Cruise said: "I said to Tony, I want to make another movie with him. He and I haven't made a film since Days Of Thunder."
"Tony and I and Jerry, we never thought that we would do it again. Then they started to come to us with these ideas and I thought, wow, that would be what we could do now.
"We all want to make a film that is in the same kind of tone as the other one and shoot it in the same way as we shot Top Gun," he added.
It had been rumoured that Cruise's character would return in the sequel as an instructor for a new class of Top Gun recruits.
But when asked what his role would be in a new film, the actor said: "I don't know - we're working on it."
Cruise will next be seen on screen in a fourth Mission: Impossible film, Ghost Protocol.
