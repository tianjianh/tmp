[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Students from the University of Glasgow have spent the past week removing hundreds of tonnes of mud from the Cochno Stone at Faiffley in Clydebank.
Now a fire crew has been brought in to wash mud from the sandstone slab, which is covered with dozens of Neolithic cup and ring marks.
Specialists from the Factum Foundation will scan it to produce a replica.
The stone was deliberately buried in the 1960s because of concern at the damage it was suffering.
At the moment the plan is to re-bury it once it has been scanned and digitally recorded.
