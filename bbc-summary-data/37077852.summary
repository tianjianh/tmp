Liam Pitchford and Paul Drinkhall each lost in the singles and Drinkhall and Sam Walker were beaten in the doubles as China progressed 3-0.
Great Britain won bronze at the World Team Championships in March.
China, winners of 24 of the 28 Olympic table tennis golds ever awarded, play in Monday's semi-finals at 19:00 BST.
"Our results as a team are on the up so I think table tennis in Britain is in a great place. Hopefully we can keep building on that," said Drinkhall.
"We're definitely looking at Tokyo 2020. It was a tough draw here against China but I think we all believe that if that happens again in Tokyo then we'll go to beat them.
"As a team we've got great team spirit and individually we're improving a lot. I think we've got the best team spirit in table tennis."
