The 23-year-old arrives from French club La Rochelle, where he had been on loan from Sydney's North Harbour Rays.
"He is a wing with exceptional pace and has, this past season, gained valuable experience in the Top 14," said Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons.
"I believe he will add a vital edge to our attack and look forward to having him with us next season."
La Rochelle recruited Northam as medical cover for Samoa international Alofa Alofa in September.
He made five appearances for the Top 14 club, including three European fixtures.
"The boys here have told me the club's moving in the right direction and they've got a good team atmosphere," he said.
"What am I looking to add to the mix? I'm hoping to bring my speed and pace to the game, to execute and finish on some of the backline plays."
