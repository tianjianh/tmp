High time at Wilderness Festival

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
With hot tubs, lake swimming and yoga sessions as well as headliners Bjork and George Clinton, Wilderness, which took place in Oxfordshire this weekend, is among a new breed of festivals offering more than just music.

While most festivalgoers want to be entertained, ticket-holders at Wilderness are likely to be roped in to be part of the entertainment themselves.
La Fura dels Baus, an arts group from Barcelona, found 43 people - who had never done anything like this before - to take part in an aerial spectacle in which they created a stunning human net.
"It was really scary for them, I think, because they didn't realise it was 70m (230ft) high," Wilderness creative director Jo Vidler says. "One guy actually had a panic attack and we had to bring him down."
But she adds: "Participation is really important for us, and the reason for that is that we find, when you spectate, you don't really learn very much. You don't take away as much of a memory as if you participated in it."
It the aerial spectacle sounds a bit daunting, there were opportunities to get involved in other ways - be it by paddle-boarding in the lake, singing, doing yoga, writing fiction, cooking or painting.
There were also debates and talks on themes like Wilderness School of Thought, How to Make Love Last and How to Stay Calm.
Getting involved is not just a great leveller (many are beginners to these activities) but a way to relax, meet like-minded souls and, yes, learn something.
The lake is literally and figuratively at the centre of the four-day festival. If the weather is balmy - or least if it doesn't rain - most people want to take advantage of this natural swimming pool.
At times, with more than 400 events laid on for festivalgoers, it did feel overwhelming. There was so much to do and not enough time to do everything, go everywhere or even try what we would have liked.
But Wilderness, which is spread across 1,700 acres of private woodland at Cornbury Park, prides itself on luxury and being family-friendly.
So if you preferred not to get get too hands-on, you were still well catered for - literally.
Every evening, chefs including Raymond Blanc, Angela Hartness, and Niklas Ekstedt laid on five-course banquets for 400 people at a time. These feasts often follow a theme and we became mermaids, dressed by specialist costumer Prangsta in 45 minutes.
Elsewhere, a film called The Triplets of Belleville was accompanied by a live orchestra, and the audience loved the "live" element of the musical accompaniment.
The atmosphere was often one of a family fete, with horse riding and circus sideshows, costumiers and storytelling.
At night, parties started up deep in the woods, the wildest ones being in the Hidden Valley - though partygoers were sworn to secrecy.
And as well as all the other activities, there were even some singers and bands to watch, including Bjork, George Clinton, Nick Mulvey and up-and-coming artist Rhodes.
Rhodes played tracks from his not yet released new album and was delighted to be back after last year's washout. "I want to jump in the lake and swim," he told the BBC.
"I am thankful I don't have to sing in the bar because of the bad weather, as I had to last year."
In fact, music was often given centre stage at Wilderness. But to confine yourself to listening to the bands would have rather missed the point.
