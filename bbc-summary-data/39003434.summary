The company, which installs windows, doors and conservatories, said revenues rose by 2.3% to £21.9m for the 12 months to the end of February.
Pre-tax-profits climbed by 27.7% to £159,000.
The Dunfermline-based firm, which employs nearly 400 people between its domestic and commercial arms, has now posted growth for six successive years.
The firm said its manufacturing business showed "steady improvements" last year as a result of increased demand from new-build developers.
Sales for the division, which employs 90 staff in Cowdenbeath, rose by £200,000 to £7.5m.
CR Smith executive chairman Gerard Eadie said: "We have progressively invested in both the manufacturing and sales operations to keep pace with customer demand, on both the domestic and commercial side of the business.
"Our commercial business is steadily growing. We have a strong proposition for new-build developers including a high-quality bespoke product, delivered reliably and efficiently because of the investment made and capabilities of our factory.
"As we continue to market ourselves to this sector, we can see the commercial arm of CR Smith expanding and have been planning accordingly."
