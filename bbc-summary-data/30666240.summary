The musician, who is the only person to have won the prestigious Mercury Prize twice, will be joined in the box by her band, producers and engineers.
The enclosed box will have one-way glazing so they will have no idea when people are watching.
The sessions could be anything from improvisation to recording a bass drum.
"I want Recording in Progress to operate as if we're an exhibition in a gallery," she said.
"I hope people will see the attention and the labour and the care that goes into making a recording. I hope people will see the interactions between everyone involved."
The box will be situated in the New Wing, which was once used as the Inland Revenue's staff gym and rifle range.
The Devon-born musician's last release, 2011's Let England Shake, a collection of songs inspired by conflicts around the world, was her second Mercury winner, taking the prize for the best album of the year 10 years after Stories From The City, Stories From The Sea was honoured.
