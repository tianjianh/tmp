[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two tries from Josh Mantellato helped Hull KR rescue a draw with Castleford in their opening Super League game.

Denny Solomona crossed to put Tigers ahead, but James Donaldson went over to level the scores before half-time.
Jake Webster drove over for Castleford after a scrum deep in Rovers territory, before Josh Mantellato touched down to reduce the deficit to two points.
Webster scored again to extend the lead to six, but Mantellato's second try and successful conversion secured a point.
In wet and windy conditions, the visitors looked to have the game won until Mantellato's last-minute effort.
The Italy winger went over just inside the touchline, before he struck a difficult kick through the uprights to level the scores.
Rovers, who secured their Super League status by topping the Qualifiers table in 2015, matched the visitors throughout the game, but fell behind three times after they failed to deal with attacks down the left wing.
Tigers could have sealed the win when Solomona was held up by Ben Cockayne moments before Mantellato went over, but Daryl Powell's side were forced to settle for the draw.

Hull KR head coach Chris Chester:
"Considering Josh Mantellato's only got one eye that's open he did a fantastic job at kicking that goal.
"I was pleased with the defensive side of the game but we were a long way off where we needed to be with the ball.
"I'm really proud of the resilience and toughness of the boys. From one to 17 the effort was first class."
Castleford head coach Daryl Powell:
"I have to give credit to Hull KR who have copped a load of stick in recent weeks.
"We were just a bit dumb; we had the game. It was pretty tight all the way through in real tough conditions.
"I thought we worked really hard but a couple of brain explosions from some players hurt us.
"We need to pick ourselves up and be a fair bit better than that. That was a disappointing effort today."
