[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dawson Willcock was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, a rare form of liver cancer, in January but chemotherapy has failed to help him.
A charity box, containing a "considerable amount" of cash to pay for treatment in the US has been stolen from a play centre in Sutton-In-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.
Police have released CCTV images following the theft.
Dawson's mother Wendy, 41, said she was so disappointed.
"I don't know how much they got away with, but whatever that amount was there is nothing they could spend that money on that is more valuable and more important than the life of a 21-month-old.
"Nothing. They can't buy anything more precious than that."
Dawson's parents, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, are hoping to raise Â£500,000 to take him to the US.
A break-in happened at Jimmy Beans Children's Play and Party Centre in the early hours of 22 June. Money was also stolen from the till and another charity box.
Police said "a considerable amount" of money was in the two collection boxes.
Officers describe the offenders as white males, aged 16 to 22 years, of slim build and 5ft 8ins to 5ft 10ins tall. They were wearing dark clothing and face coverings, with one also wearing a dark baseball cap.
Sgt Geoff Brown, the officer in the case, said: "Stealing is a despicable crime but to steal from a charity is utterly heartless. There was a considerable amount of money in the collection boxes.
"We are determined to trace the persons responsible and are urging anybody with any information to report it to us as soon as possible."
