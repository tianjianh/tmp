Yorkshire v Somerset: Liam Plunkett & Ryan Sidebottom injured as visitors get on top

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset built a healthy lead on the third day against Yorkshire, who were without injured seamers Liam Plunkett and Ryan Sidebottom at Scarborough.

Plunkett, who took 4-73 in Somerset's first innings, was unable to bowl because of a suspected groin injury, while Sidebottom has a back problem.
Tim Rouse (69) and James Hildreth (85 not out) shared 144 as the visitors closed on 234-3, a lead of 289.
Yorkshire had earlier been dismissed for 213 after resuming on 159-7.
Adil Rashid was the last man out for 49 - the home side's biggest contributor - while Sidebottom did at least manage to bat at number 11.
But he was unable to feature at all with the ball, while England fast bowler Plunkett's workload was limited to only six overs at the start of Somerset's innings.
Despite already holding a 55-run lead, the loss of opener Edward Byrom (40) at 80-2 had left the game still marginally in the balance.
But Hildreth's 111-ball 85, his first 50 of the summer, and Rouse's maiden half-century for Somerset put the visitors in control heading into day four.
