John Brown, from Swindon, took to the skies near Cirencester strapped to a 1940's bi-plane.
He did the wing walk in memory of his wife Thelma, who died a few years ago, and also to raise money for Wiltshire Air Ambulance.
"Fantastic - I wouldn't have missed it for the world," he said afterwards. "It was so exhilarating and nothing I'd ever experienced before it was absolutely phenomenal."
