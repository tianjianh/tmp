Organisers said paper folding skills, accuracy and athleticism were all judged during the competition in Burnham-On-Sea on Sunday.
Entrants had to create their own paper planes from a single sheet of paper.
The high street was turned into a makeshift runway for the event. The winner, Syed Hassan, from Surrey, threw his plane 31.4m (103 ft).
Mr Hassan, 43, said he was "really pleased" to have won.
"This was the first time I had taken part in anything like this and after my first flight I was determined to win," he said.
"I was sure my design could go the distance, I just had to judge the wind right.
"I probably flew my paper plane over 20 times, but when it went out over 30 metres I was over the moon."
Town centre manager said the aim of the "family-focussed, fun event", organised by Burnham and Highbridge Town Council, was to bring people into the town centre.
Organisers said 1,108 people took part, aged between three and 87 years old.
The current Guinness World Record for the furthest flight by a paper aircraft is 69.14 meters (226 feet 10 inches).
It was achieved by Americans Joe Ayoob and John M Collins, an aircraft designer, at McClellan Air Force Base in California on 26 February 2012.
