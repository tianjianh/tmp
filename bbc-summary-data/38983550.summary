Manchester Crown Court heard the body of Sian Roberts, 36, was found at a flat in Salford in November 2015.
Police said after the prints were found, Glynn Williams "tried everything to get out of admitting his crimes".
The 53-year-old from Crumpsall, Manchester, was ordered to serve a minimum of 21 years in prison.
Supt Bob Tonge said the story Williams told officers "changed more than once" throughout the investigation.
"I'm glad we've finally got Sian's family the justice they deserve", he added.
Speaking after sentencing on Wednesday, Ms Roberts' daughter Shantay said her mum's life "might have been short-lived, but it was most definitely lived".
She said she had "never known a person to inspire and touch so many different lives in such a crazy and unorthodox way", adding that her "bestest friend in the entire world" was "finally at peace".
