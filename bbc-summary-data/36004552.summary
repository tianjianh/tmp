"We know the performance wasn't good enough.
"I wouldn't say it was down to lack of effort, we just never got into a tempo, we never raised the game and they caused us problems all day.
"It's about having a winning mentality - no matter what stage of the season, no matter who we are playing.
"I think a few took their eye off the ball, which is disappointing for the fans because they've paid good money to watch these boys."
