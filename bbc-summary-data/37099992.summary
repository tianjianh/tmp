Plans have been submitted for a museum in the Borders celebrating the achievements of two-time Formula One world champion Jim Clark.

A total project cost of about £1.65m has been attached to the scheme.
It would see the existing Jim Clark Room in Duns expanded and enhanced to let cars and trophies go on display.
A design statement accompanying the planning application describes it as an "exciting opportunity" to raise the profile of the Scottish sporting hero.
Scottish Borders Council has already committed almost £620,000 to the scheme with a similar sum being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
A minimum of £300,000 has been set as a target for community fundraising.
"It is envisaged that the redeveloped museum will attract more tourists and motor racing enthusiasts alike thus contributing to the local economy and the Scottish Borders generally," said the design statement.
"The proposed alterations respect the original design of the building, whilst also addressing issues with the condition of its fabric, by creating a contemporary, fit-for-purpose visitor attraction for the 21st Century."
It is hoped the development could be completed by 2018 - the 50th anniversary of Clark's death at Hockenheim in Germany, aged just 32.
The driver was born in Kilmany in Fife, but raised in the Borders, and was crowned Formula One world champion in 1963 and 1965. He won a total of 25 grand prix races.
