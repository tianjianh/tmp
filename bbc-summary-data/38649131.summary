Flanker Warburton's six-year tenure ended as coach Rob Howley named seven uncapped players in his 36-man squad.
Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Wasps flanker Thomas Young and Newport Gwent Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt are among the uncapped call-ups.
Welsh exiles George North, Jamie Roberts and Taulupe Faletau continue as "wildcard" picks.
Warburton first captained Wales in 2011, and became the youngest player to lead them at a World Cup later that year.
He has won 69 caps for Wales, a record 49 as captain, and also skippered the British and Irish Lions.

Ospreys captain Jones, 31, has often deputised for the Cardiff Blues player, including for the Lions' third Test win over Australia in 2013, when Warburton was injured.
Jones has won 105 caps for Wales, and six for the Lions and Howley said: "He is the first name on the team-sheet."
Howley said he has spoken to Warburton about him switching from open to blind-side of the back-row and highlighted the strength of back-row competition he faced.
Howley is deputising for Warren Gatland while the New Zealander prepares to take the Lions to face the All Blacks in June.
The current Wales coach says Gatland backed his decision over the captaincy and hopes Warburton "can get his mojo back".
"I spoke to Sam and he agreed it was the best decision for him," said Howley.
"He is a world class player and we want him to be the best he can be."
Howley added: "It's an honour to select Alun Wyn as captain.
"His vast experience, as a player and a leader will help drive this squad forward and I believe he will flourish in the role."
Howley praised Warburton for the "great success" he has had as Wales captain.
He added: "We want him to concentrate on his game and to be the best player he can be.
"No player is guaranteed their place in an international team and we want Sam to be playing his very best rugby and he agrees this is the best way forward."

North, Roberts and Faletau fall under the so-called "Gatland's Law", which limits to three the number of affected Welsh exiles Howley can select this season.
The Welsh Rugby Union's (WRU) senior player selection policy (SPSP) means only three players who play outside Wales can be picked.
Japan-based Dominic Day and Bristol scrum-half Rhodri Williams are the others affected.
However, Bath lock Charteris, Young, Williams, Gloucester back-row Ross Moriarty and Exeter prop Tomas Francis are not captured by the rule.
Young, 24, has impressed this season under his father Dai - a former Wales prop and captain - at Wasps.
Along with Ospreys' Justin Tipuric and Gloucester flanker Ross Moriarty, Young is putting pressure on Warburton, 28, for a starting spot.
Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb makes the squad having not played since injuring an ankle in Wales' November defeat by Australia.
Howley says Webb will play some part for Ospreys in the European Challenge Cup at Newcastle on Saturday as he completes his recovery.
The uncapped contingent are Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Hewitt, Aled Davies and Young.
Only Davies and Thornton have previously been in senior Wales squads.
In the absence of veteran record Wales cap-holder prop Gethin Jenkins (calf), Wales welcome back Scarlets loose-head Rob Evans after injury.
Jenkins, 36, has amassed 129 Wales caps and five more for the Lions.
Howley said after the hamstring injury suffered by 18-year-old Ospreys wing Keelan Giles at the weekend, he felt it was in the player's "best interests" not to pick him.
"We don't know how significant the injury is," added Howley.
