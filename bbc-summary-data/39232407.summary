Humberside Police launches hunt for new chief constable

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An advert for a new chief constable of Humberside has urged candidates not to let "preconceived ideas" about the region "get in the way".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The video advert asks applicants to "look properly at the area" and ignore its "recent past of declining fishing ports and related industries".
Former chief Justine Curran stood down after inspectors criticised the force.
Police and Crime Commissioner Keith Hunter said he hoped to attract an "exceptional individual".

The force was told by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in November that it "requires improvement".
In October 2015 the force was the only one rated inadequate in a review of police efficiency across England and Wales.
After he was elected in May 2016, Mr Hunter gave Ms Curran six months to convince him "that there is a plan".
Ms Curran, had been due to retire in September 2018, but announced her departure last month, saying the "time is right" to leave.
In the advert Mr Hunter said the area was a "region with ambition" that was starting to "realise its untapped potential".
He highlighted Hull's status as UK City of Culture 2017, the city's Premier League football team and top flight rugby league offering, as well as "housing prices so low they astound newcomers".
The job is advertised with an annual salary of up to Â£159,244.
