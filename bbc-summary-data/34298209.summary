The Rochdale-based comic has tweeted that the Pope has made him a papal knight for services to charity.
The 69-year-old said he was "thrilled" to receive the honour that he will officially receive at a later date.
Born in Cookstown in County Tyrone, the comedian, whose real name is James Joseph Mulgrew, became a household name in the 1970s.
The former Butlin's red coat entertainer told BBC Radio Ulster the honour had come "right out of the blue".
The father-of-four only became aware of the award when his parish priest arrived at his home to deliver what he thought was a 70th birthday card.
"The parish priest arrived and took out this certificate - it was a papal knighthood and it was in Latin," Mr Cricket said.
"I thought: 'He's got the wrong fella here, is he sure it's not the neighbour?'
He said he was "humbled and honoured" by the recognition.
"I do what I love. If I can raise money by entertaining people, sure it's not hard work.
"To get an honour for doing something that you love is quite a blessing."
