The five month year-old calf, called Clear Sky, got her leg caught in an animal trap laid by villagers to protect their crops.
She's is the first elephant to get this kind of water therapy.
Baby elephants usually love water but she was a little nervous going in. Her vet has said that she's already showing signs of improvement.
