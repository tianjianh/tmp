New York Representative Michael Grimm said he would "break" a cable news journalist who brought up an investigation into his campaign funds.
Mr Grimm said his behaviour toward NY1's Michael Scotto was "wrong".
"I shouldn't have allowed my emotions to get the better of me and lose my cool," he said.
After cutting Tuesday night's interview short, the congressman told Scotto: "You ever do that to me again I'll throw you off this [expletive] balcony."
When Scotto said he had a valid question, Mr Grimm replied: "No, no, you're not man enough, you're not man enough. I'll break you in half. Like a boy."
NY1 political director Bob Hardt had demanded an apology from the politician.
The Staten Island Republican initially said he was "extremely annoyed" with Scotto and doubted he was the "first member of Congress to tell off a reporter".
Later on Wednesday, Mr Grimm said in a statement that his apology to Scotto had been "graciously accepted".
The FBI earlier this month charged an associate of the congressman with bypassing federal campaign laws to funnel contributions to his political committee.
