Stars from Strictly Come Dancing, the Royal Ballet and Sir Matthew Bourne's New Adventures company will take part in Gala for Grenfell on 30 July.
Phillips said the disaster had made her "wonder if there was a way I could help [and] maybe make a small difference".
Tickets for the event at the Adelphi Theatre in London go on sale on 7 July.
Akram Khan, Adam Garcia and The Mariinsky Ballet are among other members of the dance community who have been lined up to appear.
Proceeds will go to The Kensington & Chelsea Foundation, the independent charity running the Grenfell Tower Fund.
In a statement, Phillips said the news coverage of the fire had been "so powerful you can't move".
"I thought dance is my world, my life, so how could I galvanise and bring the dance community together to raise funds for those who need it most, now and into the future?"
Police believe at least 80 people died when fire engulfed Grenfell Tower in North Kensington in the early hours of 14 June.
Other fundraising initiatives have included an all-star version of Bridge Over Troubled Water that topped the singles chart on its release last month.
