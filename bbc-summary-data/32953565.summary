Bus lane cameras come into operation in Belfast

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast's new bus lane cameras come into operation on Monday but for the next three weeks drivers will be warned, not fined, for using the lanes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Six cameras have been installed in the city centre to catch drivers who use bus lanes illegally.
The "honeymoon period" begins on Monday but fines will be imposed from 21 June.
It is anticipated that more than 10,000 drivers a year will be caught by the new state-of-the-art cameras, which use number-plate recognition technology.
Drivers caught illegally using bus lanes could be fined up to Â£90.
The scheme, run by Stormont's Department of Regional Development, is expected to raise about Â£500,000 a year.
