A 24-year-old woman from Derry, captured on camera being left in a bus lay-by by two police officers, has been charged in connection with the incident.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bridget Patricia Mongan from Stanley's Walk appeared at Londonderry Magistrate's Court on Monday.
She has been charged with assaulting her boyfriend, obstructing a police officer and with disorderly behaviour.
The case has been adjourned until 14 April.
The offences are alleged to have been committed in the build up to the incident at John Street on St. Patrick's Day 2014.
The defendant's boyfriend, Martin McLaughlin, 42, from Lisnafin Park in Strabane is charged with disorderly behaviour, obstructing a police officer and with assaulting Ms Mongan, also in John Street on the same day.
Defence solicitor Seamus Quigley told the judge that both defendants denied assaulting one another but they pleaded guilty to obstruction and disorderly behaviour charges.
He said it was a case "which falls into the domestic violence category".
Ms Mongan admits being drunk at the time, but said the two police officers should have left her on the pavement.
They have since been moved from any duties that bring them into direct contact with the public and the Police Ombudsman is investigating the incident.
