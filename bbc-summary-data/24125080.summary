[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christina Edkins, 16, was attacked on the number nine bus at Five Ways in Edgbaston, Birmingham in March.
The garden has been built at Miss Edkins' former school, St Edmund's Catholic Primary.
The charity Wooden Spoon has given Â£8,000 of the Â£10,000 needed to build the garden in the grounds of the school in Roseberry Street, Spring Hill.
The rest of the money was raised by school pupils and the police.
Miss Edkins was on her way to Leasowes High School to take an exam when she was killed by a single stab wound.
Family and friends have been invited to the opening of the garden on 3 October.
A spokesman for Wooden Spoon, which is run by the Rugby Football Union, said: "The Christina Edkins Memorial Garden will be a lasting tribute to a gifted and talented young lady."
The garden will be opened by former England rugby player Phil Vickery.
A man from Walsall is currently detained at a secure mental health unit, accused of killing Miss Edkins.
