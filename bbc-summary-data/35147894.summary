Barnsley registered their first home league victory since September with a win over fellow strugglers Blackpool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Winnall headed in from close range before Mark Cullen struck back for Blackpool after the break.
Winnall tapped home Lloyd Isgrove's cross as Barnsley regained the lead before Marley Watkins slotted a third.
Andy Little's late strike gave Blackpool hope but Matt Templeton fired low into the bottom corner as the Tykes moved out of League One's drop zone.
Prior to the game, Barnsley confirmed the signing of 17-year-old left-back Rhys Dolan from non-league Ilkeston Town for an undisclosed fee, on a contract to run until the summer of 2018.
