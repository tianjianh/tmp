[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old man was walking home along Lamont Way in Knightsbridge, at about 03:50 on Saturday when he was assaulted by a group of youths.
He was treated at St John's Hospital for cuts and bruises to his face and was later released.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the seemingly unprovoked attack to come forward.
Det Con Ally Urquhart, of Police Scotland, said: "This appears to be an unprovoked attack on a lone man and as a result he received a number of serious injuries.
"We are appealing to anyone who may have been in Lamont Way around this time to get in touch if they have any information which may help us identify these youths."
