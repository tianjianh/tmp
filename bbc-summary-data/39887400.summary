[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City manager Kenny Shiels wants his players to rediscover their goal-scoring form as they look to return to winning ways in the Premier Division.

Following a scoreless draw against Galway United on Monday, the Candystripes are on the road as they visit Limerick this weekend.
Striker Rory Patterson remains out with an ankle fracture and midfielder Lukas Schubert is also unavailable.
Saturday's match is one of five away fixtures Derry must play this month.
Patterson is expected to return to action in mid-June and in the continued absence of his leading striker, Shiels has urged the rest of his players to become more ruthless in front of goal.
Having scored just 20 goals from their opening 12 games, Derry's league position is built on their defence, which is the third best in the league, and an away record that has seen them lose just once on the road so far this campaign.
"What the crowd pay their money for should be the priority of all clubs and our priority is to try and give them some satisfaction for making a journey and paying their money to go and support us," Shiels said. "In return, we want to provide entertainment and good quality of play."
"We're looking for a European [qualification] position. We're three points off second and we have to get through this period where we've four away games in the space of five matches. It's a period when we have to start getting wins and looking to build. If we can win [in Limerick] then we've got seven points off our last three games, which is good batting."
Limerick are just three points behind Derry going into this weekend's match and Shiels has warned his players they are facing a tough and well organised side.
"I still say they're one of the best teams in the league in terms of what they produce and their entertainment level," Shiels said. "They certainly are good at retaining the ball and they're a bit like ourselves in some respect. I've seen them dominate games and not win."
"The Sligo game [a 3-0 defeat] was a one-off for them and other than that they've dominated their last five games."
"I want to go there to win and the Derry people know that. Surely it gives them a good feeling that they're going to watch their team play good football and go out to win the game if they can."
