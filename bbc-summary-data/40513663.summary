The 20-year-old starts at full-back, while older brothers Beauden and Scott are at fly-half and on the bench.
Ngani Laumape earns his first start at 12, Israel Dagg plays on the right wing and Julian Savea returns on the left.
Captain and number eight Kieran Read will win his 100th cap, with the three-Test series level at 1-1 .
The Lions name their squad at 20:00 BST.
The All Blacks won the first Test, before the Lions fought back to defeat a New Zealand side reduced to 14 men in the second.
Sonny Bill Williams was subsequently banned for four weeks after being sent off for his head-high challenge on Anthony Watson last Saturday and, with 24-year-old Laumape filling Williams' place at inside centre, Malakai Fekitoa comes on to the bench.
New Zealand head coach Steve Hansen said he expected the third and final Test to be a "cracker".
"It's the series we expected it to be, as the Lions have quality players," he added.
"It now comes down to this Saturday - the winner takes all - and that'll create its own unique pressures and it's going to be interesting to see how both sides cope with it."
New Zealand team to face Lions: Jordie Barrett; Israel Dagg, Anton Lienert-Brown, Ngani Laumape, Julian Savea; Beauden Barrett, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Owen Franks, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Jerome Kaino, Sam Cane, Kieran Read.
Replacements: Nathan Harris, Wyatt Crockett, Charlie Faumuina, Scott Barrett, Ardie Savea, TJ Perenara, Aaron Cruden, Malakai Fekitoa.
