Kent Police are piecing together the pair's last movements and have discovered they were in London on 22 December and in Dover on Boxing Day.
Three bodies were found at the bottom of the cliffs on New Year's Day.
The third was a 45-year-old man from Manchester whose death is not connected to the others.
None of the deaths is being treated as suspicious.
Det Sgt Stuart Ward said the man and woman were believed to be twins, aged 59, from the Elton area of Cheshire.
He said officers were keen to establish whether they were staying locally.
"We have already contacted local hotels but are now asking owners of guest houses, bed and breakfasts and pubs to contact us," he said.
Police also want to hear from anyone who saw the pair, who were wearing dark, wet weather clothing, at the top of Langdon Cliffs between Boxing Day and New Year's Day.
The 45-year-old man who died has been formally identified and his family informed, police said. The other two have not yet been named.
Rescue teams including coastguards and a lifeboat found the bodies during a search on New Year's Day.
