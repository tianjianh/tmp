[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final of Pitch Battle is hitting our screens tonight, with six singing groups fighting it out to win!

The last few groups will face off against each other on the live final in what is sure to be a nerve-wracking show.
Judges Gareth Malone and Kelis, alongside with guest judge Deke Sharon, will then cut the remaining six down to two final contenders.
The winner is then decided by a public vote.
So who is in the running to be crowned 'Pitch Battle Champions'? Let's have a look at the groups...
First on our list are Scot Soul who sailed into the final after impressing the guest judge, singer Chaka Khan on last week's show. The five piece from Loch Lomond sang the hit song 'Ain't Nobody' which Chaka made famous in the 1980's.
Next up, Tring Park 16 - a chamber choir from Tring Park School of Performing Arts. Tring Park 16 won over guest judge Joe Jonas, with their version of his song 'Kissing Strangers' to get through to the final. Judge Kelis said of the group, "they're young, they're vibrant, and they're extremely skilled." We will have to wait and see if they have what it takes to win.
The Portsmouth University Gospel choir bagged themselves a place in tonight's final with a heart-string-pulling cover of Seal's 'Kiss From a Rose' in front of the man himself who made the song a hit.
The group of eight from West Yorkshire saw off strong competition and snapped up a place in the finals with their version of Evergreen by Will Young. A choir member said "We don't know what to say! We are never lost for words and don't know what to say but thanks to everyone, thanks!"
From London, All the King's Men beat Sgarmes to score a place in the finals. The boys sang Bebe Rexah's 'Take Me Home' and even though the judges said it was a really hard decision they eventually picked the London nine piece.
Despite losing to All the King's Men, Sgarmes, from Wales, were chosen to come back as the wild card.
The wild card is a group that lost but the judges liked enough to bring back for the finals!
