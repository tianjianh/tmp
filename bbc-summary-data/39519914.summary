[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glamorgan have signed Harry Podmore on loan from Middlesex to ease the county's fast bowling injury concerns.

The seamer goes straight into the squad for the opening County Championship match at Northampton on Friday.
The Welsh county are set to give a debut to South African paceman Marchant de Lange but are missing four of last season's seamers.
It is a second Glamorgan loan period for Podmore, 22, after he spent a stint last season in Wales.
Front-line bowlers Timm van der Gugten (shoulder), Graham Wagg (groin), Michael Hogan (hip) and Ruaidhri Smith (abdominal tear) are all missing along with batsman Will Bragg (back).
Podmore will be available for an initial period of a month including three Championship games, while teenager Lukas Carey could get an early season chance.
"Harry proved himself a reliable option on loan last season and has continued to take wickets for Middlesex," said Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris.
"He's developed from working with the England fast bowling programme to become a young, but high calibre fast bowler who will add depth to our seam attack.
"Although we've added Marchant de Lange to the squad, we've suffered some injuries to our bowlers with Ruaidhri Smith, Graham Wagg, Timm van der Gugten and Michael Hogan all missing pre-season fixtures and unavailable for tomorrow's game.
"So the bowling department needs strengthening in the short term."
Batsman Colin Ingram is set play his first championship match for Glamorgan since 2015 following knee surgery last August, while wicketkeeper Chris Cooke returns after missing most of last season with back trouble.
Glamorgan (from):  J Rudolph (capt), N Selman, D Lloyd, C Ingram, C Cooke, A Donald, K Carlson, C Meschede, O Morgan, A Salter, M De Lange, L Carey, H Podmore.
