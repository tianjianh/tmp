[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About one in five schools in Yorkshire and Humber region needs improving, according to government inspectors.

Ofsted's latest report said the region had the largest proportion of schools requiring work, compared to other areas in England.
It also found the region had the lowest number of schools rated as outstanding or good.
Nick Hudson, from Ofsted, said the profile of schools in the region was lower compared to others in England.
The findings were based on inspections of 21,050 educational institutions, including nurseries, primary and secondary schools, special schools and pupil referral units, across England from 1 October to 31 December.
It follows a report in December which found secondary schools in Yorkshire and Humber were among the worst in the country.
Out of 2,145 schools inspected, 453 required improvement and 62 were deemed inadequate.
The report states 65 of Bradford's 201 schools need improving, along with 42 of the 141 schools inspected in Doncaster.
In East Yorkshire, 41 out of 148 schools need improvement as well as 17 of the 58 schools in North East Lincolnshire.
Councillor Ralph Berry, executive member for children's services at City of Bradford Council, said urgent action was being taken to drive up school standards.
The report has prompted criticism from former Ofsted inspector Marvyn Moore, from Sheffield, who said the inspection process was deeply flawed.
He said: "The outcome of inspections depended on the registered inspector who was leading the inspection and whether they wanted a quick job... whether they wanted a thorough job or were thoroughly disenchanted with the school."
Mr Hudson said parents relied on inspections to make decisions on which schools to send children.
He added: "Ninety per cent of feedback after inspections say head teachers are satisfied with the inspection process."
