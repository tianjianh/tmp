Briton held on suspicion of wife's murder in France

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Conservative councillor has been placed under investigation in south-west France on suspicion of murdering his wife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Turtle, 62, was arrested after the body of his 50-year-old wife Stephanie was found beneath a car by firefighters on Friday morning.
Mr Turtle served on Bournemouth Council from May 2015 to July 2016.
He and his wife moved to Prayssac in the Lot department last year to set up a guest house.
He was placed under investigation for aggravated murder after telling police he argued with his wife, but her death was an accident.
A post-mortem examination found Mrs Turtle died of asphyxia after being crushed.
Mr Turtle served as a councillor for Bournemouth's Kinson North ward.
Commenting at the time of his resignation, he said: "It's been a privilege serving Bournemouth Council and the residents of Kinson North, but I've taken the personal decision to live abroad."
On a blog the couple set up about their move to France, Mrs Turtle wrote on 23 July last year: "So here we are at the beginning of a whole new chapter in our lives, in our new house, in Prayssac, south west France and very excited and nervous we are too!"
A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth office said it was supporting the family of Mrs Turtle.
