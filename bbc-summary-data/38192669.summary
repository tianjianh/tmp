[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County 0-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wycombe overcame Notts County as both teams were reduced to 10 men in an ill-tempered League Two clash.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wycombe arrived having won their last six games in all competitions and took a lead into the half-time break thanks to Adebayo Akinfenwa.
Notts County had not won any of their last five league games and saw Michael O'Connor sent off before half-time, with Kashket wrapping up the points after the break despite Akinfenwa seeing red for the visitors with 13 minutes left.
Jon Stead almost grabbed an impressive opener for the hosts, although his curling effort sailed narrowly wide of the far post.
The visitors took the lead on 37 minutes after Joe Jacobson was given ample space to float a fantastic ball into the box which was met by the head of Akinfenwa.
County's woes worsened as the first half came to a close when O'Connor saw red after lunging into a 50/50 tackle.
Wycombe dubiously doubled their lead 10 minutes into the second half after Kashket, who netted three times in last weekend's 5-0 FA Cup win at Chesterfield, slotted home from what looked to be an offside position, with home manager John Sheridan sent to the stands for his protests.
The game was not to end without further controversy as Akinfenwa was sent off late on after a second yellow.
