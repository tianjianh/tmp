The incident began when three men approached a silver Citroen Berlingo while it was sitting at traffic lights in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire.
Two of the men used hammers to smash the windscreen and passenger window.
The victim managed to drive off but was pursued "at speed" by the men in a white Audi before he lost them.
Police said they believed it was a targeted attack.
The incident started on Thursday at about 20:15 at a set of traffic lights on Park Road, Milngavie, directly outside the Royal Mail sorting office.
Police said three men got out of a nearby white Audi, possibly an S3 model, while one man remained in the driver's seat.
One man, who was wearing a blue hooded top, approached the victim's nearside passenger window and smashed it with a hammer.
A second man wearing a grey T-shirt then smashed the windscreen.
The victim managed to drive off, and the three men got back into the car with the driver and followed him along Clober Road into Craigton Road and onto Hunter Road, before turning into Craigdhu Road and back onto Park Road.
The victim then turned right onto Milngavie Road and travelled south onto Maryhill Road, where he managed to lose the men.
Det Sgt Alan Cuthbert, from Maryhill CID, said: "This was a frightening incident for the victim who luckily managed to escape uninjured.
"It is critical we trace those responsible as soon as possible as their actions were extremely dangerous and not only put the victim at risk, but other drivers in the area as well.  However we do believe that this was a targeted attack.
"The roads would have been busy around the time of the incident and I would appeal to any drivers or pedestrians who witnessed was happened to get in touch with officers."
