Chester FC: Luke George and Kane Richards sign new contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke George and Kane Richards have both signed new one-year contracts with National League club Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder George, 23, joined from Southport last season, but was restricted to 23 appearances this term because of injuries.
Former Derby forward Richards, 21, scored three goals in the final six games of the season to help Blues stay in non-league football's top flight.
"There's a real prospect," boss Jon McCarthy told the club website.
"Everybody saw Kane's potential at the end of this season. He played a big part in keeping us up."
On George, McCarthy added: "He is a leader - his drive and ambition makes him a hungry player."
