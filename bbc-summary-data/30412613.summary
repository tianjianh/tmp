A reward of £20,000 has been offered to anyone who can help track down the killer of an Oxford University scientist 20 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Michael Meenaghan, 33, was shot through his kitchen window at his home in Oxford on 10 December 1994.
His body was found by police after a 999 call was made from the house just before 16:30 GMT.
The reward, which is valid for three months, has been offered jointly by Crimestoppers and Thames Valley Police.
No one spoke during the 999 call, but someone struggling to breathe was heard.
Dr Meenaghan's mother has urged anyone with information about his death to contact Crimestoppers.
Pat Meenaghan said: "His death is always with me and there is not a day goes by when I don't miss him.
"We still don't know why someone would be so callous as to take his life and rob the world of a lovely man and a gifted scientist."
Police said there was no clear motive for the shooting at Mr Meenaghan's home on Monks Close, on the Blackbird Leys Estate.
Peter Beirne, of Thames Valley Police, said: "Possible motives explored over the years have suggested links to Dr Meenaghan's private life, or to his work, or to a case of mistaken identity.
"However there has been a lack of evidence leading to any conclusive motive and we have to keep an open mind as to what that is."
The £10,000 Crimestoppers portion of the reward can only be claimed if information leading to the arrest and conviction of the offender is passed directly to Crimestoppers.
