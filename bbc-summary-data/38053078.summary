[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Sandow has told Warrington Wolves he will not return to the Super League side next season to see out the final year of his contract.

The 27-year-old Australian joined the club in July 2015 after he was released from his deal with Parramatta.
But his agent informed Wolves he would not be returning for the 2017 season.
"Chris should have reported for pre-season training today on 21 November," head of rugby operations Karl Fitzpatrick told the club website.
"This is a clear breach of contract. We will be retaining his registration until further notice.
"The club are disappointed that Chris has decided not to return, we are already underway in monitoring a potential replacement both internally and externally."
