England won the 2017 Under-20s Six Nations title on Saturday after a 33-5 victory over Scotland at Franklin's Gardens, Northampton.

They ran in five tries to Scotland's one but had to wait until the result of Wales' match against Ireland to find out if they had won the title.
Wales's 41-27 win confirmed England as the competition's winners.
England can win the Grand Slam when they take on Ireland in their final game in Dublin on 17 March.
England U20 coach Tom Williams said: "We have sown up the Six Nations title this evening but we all want the Grand Slam - that is what we set out to achieve at the start of the competition.
"Ireland are going to be a real handful next week and it will be a massive game playing for the Grand Slam on St Patrick's Day."
That match will take place the day before the senior England side visit Ireland in a bid for their own Grand Slam, after thrashing Scotland 61-21 on Saturday.
