[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wrexham's supporters, making a round trip of nearly 600 miles, had little to cheer as their side rarely threatened.
The Whites dominated after ex-Newport striker Bird turned-in from close range in the 18th minute after Kane Richards' set-up.
Chris Kinnear's side are sixth in the National League after three games.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "We came with a game plan and for the first 15 minutes it was working very well and ideally we should have been 1-0 up in the opening minutes.
"After they scored it wasn't the reaction we were after if I'm honest. Second half it wasn't anywhere near what it should have been."
