A lorry driver has been jailed for two years after admitting killing a cyclist by careless driving.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mervyn White, 64, of Orion Way, Grimsby, was sentenced after pleading guilty at York Crown Court in July to his role in the death of Julian Barlow.
Mr Barlow, 49, from Pollington, near Goole, died after being hit by a HGV at a roundabout at Eggborough, North Yorkshire in September 2014.
He was taken by air ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary, where he later died.
Speaking outside the court, acting Sgt Zoe Billings said she thought the sentence was "proportionate".
She said: "I think it shows that the judge has taken into account not only the avoidability of this accident, but also Mr White's insistence that he was innocent and refused to take any responsibility for the collision until literally the day before the trial".
