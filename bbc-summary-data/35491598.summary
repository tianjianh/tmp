EnQuest to cut 45 oil and gas jobs in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oil and gas company EnQuest is set to cut 45 posts in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company expects to shed 25 staff and 20 contractor jobs due to what is described as the "ongoing low oil price environment".
EnQuest's president Neil McCulloch said: "We have inevitably been very focused on cost reduction and on production efficiency.
"In this context, we have today proposed additional changes within our onshore organisation in Aberdeen."
He added: "The latest measures regrettably include an anticipated reduction of up to 25 staff positions and 20 contractor roles.
"We will be working closely with those affected in the coming weeks.
"In so streamlining our operations, we are further strengthening EnQuest's position, taking appropriate action to address its priorities in these market conditions."
