Paddy Hill was speaking at a press conference.
The Belfast man was convicted along with five other people of the 1974 bombings which killed 21 people. Those convictions were quashed in 1991.
He accused the "judiciary, the government and the Birmingham police" of "a massive cover-up".
"We never got justice, but I'll tell you one thing that we can get, and that's the one thing we deserve the most, and that's the truth.
"It's not so much me, I know the truth, I want this for the families."
He accused the West Midlands Police of not wanting the inquest to be reopened as "there are too many skeletons in the cupboard".
He alleged police had "advanced warning" of the bombs but "they didn't take any steps to prevent them".
He told journalists he believed he knew who the bombers were.
He added he was sceptical that the full truth of what happened will emerge saying he did not think "the Birmingham police could spell the word truth".
