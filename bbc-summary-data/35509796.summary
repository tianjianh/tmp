The visitors were the more threatening side in the first half and came close to opening the scoring when Jussi Jaaskelainen tipped Carl Winchester's 35-yard strike over the bar.
Oldham goalkeeper Joel Coleman denied Will Grigg a winner by saving his close range effort late on.
The stalemate sees Wigan drop to fourth whilst Oldham remain in 23rd place.

"Probably didn't deserve a point in the end. Oldham played very well and caused us a lot of problems.
"We have to be thankful that we did get the point.
"We can't accept performances like that and we have to do something about it quickly."
Oldham manager John Sheridan told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I'm tremendously proud of the players, the way they've come to probably the best team at this moment in time in our league.
To come and perform like we did was quality from the lads. Every game we go into, we're going to try and win.
"Every player on the pitch played really well today, and it's down to the players at the end of the day."
