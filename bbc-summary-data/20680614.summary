It's a happy hunting ground for reporters with a keen eye and a passion for this amazing subject. And you can easily be one of them. There are millions of science stories under our noses and reporting on them can be great fun and will help you understand and appreciate our beautiful planet. You'll also be able to impress your friends with loads of fabulous facts.
Science was the talk of the town when School Report met one of the world's leading theoretical physicists. Lisa Randall, from Harvard University in America, was in London to discuss the origins of the universe and the reality of multiple dimensions, amongst many other things!
Young people from around the world quizzed her on all of it on 13 December, and it was streamed live on the School Report website.
