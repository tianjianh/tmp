Shocking dashcam footage which shows a motorist making a U-turn before driving straight at a car carrying two children is under review by prosecutors.

The video was captured by Jonathan Steward as he was travelling with his son and daughter on the A140 between Diss and Norwich.
Police are seeking a prosecution for dangerous driving following the incident on 16 September.
The Crown Prosecution Service said it needs more time to consider the case.
The footage shows the Ford car stopping right in front of Mr Steward's vehicle before driving away, turning around and driving head-on towards it, ramming the car twice.
Mr Steward, from Norwich, said it caused Â£4,000 damage to his BMW X5 and left his daughter Holly, 10, "petrified".
He was driving from Woodbridge, Suffolk, to Norwich after picking up his children.
The drama unfolded when he got to the roundabout at Dickleburgh.
He said: "The other driver was in the right-hand lane and I presumed he was turning right but instead he went straight as well.
"I accelerated to get out of the way but the lane narrows and I could see in my rear view mirror that the driver swerved towards me to try and clip back of my car.
"Then he overtook me and slammed on the brakes."
The CPS decided not to consider the case because it felt it would not get a conviction, but Mr Steward appealed against the decision in February.
He said: "You give them dashcam footage, you give them all the evidence. I wonder what it takes to get somebody prosecuted?
"It really upset my kids which is why I'm doing this."
The CPS said it needed another 28 days to review the case.
