Hollywood star Liza Minnelli took a 200-mile taxi ride to get to a concert after her flight was cancelled.

The Cabaret and Arthur star was due to play in Wilmington, North Carolina, last Saturday but her flight turned back after encountering rough weather.
"Her connecting flight from Charlotte suffered extreme turbulence on its way to Wilmington," said a representative. "The pilot flew back to Charlotte."
Undeterred, Minnelli ordered a taxi on Uber, paying $200 (Â£130) for the trip.
According to the star's representative, Scott Gorenstein, the driver turned out to be former Egyptian Olympic handball player Ahmed El-Awady, who competed at the 1992 and 1996 summer Olympics.
He drove Minnelli and two assistants over 200 miles through the night, delivering them to a hotel early on Saturday morning.
Later that night, Minnelli played to a sold-out crowd of 1,500 with the North Carolina Symphony.
The concert was a black tie gala to mark the opening of the Humanities and Fine Arts Center at Wilmington's Cape Fear Community College.
Minelli, the daughter of Judy Garland, is one of only 16 performers ever to earn an EGOT - winning an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Award.
Last month, she cancelled two concerts in London and Sheffield, apparently after a dispute with the promoter.
