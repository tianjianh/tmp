Gregory Rivolet, 31, spent four hours looking around the site and said about 100 cars, which he thought dated back to the 1970s, were 19m underground.
Mr Rivolet, an "urban explorer", has not disclosed the exact location of the mine, which is in Gwynedd.
He said: "There was something so surreal about this exploration... and then you see the most unexpected thing, a mountain of old cars."
The IT engineer added: "The road is pretty dangerous in this area, especially when wet. It was probably too expensive to tow cars up and out into the nearest town.
"It was very dangerous as the mine is really unstable. Pieces of slate were falling from above our heads."
He said the mine opened in the 1830s and closed in about 1960.
