[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Kent v Leicestershire ends in draw at Canterbury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Division Two match between Kent and Leicestershire at Canterbury ended in a draw after days three and four were both washed out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a combination of rain and bad light had prevented any play on day three, an early lunch was taken on the fourth day after further rainfall.
Umpires Paul Pollard and Alex Wharf called the match off at 13:00 BST with no realistic prospect of play.
The result means Kent have drawn five of their opening seven matches.
Leicestershire have drawn four of their first six games, and have not won since the opening round of fixtures.
