The 20-year-old scored 10 goals in 23 appearances for Boro after joining the Ryman League Premier Division side in November 2015.
Okenabirhie has previously had spells on the books at Arsenal and Stevenage.
"Fejiri was brought to my attention while I was at Luton. He can also play wide, he's quick and strong," Daggers boss John Still told the club website.
Dagenham dropped back into non-league after finishing 23rd in League Two in 2015-16, ending their nine-year stay in the Football League.
