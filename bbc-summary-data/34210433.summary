Crews were honoured for their work when one carriage of The Smiler ride collided with another on 2 June.
The carriages were eight metres up and the rescue took four and a half hours.
Daniel Thorpe, 27, who suffered a punctured lung and broken leg said: "Their presence was a huge comfort during a traumatic time."
Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service crews from Leek, Stafford, Sandyford, Cheadle, Ipstones, Longton and Hanley received a Chief Fire Officer's certificate of commendation.
It is given to people who have placed their lives at reasonable risk whilst saving others or whose actions have saved lives.
Leah Washington, 18 from Barnsley, whose leg was amputated after the crash, said: "The crews have been amazing, they were really caring at the time and also visited me in hospital afterwards which was lovely of them."
She added: "They really deserve the award."
Mr Thorpe from Buxton and Ms Washington were joined at the ceremony by her boyfriend Joe Pugh, 18, also from Barnsley, and 20-year-old Vicky Balch from Leyland, Lancashire, who also had to have her leg amputated.
Chief Fire Officer Peter Dartford said: "The crews that dealt with the incident at Alton Towers did an absolutely amazing job in incredibly challenging circumstances."
He added: "I am extremely proud of the professionalism and sensitivity that our firefighters showed throughout the entire rescue operation and in the aftermath the incident."
Cheadle firefighter Helen Green, who was part of the rescue operation, said: "It is a real honour and it has been lovely to see the casualties again and to know that they are all doing so well."
