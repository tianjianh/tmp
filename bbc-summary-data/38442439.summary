The summer signing from Lorient could miss as many as five matches for the Premier League side should Gabon reach the final.
Ndong, 22, is a regular for Gabon but failed to turn up for international duty in November before a World Cup qualifier. He later apologised.
Gabon are hosting the tournament, which starts on 14 January.
Bruno Ecuele Manga of Cardiff City had also been named in their squad.

The games Ndong might miss are Sunderland's home FA Cup third-round tie against Burnley on 7 January and Premier League matches against Stoke, West Brom, Tottenham and Crystal Palace.
