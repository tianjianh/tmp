Irish police set for industrial action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The organisation which represents An Garda Síochána (Irish police) has voted to take industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Garda Representative Association said the action includes "a unilateral withdrawal of services" on 4, 11, 18 and 25 November.
The Republic's Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said she was disappointed by the news.
It follows the rejection of pay proposals negotiated with the Department of Justice last week.
The decision was taken at a meeting in Tullamore, County Offaly, to discuss proposals aimed at resolving their dispute over pay and conditions.
The Garda Commissioner has issued a statement encouraging all groups to remain engaged with the talks process on Garda pay and conditions.
Nóirín O'Sullivan said the best outcome for all, including the public, would be for these issues to be resolved within the process.
The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice Frances Fitzgerald said: "Resolution of any outstanding issues of concern to the GRA can only be addressed through engagement between the parties and my Department continues to be available to discuss those issues.
"It would be most unfortunate if, rather than engaging further, action were to be contemplated that would not be in the best interests of our communities or An Garda Síochána."
Assistant Garda Commissioner Jack Nolan said the idea of gardaí (Irish police officers) withdrawing services for four days was unprecedented and urged those involved to continue to negotiate a suitable solution.
GRA General Secretary Pat Ennis said the organisation wanted pay restored and conditions addressed immediately.
Speaking with Irish broadcaster RTÉ, he said the GRA was exhausted from negotiations that have proved "fruitless".
Mr Ennis said the "organs of the State" had failed GRA members, compelling them to take industrial action.
"It's a momentous day. It's unprecedented, but that's what our conference decided on today," he said.
"It's not a choice that was taken easily.
"We are a vocational group of people and it was with great reluctance that this decision was made today, but we felt that we had no option to achieve a successful outcome to our negotiations."
Mr Ennis said that if strike action was taken, emergency services would still be operational.
He said it was not a "blue flu" - where gardaí would call in sick - but a withdrawal of services.
Such action could leave individual gardaí and those members in charge of the Garda Representative Association open to both criminal and disciplinary proceedings.
It is an offence under the Garda Síochána Act for any person to induce or do anything to induce a Garda to withhold his or her services, or commit a breach of discipline.
A person guilty of such an offence faces a fine of up to €3,000 and/or up to a year in prison if convicted in the District Court, and a fine of up to €50,000 and/or up to five years in prison if convicted in the Circuit Court.
It is also a breach of discipline for any Garda to do anything that obstructs the operation or implementation of official policy, directions or instructions.
The GRA does not have trade union status and therefore its members, gardaí, do not have the protection of the law to withdraw their services.
They are excluded from the protections under the Industrial Relations Acts that exist for other persons engaged in Industrial action.
Yesterday, a GRA ballot of their 10,500 rank-and-file members revealed that over 95% were prepared to take industrial action.
Meanwhile, the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors has announced it will hold a special delegate conference on 17 October in Athlone to discuss proposed industrial action.
The rejected proposals between the GRA and the Department of Justice included a restoration of rent allowance for new recruits to the force and the reinstatement of increments backdated to 1 July.
It is also promised that promotion opportunities for gardaí would increase on a pro-rata basis as the force expands to reach a strength of 15,000 as committed to by the Government.
The rent allowance would be restored in two phases, the first 50% on 1 January 2017 and the second 50% from 1 January 2018.
Gardaí would be required to work an extra 15 hours per year but that could be done in 15-minute blocks.
