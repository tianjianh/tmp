Is this the craziest own goal ever?!

You won't believe this own goal that was scored in the Swiss lower league!

Adrien Gulfo, wearing red, who plays for the Swiss side Pully Football, tried to clear the ball away from his goal with a spectacular bicycle kick.
Unfortunately for him it all went very wrong - watch the video.....
There was a happy ending to the story for Gulfo though, Pully went through to the cup final on penalties after the match finished 3-3
