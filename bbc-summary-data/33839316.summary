Yvette Cooper wants care worker wage rise

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Care workers should have a higher minimum wage, the Labour leadership contender Yvette Cooper says.

She has also criticised plans by Chancellor George Osborne to introduce what he called a "living wage", saying the proposals did not go far enough.
Mr Osborne pledged to lift the minimum wage from the current hourly rate of £6.50 to £7.20 from next April, gradually rising to £9 by 2020.
The other leader candidates are Jeremy Corbyn, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham.
At the general election, Labour pledged to lift the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2020.
But Ms Cooper said the chancellor's figures should be higher and in line with those put forward by the Living Wage Foundation, which currently recommends £7.85 an hour, and £9.15 in London.
She said the rise should be rolled out first to social care workers, and that it could be paid for by closing tax loopholes for large firms and hedge funds.
For adults aged 21 and over the national minimum wage of £6.50 an hour, but for those aged 18 to 20 it is £5.13.
