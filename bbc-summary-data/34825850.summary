Starting the third day on 140-2, the Black Caps were 419 runs behind after David Warner hit 253 for the hosts.
Taylor almost matched the Aussie's tally, hitting an unbeaten 235 as his side reached 510-6, 49 runs behind.
Kane Williamson scored 166 - his fourth century this year - and shared a third-wicket partnership of 265 with Taylor.
The pair took their side to 352 before Australia finally made a breakthrough, with Josh Hazlewood snaring Williamson, caught by Mitchell Johnson at mid-on.
Following Williamson's departure, Brendon McCullum contributed 27 runs to an 80-run partnership with Taylor before being bowled by Mitchell Marsh.
BJ Watling (one) and Doug Bracewell (12) also came and went as Australia responded in the evening session, but Taylor remained unmoved, passing his previous best Test score of 217 and reaching 5,000 Test runs in the process.
Australia, who lead the three-match series 1-0, look set to be without batsman Usman Khawaja for the final Test in Adelaide after he injured a hamstring.
