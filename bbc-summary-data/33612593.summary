The Eagles have been a part-time club since losing their Super League status in 2000 following an unsuccessful merger with Huddersfield.
Sheffield have secured a top-four finish in this season's Championship and could win promotion to Super League via the Super 8s qualifiers.
"It is very exciting times," director of rugby Mark Aston said.
He told the club website: "We hope that this now will give us the grounding to take this club back into Super League one day.
"We will officially start as a full-time club in November 2015. We have got a lot of work ahead to make sure that come February 2016, when we kick off the next campaign, we are fully functional and ready to go."
