Now they are taking part in a special smelly project!
The pandas are having their poo collected and investigated by the Royal Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh as part of a project to understand more about the animals' eating habits.
Researchers from Edinburgh Zoo and the Royal Botanic Gardens are also collecting poo from pandas around the world.
They want to extract DNA from the poo, and try to trace the different foods pandas eat.
This research will give zoos around the world better information on the best things to feed pandas, and could even help to breed new pandas!
It's a smelly business but someone's gotta do it.
Watch Jenny's report above!
