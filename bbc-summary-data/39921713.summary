Dumfries town centre vision competition comes to a close

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A competition to find designs to help revitalise the historic centre of Dumfries has drawn to a close.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Entrants were invited to submit their ideas for the Midsteeple Quarter in the heart of the town.
The national competition hopes to develop a new architectural vision for the area and a number of empty shops nearby.
It was organised by the community-led Stove Network in collaboration with the Glasgow Institute of Architects.
Prizes will be awarded for the top three designs in the competition and their work will be exhibited in Dumfries and Glasgow during the summer.
The Stove Network wants to see more buildings brought under local control and create new housing and services on the town's High Street.
