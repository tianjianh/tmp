Middlesbrough charged by FA for allegedly failing to control players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough have been charged with failing to control their players in Sunday's Premier League match against Manchester City at the Riverside.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Football Association charge relates to an incident around the 66th minute of the 2-2 draw when City were awarded a penalty.
The club "failed to ensure that its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion", the FA allege.
Middlesbrough have until 18:00 BST on 5 May to respond to the charge.
Referee Kevin Friend awarded City a penalty for Marten de Roon's challenge on Leroy Sane.
Boro players were furious at the decision, with De Roon and Fabio booked for dissent.
