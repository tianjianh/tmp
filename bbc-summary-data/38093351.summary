England recall second row George Kruis to face Argentina

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens second row George Kruis will start for England against Argentina as coach Eddie Jones makes four changes for Saturday's match at Twickenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kruis had ankle surgery less than a month ago but will replace the suspended Joe Launchbury in the third leg of England's autumn series.
Flanker Tom Wood, full-back Mike Brown and winger Jonny May all return after missing last week's win over Fiji.
May replaces Semesa Rokoduguni, man-of-the-match against Fiji.
Elliot Daly gets another start on the left wing, rather than his normal position of centre, while Teimana Harrison is named among the replacements in place of Nathan Hughes, who has a leg injury.
England have already beaten South Africa and Fiji in the autumn series, taking their record under Jones to 11 wins and no defeats.
"This game against Argentina is a big step up for us as they were probably the second best team in the Rugby Championship and played some exceptional rugby," Jones said.
"They are a quality team, have power in the forwards, speed and guile in the backs as well as great experience.
"We appreciate they have threats across the field and they have always been a physical, tough side. They still have their set-piece armoury in the scrum and line-outs so we're looking forward to a great game of rugby against them."
England team to face Argentina:
Brown; May, Joseph, Farrell, Daly; Ford, Youngs; Vunipola, Hartley (capt), Cole, Lawes, Kruis, Robshaw, Wood, Vunipola.
Replacements: George, Marler, Sinckler, Ewels, Harrison, Care, Te'o, Slade.
