Presenter Bill Turnbull has made the move and has been joined by Susanna Reid following the departure of former co-host Sian Williams.
Deputy editor Adam Bullimore, who is overseeing the launch, said viewers may see "subtle differences" over time.
"But we're not making a northern Breakfast, we're just making Breakfast," he said.
"The BBC has a job to report UK-wide and there's a commitment to bringing programmes and news from all parts of the UK, and Breakfast is part of that plan," he said.
"The tone of voice might change a bit. But it's keeping the fundamental ingredients the same. The things that have made the programme so successful in recent years will still be there."
Reid welcomed viewers to the show - which has a new red sofa and a new backdrop - at the start of Tuesday's broadcast.
Referring to a story about whether people knew their neighbours, she said: "Talking of making new friends, we are very glad you have joined us for our first morning from our new studio in Salford."
Viewers gave a mixed reaction to the new set on Twitter while some complained about the camera framing.
"Really not liking the new BBC Breakfast set - insipid waiting room backdrop. What next - lift music?" wrote Yarnsmith
.
While Helen Reed
 said: "Thank God I don't have a HD TV, presenters far too close and intrusive for my living room at breakfast time."
Craig said
: "I'm not enjoying the new 'colourful' look or the tight shots of Bill and Suzanne. If I want Daybreak I'll press 3."
But Vicky Watson
 said: "Really like the new #BBCBreakfast studio, very colourful", while Sam Ard
 wrote: "It's @bbcbreakfast 's first broadcast from Salford, Manchester today. New studio looks kind of 80's American, I like!"
Kit Bradshaw
 tweeted: "Enjoyed the new-look @BBCBreakfast from Salford's @MediaCityUK today! Nice cheery start to the day."
Breakfast is being broadcast from the MediaCityUK complex, which is also home to Match of the Day, Newsround, Football Focus, Blue Peter and 5 live.
Turnbull and Reid have been joined by Louise Minchin and Charlie Stayt on the presenting team.
Sian Williams will rejoin Radio 4 for a revamped Saturday Live programme, as well as presenting BBC One bulletins and Olympics coverage.
The studio guests for the first show included actress Connie Fisher, who is appearing in the musical Wonderful Town at the nearby Lowry Theatre.
US 'horse whisperer' Buck Brannaman, Manchester-based human rights lawyer Pete Weatherby QC and Dr David Holmes, a psychologist at Manchester Metropolitan University, also appeared.
Speaking before the launch, Adam Bullimore said he hoped the show would attract the same calibre of star guests as it did in London.
"We've had some researchers booking guests in advance of the move and the indications are that we will get talent on the sofa," he said.
