Shinty: Camanachd Cup wins for Oban Camanachd and Newtonmore

Beauly will be the only representatives of the lower leagues in the semi-final draw at BBC Scotland's Pacific Quay on Monday 11 July.
This follows a heroic 1-1 draw away to in-form Kinlochshiel in which Beauly held a lead for more than half the game.
Lochaber also came close to creating an upset when they forced Kyles to come from behind twice to earn a 2-2 draw at Tighnabruich.
Camanachd Cup rules require drawn games to be replayed.
Meanwhile, at The Eilan, Newtonmore cruised to a 4-0 lead over Skye who then struck back with two late goals.
Kilmallie showed little regard for Oban Camanachd's Premiership status and went ahead three times in the first half through Liam MacDonald, Brian MacKay and Duncan Rodger only to be pulled back on each occasion by MacCuish. Connor Howe then got Camanachd's winner just after the hour.
Marc MacLachlan opened for Beauly after just three minutes and it was 11 minutes into the second half before John MacRae struck for Shiel to take the tie to a replay at Braeview.
Ben Delaney got Lochaber's opener and Dunky Kerr Kyles' first equaliser just before half time. Neil MacDonald shot Lochaber ahead again and Grant Irvine secured Kyles' second bite at the cherry at Spean Bridge.
An Evan Menzies double in the first half and one each from Norman Campbell and Iain Robinson in the second had Newtonmore on easy street. Jordan Murchison struck back with two in the last six minutes but by then it was too late for Skye.
In the Marine Harvest National Division a goal in each half from Alan MacDonald helped Inveraray to a 4-1 victory on Bute which extended their lead to four points.
The new second-placers in the five horse race for this title are Glasgow Mid Argyll who have three games in hand. This followed a 12-0 rout at Ballachulish where Gary Luke with a hat-trick headed a list of seven different scorers.
