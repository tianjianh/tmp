The report added: "The quality of the resources, furnishings and environment must continue to be upgraded, kept clean, safe and organised."

"We remain committed to working with this service to ensure it meets the standards we require, but if we do not see further evidence of significant, urgent improvement, we will not hesitate to take further action."
