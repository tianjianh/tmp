But perhaps it should be Ray Westbrook.
The Great Britain and Portsmouth Amputee FC player scored a contender for goal of the season in the FA People's Cup at the weekend, helping his side reach the finals.

However, the 34-year-old roofer played down his big moment, claiming it was not a "super goal" and that many other amputee players have hit better strikes.
With no name on his shirt and only a solitary BBC camera in place, Westbrook's strike went viral only as 'Pompey Amputees'.
"The video has had over 500,000 hits online so you can imagine how much my phone has been ringing," Westbrook told BBC Sport after his side's 4-2 win over Wandgas in the regional final.
"It's been going off every couple of minutes. And the hits are still going up.
"I've scored better goals than that, though. It wasn't a super goal for me.
"I've watched it back a few times. I was just in the moment. A lot of players can score goals better than that but it's not filmed a lot. The game has a lot more skill than people would think."
Westbrook was 14 when a tackle on his ankle triggered a cancerous growth and he was forced to have his left leg amputated below the knee.
He continued to play mainstream football until the age of 25, before discovering the amputee game and setting up a club in Portsmouth.
Westbrook says he is happy with the exposure the goal has received.
"It feels good," he said. "I've done quite a lot to promote the Portsmouth Amputees.
"Every time we play a tournament the lads are really buzzing for it. We want to get as many amputees playing as possible, to build our squad and other teams around the country."
The semi-finals of the FA People's Cup saw more than 400 teams take part across nine categories, at eight venues, with the top sides progressing to finals day on Sunday, 20 March in Sheffield.
