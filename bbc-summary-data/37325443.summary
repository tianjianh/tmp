[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 2-2 Carlisle United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Armand Gnanduillet scored the equaliser as Blackpool came from two goals down to snatch a draw against Carlisle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gnanduillet struck the base of a post for the Seasiders with a close-range header after 10 minutes before Jack Payne's 25-yard strike was superbly tipped over by Mark Gillespie.
Carlisle goalkeeper Gillespie was instrumental on the stroke of half-time, saving first from Kyle Vassell before denying Tom Aldred at point-blank range.
Despite their first-half dominance, the hosts were behind after 51 minutes as Jabo Ibehre's deflected 25-yard shot was tipped against the bar by Sam Slocombe but the rebound fell to Charlie Wyke who tapped home from two yards.
Carlisle, who hold the division's only unbeaten record, doubled their advantage seven minutes later when Michael Raynes rose highest to nod home Nicky Adams' free-kick.
Blackpool pulled one back straight from the restart as Gnanduillet teed up strike-partner Vassell who nodded past Gillespie from four yards.
Forward Gnanduillet then ensured his side a share of the spoils, latching on to a ball over the top and brushing aside defender Raynes before firing past the onrushing Gillespie 16 minutes from time.
