One Direction perform at the Millennium Stadium and the Manic Street Preachers are at Cardiff Castle on Friday 5 June.
A planned 24-hour strike by the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union over pay will end at 17:00 BST that day.
Network Rail said it is working on "contingency plans", but a strike will "severely affect" services.
An Arriva Trains Wales spokesman said the company "sincerely regrets" that Network Rail staff, who operate tracks and infrastructure, plan to strike.
He said if the strike goes ahead, services will be "severely impacted" and urged concert goers to monitor its website for information and consider alternative transport methods.
