Ex-Manchester United goalkeeper Mark Bosnich has avoided a conviction for knocking a cyclist off his bike.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 43-year-old was instead given a 12-month good behaviour bond, a form of probation, for hitting and injuring a cyclist with his car in Sydney.
Australian Bosnich, who also played for Aston Villa and Chelsea, returned to a Sydney court for sentencing on Tuesday.
Magistrate Michael Price said Bosnich had good character and the offence was at the "lower end of culpability".
Bosnich described the incident as "an error of judgment" on his way out of court, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
His lawyer asked magistrates not to impose a conviction and police prosecutors did not oppose the request.
According to court documents from the initial trial, Bosnich wound down his window and told the cyclist: "Champion, you gotta pull a little to the left, you can't keep to the middle of the road."
The cyclist, 38, then struck the side of Bosnich's vehicle with an object, causing a rear view mirror to fall out of its housing, according to court documents.
Police reports said Bosnich turned towards the cyclist, striking the rear wheel which caused the victim to fall off.
The cyclist was taken to hospital with minor injuries to his ribs and elbow.
