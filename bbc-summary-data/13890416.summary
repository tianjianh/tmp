Two months later he succeeded former president Armando Guebuza as party leader, representing a change in guard in Frelimo which has dominated politics in Mozambique since it won independence from Portugal in 1975.
During his election campaign, Mr Nyusi pledged to transform Mozambique, one of Africa's poorest nations. He now presides over a country on the cusp of tapping newly discovered offshore gas fields, set to transform Mozambique's economy.
