Bid to raise £1m for new Loch Ness lifeboat station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The RNLI hopes to raise £1m to pay for a lifeboat station to be built on the shores of Loch Ness.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since the introduction of the lifeboat in 2008, its volunteers have been using a building the size of a small garage near Drumndrochit.
Loch Ness RNLI is Scotland's only inland lifeboat service and took over coverage of the loch from the Maritime and Coastguard Service.
The volunteers use an Atlantic 75 rigid inflatable lifeboat.
They work out of what is known as an Observe class station, which are stations in locations that are difficult to reach.
