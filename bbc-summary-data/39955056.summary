[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship side Bristol City have released right-back Mark Little, but veteran forward Aaron Wilbraham has been offered an extended deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Wolves trainee Little, 28, had been with the Ashton Gate club since signing on a free transfer from Peterborough in June 2014.
Wilbraham, 37, also arrived in 2014 and has scored 30 league goals since then.
The club captain's new offer also includes some "additional non-playing responsibilities".
Meanwhile, 20-year-old midfielder Joe Morrell has joined six other young players in being offered extensions by head coach Lee Johnson.
But the on-loan quartet of Wales duo Adam Matthews and David Cotterill, goalkeeper Fabian Giefer and Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham - who was the Robins' top scorer this term - have all returned to their parent clubs.
Johnson's side finished 17th in the Championship in 2016-17, three points above the relegation zone.
