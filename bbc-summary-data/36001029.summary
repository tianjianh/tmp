Bethan Rhys Roberts hosts Ask the Leader on BBC One Wales at 19:00 BST on Friday.
Carwyn Jones is a former barrister and Bridgend councillor who was elected to the assembly in 1999 and has been a Cabinet minister since 2000.
He is front and centre of an almost presidential election campaign by Welsh Labour, focusing on his six-and-a-half-year record in charge as first minister.
Opinion polls suggest the public rate Mr Jones more highly than his rivals, although the Conservatives are trying to drag him down by association with Labour's left-wing UK leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Former First Minister Rhodri Morgan paid tribute to Carwyn Jones as "the ideal person to have during a crisis", citing his handling of the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak while he was agriculture minister.
Labour sees the present steel crisis as giving Mr Jones an opportunity to portray himself as a national leader, standing up to the forces of global capitalism and a Tory government at Westminster.
But the opposition script says that if voters are not happy with the state of public services in Wales, they should blame the party which has been running the country for nearly 20 years.
