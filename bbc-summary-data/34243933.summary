The US star has called off an event at the London Palladium on 20 September, when she was to have been interviewed on stage by Sir Bruce Forsyth.
Minnelli was also booked to give a similar talk at Sheffield City Hall on 22 September.
According to reports, the events were cancelled due to a dispute over money with their promoter, Rocco Buonvino.
The promoter has previously organised celebrity appearances in the UK by Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta and others.
"We have been advised by the promoters of An Evening with Liza Minnelli that the performance has been cancelled," the London Palladium said in a statement. "All tickets will be refunded."
Rocco Buonvino Productions and Minnelli's representatives have not responded to a request for a comment.
Minnelli, the daughter of Hollywood legend Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli, won an Academy Award for her role in 1972 film Cabaret.
She is one of a handful of stars to have won the so-called Egot - an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony.
In March, the 69-year-old was admitted to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation unit for treatment of substance abuse.
In promotional material issued when the shows were announced, Minnelli said she considered the UK to be "a second home".
