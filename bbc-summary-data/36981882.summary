Lawrie's fellow Scots Craig Lee, Marc Warren and Richie Ramsay also won in the first round in East Lothian.
However, home favourites Scott Jamieson, David Drysdale and Stephen Gallacher bowed out.
Gallacher, who lost 7&6 to Italian teenager Renato Paratore, was making his return from a hand injury.
Fitzpatrick, 21, beat Ryder Cup vice-captain Thomas Bjorn 4&3 while Wood was 4&3 over Australian Matt Ford.
Lawrie beat Dane Lucas Bjerregaard 4&2 while Lee, Warren and Ramsay overcame Raphael Jacquelin, David Howell, and David Howell, respectively.
Alex Noren beat Jamieson 5&4 and Michael Hoey won 4&3 as he knocked out Drysdale.
A strong wind warning for Scotland's east coast on Saturday has forced a change to the match schedule for the weekend.
Sixteen ties will now take place on Friday morning with eight matches now scheduled for Friday afternoon.
On Saturday, both the quarter-finals and semi-finals will take place with the final being played on Sunday afternoon, when the winds are expected to ease.
