They were leading after Saturday's races but had a fight to stay top of the leaderboard on Sunday after a poor start in race four and two penalties in races five and six.
But other results went their way and BAR won with 76 points, two ahead of defending champions Oracle Team USA.
Four-time Olympic champion Sir Ben said: "It was pretty tough and we were relieved to get back on top of Oracle."
The BAR team included Rio-bound Finn world champion Giles Scott, whom Sir Ben praised for his tactics.
The Louis Vuitton America's Cup World Series is the first stage of competition in the 2017 America's Cup, with the next round of racing being held in New York in May.
The World Series will also visit Chicago, Portsmouth and Toulon this year, with a possible sixth event in Tokyo as it continues its bid to bring state-of-the-art sailing to a wider international audience.
