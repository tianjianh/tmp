[SN]TITLE[SN]

A dual carriageway will be named in honour of British service personnel killed in combat, with more than 90% of people surveyed in favour of the idea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The A453, which runs from Nottingham into Leicestershire, is set to fully reopen this year.
It bears the same number as that of the total of British military losses in Afghanistan.
The favoured name is Remembrance Way, honouring those killed in all conflicts.
The idea was suggested by the family of Warrant Officer Sean Upton, a Nottinghamshire soldier killed by an explosion while on patrol in 2009 in Afghanistan after first hearing about it on BBC Radio Nottingham.
It was put out to two-week consultation with 1,630 responses. The leading suggestions were Heroes' Way, 453 Remembrance Way, Bastion Way, Hope Way and Helmand Way. Heroes' Way was the overwhelming favourite.
Councillor Richard Butler, cabinet member for sustainability at Rushcliffe Borough Council, said: "We do have to be very careful we get it right; the last thing we want to do is cause offence.
"[The preferred option] is Remembrance Way... because of course that will have memories for other people from other wars and conflicts."
