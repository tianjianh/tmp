[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The shop and office fitting firm, Havelock Europa, has announced its chief executive, Eric Prescott, is to step down sometime this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a profit warning from the Fife-based company, issued last year, after a number of shops and financial sector customers deferred orders.
However, Havelock said a number of its divisions were seeing improvement.
In healthcare it said it had won its first two significant orders, which will be supplied mostly during 2015.
The firm which is headquartered in Dalgety Bay said in retail it was "developing new customer relationships from which we expect to benefit during the coming year".
And as expected it said education activity was "beginning to show signs of recovery" with an order book of Â£25m compared with Â£14m last year.
Last May, Havelock Europa announced the resignation of its group finance director. It said the search for a new chief executive was beginning.
