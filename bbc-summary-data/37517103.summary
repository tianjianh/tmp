[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich gate crush death: Workman guilty of safety breach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A workman has been found guilty of breaching safety rules after a woman was crushed under a heavy metal gate he had fitted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jill Lunn, 56, died after suffering a heart attack while pinned under the automatic gate in 2013.
Robert Churchyard, 51, of Turner Road, Norwich, was found guilty at Norwich Crown Court of breaching a general duty of care in his work.
The jury failed to reach a decision on a gross negligence manslaughter charge.
Mr Lunn worked for an automated door and gate company.
The case was adjourned until 17 October when a decision will be made on whether to hold a retrial or to move to sentencing for the duty of care offence.

Mr Churchyard, who denied both charges, fitted the gate, which weighed about a third of a tonne, at Mrs Lunn's home in Blofield Heath near Norwich in March 2013.
It fell on her the following month when she tried to close it by hand after the remote-controlled automatic mechanism failed.
Norwich Crown Court heard the gate was designed to be operated both automatically and manually, but fell because safety-stop devices had not been fitted.
