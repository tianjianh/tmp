Bell Bridge collapses into River Caldew

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A historical stone bridge in Cumbria has collapsed more than six weeks after it was damaged during Storm Desmond.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bell Bridge, near Sebergham, was closed after cracks were found in the wake of flooding which devastated the region in early December.
The Grade II-listed single-track stone structure dates back to the 18th Century, and was used by walkers on the Cumbrian Way.
Following heavy rain on Tuesday it has now collapsed into the River Caldew.
