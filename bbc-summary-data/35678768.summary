Hardik Pandya took 3-8 as Pakistan were skittled for 83 in 17.3 overs - their third lowest ever Twenty20 total.
India were reeling at 8-3, but Virat Kohli scored a match-winning 49 off 51 balls as they reached their target with 27 balls remaining.
They will meet again in the ICC World Twenty20 in Dharamsala on 19 March.
Pakistan lost wickets at regular intervals with wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed's defiant 25 one of only two scores in double figures.
In reply, Mohammad Amir claimed Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane for ducks then Suresh Raina for just a single in an explosive opening spell.
Kohli steadied the ship, putting on 68 with Yuvraj Singh (14 not out) before skipper MS Dhoni sealed victory with a four.
