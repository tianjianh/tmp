The 19-year-old midfielder joined Town in 2014 from Shelbourne and made his first-team debut against Doncaster in the League Cup in August 2015.
The Republic of Ireland Under-19 man played his first Championship game on the final day of 2015-16 against Derby.
"I couldn't have had a better end to the season than playing against Derby," he told the club website.
"This season it will be about more than just making the bench but to get more playing time. I'm still only 19 but I feel I'm good enough to be in the first team so I'm looking to play more this year."
McDonnell's contract follows news earlier in July that Town youngsters James Blanchfield, George Fowler, Jacob Marsden, Monty Patterson, Shane McLoughlin and Chris Smith all penned one-year deals, with the option of a further 12 month stay.
