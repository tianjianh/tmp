Shane Lay, 42, was walking his dog in Bridge Street, Bungay, at 01:40 BST on Friday when he was hit by a Nissan Qashqai.
He was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital and died on Saturday night.
Suffolk Police said they are still seeking the driver and released CCTV images of Mr Lay, of Loddon Street, Broome. His dog was unhurt.
Insp David Giles said they had received a number of calls but wanted the driver to come forward.
"We are following up on information provided to date and are working to identify the person who was behind the wheel at the time of the collision.
"It is in their interests to come forward as soon as possible."
Officers are also keen to speak to anyone with details about a Qashqai that may have sustained front-end damage or anyone aware of such a car being driven in Bungay at the time.
