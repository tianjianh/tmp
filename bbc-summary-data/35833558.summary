The separate incidents happened during the early hours of Sunday in the city's Hardgate and Fonthill areas.
Police Scotland said officers were reviewing CCTV footage in an effort to trace the man, who was thought to be aged 20 to 30.
The attacks happened at about 02:50 as the women walked from the city centre.
Det Sgt Mike Reynolds, who is leading the investigation, has appealed for witnesses.
He said: "We have conducted a number of enquiries, including viewing a significant number of hours of CCTV footage from the city centre and surrounding areas.
"As a result, I believe the same male may be responsible for both incidents. He is dressed in a black coloured Puffa-style jacket, black lower clothing and footwear, and was wearing a black beanie hat.
"He is aged between 20 and 30 years, is of a slim build and is approximately 5ft 10 tall."
