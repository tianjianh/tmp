Americans James Hahn and Ryan Moore share the lead on six under.
England's Justin Rose is three under, while Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy is level despite posting a triple-bogey seven on the 12th - his third hole.
World number one Jason Day said he will continue playing after learning his wife was involved in a car accident.
The Australian wrote on Twitter: "After the completion of my round, I was informed my wife Ellie our children Dash and Lucy and friend Katie were involved in a traffic incident near our RV.
"Their car was hit by a bus and Ellie was taken to the hospital for precautionary measures."
Casey, 39, had eight birdies and three bogeys en route to his 66 and is tied for third with America's Brian Stuard, Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas and Fabian Gomez of Argentina.
Casey told pgatour.com he was "feeling good about the game".
He added: "I must admit the way I struck the ball today was reminiscent of how I used to strike it a few years ago."
The Championship is the second of the four that make up the season-ending FedEx Cup.
The tournament features the top 100 players in the world. The top 70 after this weekend will progress to next week's BMW Championship, where the field will be whittled down to 30 for the Tour Championship on 22-25 September.
