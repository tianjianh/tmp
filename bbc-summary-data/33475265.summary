The top 40 countdown has become part of DJ Greg James' show on BBC Radio 1 every Friday, having been on a Sunday for the past 28 years.
The number one song in the revamped singles chart was David Zowie's club anthem House Every Weekend.
Ed Sheeran's X has gone to the top spot in the albums chart after being discounted at the start of the week.
The move from Sunday to Friday has come after the music industry decided to release all albums and singles on Fridays worldwide.
But the time devoted to the top 40 on Radio 1 has been cut to one hour and 45 minutes, compared with the previous three hours.
The new chart show will "reflect" the whole top 40 - but will focus on the top 20, according to BBC Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper.
Speaking when the changes were announced in March, he said: "The Official Chart Show is currently three hours but if you look at audience figures and you look at where the peaks are in terms of audience listening, you know that obviously the top 20 is more important than the top 40."
The station is launching The Number 1 Show, which will be on air from 18:00-19:00 on Sundays, and will feature the top songs from a range of charts such as the top streamed tracks, rock tracks and music videos.
The move to co-ordinate global releases means singles and albums will be be released on Fridays in 45 countries. Music was previously released on Mondays in the UK but on Tuesdays in the US and Fridays in Australia.
Electro-pop band Years and Years were among the first to take advantage of the simultaneous release day, putting out their debut album Communion on Friday.
They did a midnight show and signing session at HMV in London to mark the release, and will fly to the US to promote the album on Jimmy Fallon's NBC chat show next week.
Their single Shine entered the new chart at number two.
The group's synth player Emre Turkmen said the simultaneous global release was a good thing. "It just makes sense at this point where everyone's so connected all over the globe," he said.
"We've got fans in Mexico and Australia and Europe so it makes sense that the timing of the release date is the same for everyone."
Gennaro Castaldo, a spokesman for the BPI, which represents British record labels, said: "In this global digital world, music isn't released in isolation depending on which country you're in any more.
"If you're a Taylor Swift fan and you're in the UK, you're very conscious that she might be releasing tracks in America before you're getting them in the UK. This has caused a great deal of frustration among fans in recent years.
"Quite a bit of research was carried out and the thing that came back consistently from fans was that they want new music ready for the weekend."
The charts will not become less relevant as a result, he said. "They still are important to a lot of music fans.
"You could argue that Friday is a better day because the listening audience will be bigger and broader as well.
"You could have a lot of people at work listening to Radio 1 and a broader age range as well, which could help reconnect people with the chart and new music."
