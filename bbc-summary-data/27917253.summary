In the most recent accident, nine people are missing. On Wednesday, 10 people were killed and 25 went missing when an overloaded boat capsized.
All of the rescued passengers from the first boat were arrested under immigration laws.
Both of the boats were carrying Indonesians heading back to their home country for the Ramadan fasting month.
Malaysian maritime agency official Mohammad Zuhri said that the second boat, which sank on Thursday morning, capsized in waters off Sepang town on the outskirts of Malaysia's capital city Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Zuhri said 18 people, including four women, were rescued by passing merchant ships.
Officials said the boat was also believed to have been headed towards Indonesia's Sumatra island.
Malaysian authorities earlier said that they were investigating why the first boat sank.
The wooden vessel sank about midnight (16:00 Tuesday) off Port Klang, near Banting in the Strait of Malacca.
Survivors said the boat was leaking, which could mean it was hit by an object.
"Rough seas are making our rescue operation difficult but we will continue the search," said Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency official Mohamad Hambali Yaakup.
He said the boat sank not far from shore and raised hopes that the missing passengers could have swum to safety.
Another maritime official said said more sea vessels and divers were deployed in the search on Thursday.
Thousands of Indonesians work illegally in plantations and other industries in Malaysia. They often risk dangerous sea journeys to return home.
