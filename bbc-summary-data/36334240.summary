[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who fatally stabbed a customer in a Poundland store has pleaded guilty to manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trevor Joyce, 36, of Franklyn Close, Abingdon, attacked Justin Skrebowski with a knife from the store in the town in Oxfordshire on 7 December.
The 61-year-old had been buying balloons for his wife's birthday.
Joyce was charged with murder, but admitted the lesser charge on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
He also pleaded guilty to two counts of making threats to kill, one count of causing actual bodily harm and one count of making threats with offensive weapons.
Mr Skrebowski's wife, Gulsen Alkan, said: "The killing of Justin has left me and my two children with a devastating emotional burden and a daunting financial future which I now have to deal with alone".
Thames Valley Police said Mr Skrebowski was fatally injured in a "completely random and unprovoked attack".
Det Insp Stuart Blaik said: "[Mr Skrebowski was] an innocent member of the public, which is all the more difficult to comprehend."
Joyce was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey in London on 6 June.
