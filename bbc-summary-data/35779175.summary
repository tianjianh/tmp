[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dan Lydiate says he is not concerned about his tackling style for Wales' Six Nations match with England on Saturday.

The 28-year-old Ospreys flanker has built a reputation for his ankle-high 'chop tackle' but was recently shown a yellow card for not using his arms.
He was also penalised in Wales' 19-10 win over France and says he has been honing his technique.
"It's something that I work on in training, making sure I pay special attention to using my arms," he said.
"If I'm using my hands then it's the most I can do.
"But if it's something that's not working then you've got to change up your game almost. But as long as you're using your arm then it's legal so I make sure I wrap my arms."
Lydiate will make his 55th appearance for Wales when they run out against England at Twickenham.
England are one point clear of Wales at the top of the table with three wins from three games.
Warren Gatland's team won 28-25 against England in last year's World Cup and are aiming to record back-to-back wins at Twickenham for the first time since 1978.
Lydiate played in the 2012 Grand Slam and the 2013 Championship win, and says the team are in a positive mood.
"We take confidence from our performances in this competition," he said.
"We felt disappointed coming away from Ireland with a draw, but we haven't lost any and neither have England, so we're looking forward to the challenge.
"It would be nice to score a few more tries.
"In the second half against France, our defence stepped up a gear and got back to where we sort of saw ourselves at the World Cup.
"England are just starting to hit their stride and I'm sure they'll up it again at the weekend."
