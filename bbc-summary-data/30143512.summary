Call of Duty has made more than $10bn (Â£6.1bn) since it was launched in 2003, according to publishers Activistion,

The company claims the series has earned more than major film franchises Hunger Games, Transformers and Avengers combined.
Activision also claims Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was the biggest entertainment launch of 2014.
"We poured our hearts into making Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare an epic ride," said Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision Publishing.
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was one of the most highly anticipated games of 2014.
Activistion claims the game made more money in its first week of sales than any film, music or book launch during the year.
To put this amount of money into perspective, it's the amount some nations spend on their entire real-world defences for a year.
The figure of Â£6.1bn is almost as much as the Netherlands' annual defence budget.
At least, according to figures published by the European Defence Agency earlier this year, which looked back at how much the nation spent in 2012/2013. It was just over â‚¬8bn, which works out at just over $10bn.
"Advanced Warfare is the biggest entertainment launch of 2014 in terms of revenue, surpassing all movie, music and book launches this year." said Bobby Kotick, CEO of Activision Blizzard.
Gamers might not be surprised to learn the latest instalment of the first-person shooter has also become the highest-selling digital launch in console history.
Activision made this claim based on data from XBox Live, Playstation Network and the publisher's own estimates.
Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare went on sale on 4 November and is set in 2054, allowing players to use futuristic weapons.
The game features Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey, playing Jonathan Irons, trying to restore order to the world.
