Police said the 23-year-old was accused of running on to the pitch during Sunday's fixture at Pittodrie and faced a breach of the peace charge.
He is expected to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court next month.
Aberdeen won the match 2-1 thanks to a late free-kick scored by James Maddison, in the team's first meeting since January 2012.
