The slide, set up in Shore Road, Swanage, for the Swanage Carnival, came loose at about 13:40 BST.
Police said nine children were treated at the scene - at least one was taken to hospital.
South Western Ambulance Service said its paramedics treated three of the children but there was "nothing to suggest their injuries are serious".
There have been conflicting reports about the number of casualties but some children may have been treated by the carnival's own medical staff, an ambulance spokeswoman said.
Dorset Police said the children treated at the scene had either "stayed to enjoy the afternoon or gone home". It said one child was taken to Poole Hospital and three had been taken to the minor injuries unit in Swanage.
"Officers remain at the scene and are speaking with organisers," a spokeswoman said.
A South Western Ambulance Service spokeswoman said two of the children it treated "were reported to be suffering from neck pain" and were taken to Poole Hospital. The third was treated at the scene.
Dorset and Somerset Air Ambulance said it attended but was stood down before it landed.
