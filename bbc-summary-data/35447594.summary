McGeehan scored his 10th of the season with a half-volley that looped over debutant keeper Ryan Allsop.
The hosts, who drop to 10th, had the ball in the net after the break, but Paris Cowan-Hall's header was disallowed for a push on the keeper.
Paul Benson hit the post late on for Luton as they held out for the win.

"It's just a lack of goals for me, we dominated the first 35 minutes. I thought we were outstanding. We have got to stick them in, somebody has got to step up and say 'I'm going to start scoring for Wycombe Wanderers'.
"With no money it is really tough to get players in, I haven't got a penny to spare, we will have to get players out before we get any more players in.
"I cannot fault the efforts of the players today - it's just sticking it in the opponents' net, and we will be working on that."
Luton boss Nathan Jones told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"I was really thrilled with the contribution from the Luton fans, they filled the away end and sang all the way through. We gave them a performance they can be proud of.
"I'm so, so proud of them today - what a shift, what a graft, I'm really proud of my team. Today we showed a different side to us - in the second half, we were outstanding."
