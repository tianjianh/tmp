An Irish paralympic athlete whose prosthetic running blade was stolen has been given a replacement so he can continue with his sports career.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shane McLaughlin's carbon fibre blade was stolen from a vehicle at his home in Clones, County Monaghan, a week ago.
He told Irish broadcaster RTÃ‰ that the National Rehabilitation Hospital and the Ability Matters company had paid for an "expensive" replacement blade.
He is due to take part in a competition in Germany next week.
The Berlin Open, an international paralympic competition, begins on 19 June.
The 42-year-old athlete is an experienced shot put and discus thrower.
His leg was amputated below the knee in 2012.
Mr McLaughlin said he has not given up hope of recovering his original running blade and appealed to whoever stole it to give it back.
