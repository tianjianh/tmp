[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A virus has forced Katherine Jenkins to pull out of a concert in north Wales next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The mezzo soprano was due to perform at Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod and is said to be "absolutely gutted" after taking medical advice.
She said it was an opportunity to perform her "dream role" of Carmen and was "devastated" at the timing.
American mezzo soprano Kate Aldrich has been lined up to replace her.
The concert version of Bizet's opera will be performed at the festival's opening night â€ªon Tuesday, 5 July.
Festival chairman Dr Rhys Davies said: "I have real sympathy for Katherine because I know how much this role meant to her. We are really sorry about this but Katherine is unable to perform Carmen.
"On the other hand, we have been unbelievably lucky to be able to sign up a truly world class opera singer in her place."
