[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old, who has played two One-Day Internationals for England, was hurt while batting in the nets and has subsequently undergone a "minor procedure to repair the damage".
The news is another blow for his team ahead of the new county season.
Jade Dernbach, Freddie van den Bergh and all-rounder Zafar Ansari have also recently been sidelined.
Van den Bergh and Ansari have been recovering from thumb injuries.
Dernbach, meanwhile, sustained a stress fracture in his back during the winter and hopes to return to action later in the season.
