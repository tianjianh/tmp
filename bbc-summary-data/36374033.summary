The 36-year-old made 32 appearances for the Bees in 2015-16 after joining from Cambridge United last summer.
"I think that the club just wants to keep progressing," the centre-back told the club website.
"We want to improve on last year, get more points and see where it takes us. Personally I think there is more to come from me next season too."
