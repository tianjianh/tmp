Peaty, a City of Derby swimmer from Uttoxeter, smashed his own world record at Rio 2016 to take gold in the men's 100m breaststroke.
He won by more than a second and a half, taking the first Olympic gold for a British man in the pool in 28 years.
Clarke, a member of Stafford and Stone Canoe Club, produced a stunning final run to take gold in the kayak K1 at Rio.
At this year's Paralympic Games, Pearson added gold from the individual freestyle grade Ib and silver in dressage to his golds in Beijing and London.
Also honoured are Drayton Manor Park chief executive Colin Bryan who has been made OBE.
Colin Bryan, who runs the park near Tamworth, was recognised for his charity work and contribution to tourism.
He said: "I feel very honoured to receive this OBE. I still love watching our guests have fun, enjoying themselves, knowing I have played a part in that."
Victim Support volunteer Peter Cave, 91, from Newcastle-under-Lyme was also appointed OBE.
"His contribution has empowered victims to being to move on from their experiences as well as helping justice to be done and to be seen to be done," his citation said.
