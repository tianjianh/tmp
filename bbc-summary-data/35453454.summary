Di Luisa's corner threw in the towel at London's Copper Box as Groves dominated in his first outing since September's WBC world title loss to Badou Jack.
The super-middleweight, who has a new trainer in Shane McGuigan, now has a record of 22 wins from 25 fights.
"I'm going to make a couple of mistakes," said Groves, 27. "I felt really sharp."
Groves is trying to rebuild a career that also includes two world title defeats at the hands of fellow Briton Carl Froch.
