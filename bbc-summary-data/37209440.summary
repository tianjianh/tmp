Beryl Larkin wins 20-year Treuddyn caravan planning battle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has won a 20-year battle to continue living in her "little piece of heaven" in Flintshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Beryl Larkin, 72, appealed to the Welsh Government after Flintshire council rejected her application to remain in her caravan on land at Treuddyn near Mold.
A planning inspector has now granted her lifetime consent.
Plans to bulldoze the caravan were called off last year when Mrs Larkin was taken ill.
Mrs Larkin has twice been prosecuted for failing to comply with enforcement notices and has had several failed planning bids, the latest being in May 2015.
The retired nurse, who is recovering from surgery, said she could not believe the good news.
"I woke at 3am and wondered if it had really happened," she said.
"It is a shame that this decision could not have been made in the first place.
"I like my little house. It's my little bit of heaven and I am looking forward to getting back on my feet and doing all my little jobs."
Mrs Larkin's daughter Helen, said she was "absolutely delighted" with the outcome.
"This gives her peace of mind now that she can live there for her lifetime," she said.
