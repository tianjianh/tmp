[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradley Dredge will play in his first US Open after finishing joint fifth in the qualifying event at Walton Heath.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joint leader after a first round 62 on Sunday, the Welshman slipped down the leader board with a second-round 71.
Fellow Welshman David Boote missed out on one of the 15 qualifying places in a seven-way play-off.
The amateur also fired a 62 in the first round, but two bogeys on the back nine on Monday saw him slip from the automatic qualifying places.
Writing on his own website, Dredge said: "Not only was one of two players who shot a club record 10 under par 62 around the [Walton Heath] new course but I also made sure I would complete the major grand slam, having previously only played The Masters, The Open and The USPGA."
The qualifying event was won by Wolverhampton's Aaron Rai, with Andrew "Beef" Johnston also among the qualifiers for the 117th US Open at Erin Hills, Wisconsin, from June 12-18.
Qualifiers: Aaron Rai (Eng) -14; Haotong Li (China) -13; Alexander Levy (Fra) -12; Richie Ramsey (Sco) -12; Oliver Bekker (S Africa) -11; Joel Stalter (Fra) -11; Bradley Dredge (Wal) -11; Eddie Pepperell (Eng) -11; Brandon Stone (S Africa) -10; George Coetzee (S Africa) -10; Andrew Johnston (Eng) -10; Paul Dunne (ROI) -9; Matt Wallace (Eng) -9; Thomas Aiken (S Africa) -9; Wade Ormsby (Aus) -9.
