Offshore catering workers have accepted a fresh pay offer, averting industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of Unite had voted in favour of a strike in October.
However that was postponed last month when the Caterers Offshore Trade Association (Cota) made the fresh offer.
A consultative ballot ran until noon on Friday, with a recommendation to accept. Unite members in Cota accepted the improved pay offer by 63% to 37%.
Unite regional officer John Boland said: "Although deeply frustrated at the length of time it has taken to get to this point we are pleased the Cota employers recognised our members' justifiable concerns and finally pursued a resolution through proper negotiations."
Cota chairman Peter Bruce said: "It is great news for employees and for the industry that union members have voted decisively to accept this offer.
"We believe it is a fair deal for employees, protecting their earnings while helping our businesses through this tough economic climate.
"Now that this dispute has been settled we can focus on working together to meet the issues our industry is facing in the year ahead."
