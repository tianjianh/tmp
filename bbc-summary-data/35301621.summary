[SN]TITLE[SN]
Christmas Day confession abuser Michael Sweeney jailed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted sexually abusing three boys after he was recorded apologising to one victim on Christmas Day has been jailed for 28 months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Sweeney, 60, pleaded guilty to charges of lewd and libidinous conduct towards the boys between 1972 and 1978 at a house in Paisley, Renfrewshire.
He was caught after one victim, now aged 48, confronted and recorded him at his home on 25 December 2014.
The recording was handed to police who traced the other victims.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Turnbull told Sweeney that he had no other option but to send him to prison.
Making reference to remarks made by Sweeney's lawyer, about how his client was immature at the time of the offences, Lord Turnbull said: "I take into account what has been said on your behalf about how you have been a law abiding individual who has lived a socially useful life.
"I also take into account that you haven't offended since these offences took place more than 40 years ago.
"However, the sexual abuse of children is a most serious offence and the only sentence available to this court is one of imprisonment."
The court heard that the man who recorded the conversation was just four when the abuse began.
Sweeney attacked the boy up to 30 times while babysitting him at the child's family home in Paisley.
Sweeney also attacked two other boys - who were then aged about seven and 11 and were friends of the first victim - when they came to visit him.
The court heard Sweeney would give the three boys sweets after each ordeal.
As a teenager, the first victim wrote about what had happened to him in a diary.
He later gave it to his father to read but it is believed no formal complaint was made at that time.
The two other victims who were abused - now also in their late 40s - never fully revealed what happened until they were contacted by police.
