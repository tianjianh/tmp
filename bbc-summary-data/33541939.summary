West Side Story actress Rita Moreno, the Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa and Broadway star Cicely Tyson will also be recognised at a ceremony on 6 December.
President Barack Obama will host the event at the John F Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington.
The honours recognise the lifetime contributions of performing artists.
"The Kennedy Center Honors recognises the extraordinary and unparalleled talents of individuals whose impact and genius have left an indelible mark on civilisation," said Kennedy Center chairman David M Rubenstein.
He went on to pay tribute to "the quintessential American rock and roll sound" of The Eagles, King's "heartfelt lyrics and tunes" and Lucas's "stories of epic adventure".
Moreno's "iconic spitfire roles", Ozawa's "artistic leadership" and Tyson's "strong female roles on stage and screen" were also cited in the official awards announcement.
The honourees will receive multi-coloured medallions at a presentation on 5 December, ahead of a gala evening that will be recorded for broadcast on the CBS network on 29 December.
