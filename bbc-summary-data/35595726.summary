The 28-year-old, who returned in January after more than a year out with a knee injury, has made more than 250 appearances for Forest.
"Since I first started playing football I always wanted to stay at a club for 10 years," he told Forest's website.
Winger Oliver Burke, 18, has also extended his stay, signing a new four-and-a-half-year deal.
Academy product Burke has made 13 appearances this season, scoring two goals.
