[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Before this trip Theresa May promised to be frank with the American president when she disagreed.

But when pressed for an answer on Donald Trump's controversial refugee ban she first of all, uncomfortably, avoided the question.
Then on the third time of asking she would only say that on the United States policy on refugees it was for the US.
Her refusal to comment was immediately condemned by the former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, who said it was shocking and wrong. The UN has expressed dismay and France and Germany have reported concerns.
Downing Street had been delighted with its visit to Washington. But the PM returns to a row over her refusal to give her view.
Having boasted that the virtue of the special relationship is that friends can be candid with each other, Theresa May's silence on President Trump's executive order will raise suspicion that in fact, as the junior partner, she is unwilling to speak her mind.
