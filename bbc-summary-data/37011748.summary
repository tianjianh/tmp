The still shows a man wearing a jacket with a distinctive "V" on it, in an off-licence near the bus stop where the murder took place hours later.
Despite previous Met Police appeals the man has never been identified.
Stephen, 18, was murdered by a group of six white youths in an unprovoked attack, in Eltham, south-east London.
Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of his murder and sentenced to minimum terms of 15 years and two months and 14 years and three months in January 2012.
The investigation into Mr Lawrence's death remains open.
The Met said the potential witness was in an off-licence on Well Hall Road in Eltham at 20:00 BST on 22 April.
The off-licence was 330 yards (300m) from the bus stop where Mr Lawrence was attacked two and a half hours later.
Witnesses saw a man in the "V" emblem jacket near Well Hall Road roundabout at about the time Mr Lawrence was attacked, the Met said.
Det Ch Insp Chris Le Pere, said he hoped the man would come forward to help police with inquiries, or to "eliminate this strand of the investigation".
The image of the jacket was previously circulated to media in 1993 and again in 2013.
The CCTV was "recently identified as part of a regular internal review of the case", he said, and released as a public appeal after being digitally enhanced.
Mr Le Pere said: "We are hoping that over the passage of time allegiances may have changed, people may have moved away and feel more confident coming forward."
