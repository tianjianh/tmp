[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torino 2-2 Lazio

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goalkeeper Joe Hart was beaten twice but Torino scored in injury time to grab a point against Lazio in Serie A.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England international, on a season-long loan from Manchester City, could do little about either goal.
Hart was beaten by Ciro Immobile's acrobatic volley, which cancelled out Iago Falque's opener for the hosts.
The 29-year-old conceded again when the unmarked Alessandro Murgia headed in from a corner but Adem Ljajic equalised from the penalty spot in added time.
