No activity at Lewis-based Hebridean Sea Salt

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sea salt business appears to be no longer in business following the launch of an investigation into the authenticity of its product.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC reported in February that Lewis-based Hebridean Sea Salt was the subject of a probe by local authority environmental health officers.
It has now emerged that its product is no longer stocked by a supermarket and cannot be bought online.
There is no activity at its factory or on its social media sites.
The BBC has been unable to contact the owner Natalie Crayton for comment.
The probe by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's environmental health department is understood to have been prompted by concerns raised by a former employee.
Hebridean Sea Salt was formed six years ago and became a well-known brand in delis and shops across the country.
It began as a small operation before successfully securing orders from high street stores such as Sainsburys, which had been offering the product at its 360 stores in a deal worth Â£180,000.
Hebridean Sea Salt had also been making inroads into international markets.
The company has had financial backing from the public purse with Highlands and Islands Enterprise contributing Â£174,573 to expand the business.
