Volunteers sought for Scottish bat survey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Volunteers are being sought for a Scotland-wide survey of bats.

The Bat Conservation Trust is asking people to note sightings at sunset and before sunrise in an effort to gauge the health of bat populations.
The surveys involve spending an hour looking and listening for bats and entering the results online.
Anne Youngman, Scottish officer for the trust, suggested volunteers could incorporate their surveys into a "romantic sunset saunter".
The UK is home to 18 species, including brown long-eared, common pipistrelle and Daubenton's bats.
The nationwide survey will run until the end of August.
Ms Youngman said: "This survey is ideal for you if you don't have previous bat surveying experience.
"It is also a perfect opportunity to get together with family and friends and discover bats and other wildlife in your local area.
"Simply head out at dusk or before dawn, or both. Spend an hour in your garden or walking around your local area and look out for bats."
She added: "You can enjoy a romantic sunset saunter, or a mini adventure before dawn."
