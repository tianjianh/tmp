[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Seager put the hosts ahead with his first goal for the club but Leroy Fer headed in Jay Fulton's cross to equalise two minutes later.
Another Fer header made it 2-1 on the hour before Tammy Abraham netted his first Swansea goal from close range.
With four minutes of normal time left, Jordan Ayew scored with a tremendous 20-yard effort to wrap up the win.
There was bad news for Swansea however, as defender Kyle Bartley was taken off on a stretcher after an awkward landing late in the game.
Swans boss Paul Clement said: "I thought we made hard work of it. I think we had enough control of the game and the threat that we caused, we should have put it to bed in the first half.
"But we went a goal behind through a mistake, but we got back into the game.
"I wasn't particularly happy at half time and I let the players know that. We've got to be more clinical and more ruthless, but we had good control of the game and I was pleased with the end result."
