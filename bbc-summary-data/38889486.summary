[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 0-2 Southend United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Powerful second-half headers from Marc-Antoine Fortune and substitute Theo Robinson gave Southend United victory at in-form Oxford to boost their League One play-off hopes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxford had won their previous five games in all competitions but they struggled to break through against a dogged Shrimpers defence.
Just after the hour mark - after a pacy overlap on the right - Jason Demetriou delivered a perfect cross for Fortune to head powerfully home.
And with just two minutes remaining, Robinson smartly peeled away from the goal-line to head in Luke O'Neill's right-wing corner.
Oxford were not at their best and their better opportunities came in the first half.
Chris Maguire fired an angled 20-yard free-kick into the side netting.
And from a Maguire corner, centre-half Chey Dunkley was unlucky to see his thumping header come back off the inside of the post.
Dunkley had another header saved at a corner after the break, but Southend were always threatening in the second half and sealed maximum points.
