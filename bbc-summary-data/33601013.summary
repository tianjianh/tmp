Seagulls: Denis O'Donovan calls for cull of 'vicious' birds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Irish politician has claimed that "vicious" seagulls are posing a danger to society and has asked the Irish parliament to consider a cull.

Senator Denis O'Donovan said the seabirds had "actually killed lambs, they've killed rabbits" and were "invading towns and villages".
His remarks echoed those of his Fianna FÃ¡il party colleague Ned O'Sullivan.
In July 2014, Mr O'Sullivan told the Irish senate (Seanad) that seagulls had "lost the run of themselves" in Dublin.
Mr O'Sullivan said at the time that although the issue might sound funny, it was a serious problem in the city, because the birds were threatening to attack children in an attempt to steal food.
In the Seanad on Monday, Mr O'Donovan said "it's coming to the stage where they're actually endangering society".
"Their behaviour is coming to the stage, to be realistic now, it's like a rabbit with myxomatosis or a cow with mad cow disease."
Mr O'Donovan called on his Seanad colleagues to hold a debate on a possible cull in the autumn.
The Fianna FÃ¡il senator added that "no less a person than prime minister of Great Britain, our neighbours - David Cameron - has come out publicly to record his concern and his worry about the way seagulls are behaving".
He was referring to an interview Mr Cameron gave to BBC Radio Cornwall at the weekend, when the prime minister was asked about seagull attacks on a pet tortoise and a pet dog in the area.
Mr Cameron said the issue was a "dangerous one for the prime minister to dive in" to, but called for a "big conversation" before any decision was made on a cull.
