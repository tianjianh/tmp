Following back-to-back league postponements, January signings Antonio German and Aidan Nesbitt are still waiting to make their debuts.
St Johnstone defender Brian Easton misses out again with a gashed foot but will resume training later this week.
New signing Plamen Krachunov could feature if international clearance arrives in time.
The Bulgarian provides cover for skipper Dave Mackay, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a hip problem.
Saints' planned visit to Firhill on Boxing Day was postponed after torrential rain and Thistle have been idle over the last two weekends after call-offs.
Those cancellations leave the hosts with four games in hand on their nearest rivals in the bottom half of the table.
"The players are desperate for a game," said manager Alan Archibald.
"There's a bit of pressure on us, we've got to take something from our games in hand.
"St Johnstone are a difficult proposition but we're the home side and we need to make sure we play at a good tempo."
Saturday's 2-1 win over Motherwell at McDiarmid Park was Saints' first three points since 5 December and lifted them up to fifth in the Premiership.
"It was nice to get the win," said manager Tommy Wright.
"It got us back into the top six and now this is one of the games in hand that we have got so we have to try to make the most of it and pick up more points.
"We are not taking anything for granted, it is one win and we have to try to build on it."
Thistle were 2-1 winners in Perth in October, while they triumphed 3-0 on St Johnstone's last visit to Firhill in March.
