Former Fulham manager Kit Symons believes the club could face another difficult season in the Championship.

Fulham sacked Symons last November and finished 20th under his eventual successor Slavisa Jokanovic.
"I'd love the club to do well, but I think it's a tough time," Symons told BBC Radio London.
"The Championship is unforgiving and is really tough, and I think with the teams that have come up and down it's going to be even tougher next season."
Symons, 45, made 129 appearances for Fulham during a three-and-a-half-year spell as a player at Craven Cottage.
He later returned to the club as a coach and was put in charge of the first team in October 2014 following the departure of Felix Magath.
"I've got a lot of history with Fulham, having been part of two promotions and stuff I did with the Under-18s and Under-21s, and then I felt I did a good job with the first team," he said.
"I hope they are very successful. It's a brilliant club and the Fulham fans deserve that."
