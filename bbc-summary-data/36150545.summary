The 22-year-old has made 32 appearances since joining the U's from Crystal Palace on an 18-month deal in January 2015, after a loan the previous season.
Wynter missed three months of this season after a clash of heads with team-mate Tom Eastman against Tottenham in the FA Cup on 30 January.
He returned on Saturday against Burton, when Colchester were relegated.
"I'm pleased that I've signed a new deal, it gives me a bit of stability and allows me to concentrate fully on playing football," he told the club website.
"It's been a frustrating season for me personally but hopefully, that's all behind me now."
The length of his new contract has not been disclosed.
