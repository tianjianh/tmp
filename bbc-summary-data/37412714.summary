NHS Tayside said they were  being treated within a dedicated area of Ninewells Hospital in Dundee.
Some of the children are confirmed to have the infection while others are suspected cases.
The health board said patient confidentiality meant it was unable to disclose the total number of cases.
The Angus outbreak has affected children in Carnoustie and is centred on a primary school and a playgroup in town.
NHS Tayside said possible sources and routes of transmission were still being investigated - including a possible link with a national outbreak in which a three-year-old girl from Dunbartonshire died and 21 other people have been infected.
Consultant in public health medicine Dr Jackie Hyland said: "This is an evolving situation. Members of the community are understandably concerned and have provided tremendous support in trying to minimise spread of infection and identify a possible source.
"The cases and contacts have now been identified and children should now be attending school or nursery unless they are symptomatic or have been formally excluded by the Health Protection Team.
"We are working very closely with our partners Angus Council, the local school and playgroup, to ensure everything has been done to prevent the spread of infection. This has included additional cleaning at those premises."
She said an Incident Management Team has been working hard to identify all those who might be at risk and ensure they received appropriate medical treatment and advice. clinicians.
"The community should be reassured that the risk to the general public remains low," she added.
The national E. coli investigation, led by Health Protection Scotland, has said cheese produced by South Lanarkshire-based Errington Cheese Ltd is the most likely source of the outbreak.
Errington has disputed that evidence and insisted that its products are safe to eat.
