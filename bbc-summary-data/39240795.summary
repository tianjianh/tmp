[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plymouth maintained their League Two automatic promotion push with a win over Morecambe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Carey rewarded early Plymouth pressure with another superb goal for the hosts.
Oscar Threlkeld attacked down the left before teeing up playmaker Carey, who curled his effort home from 20 yards.
Shrimps goalkeeper Barry Roche had a busy first half, saving well from Jake Jervis and Gary Miller.
The visitors' best effort came from former Argyle forward Lee Molyneux, who swept a 25-yard shot just wide of goal in the 33rd minute.
A minute later Threlkeld looped a header just over Roche's crossbar as Plymouth continued to press.
Morecambe made a better start to the second half but it was Argyle who went close again through Carey.
Jervis should have doubled Plymouth's advantage but was unable to take his chance.
