Gillingham 2-1 Bury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Jackson was an unlikely match-winner as Gillingham went top of League One with a 2-1 victory over Bury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The right-back gave the Gills a first-half lead, before his dangerous cross was turned into his own net by Bury captain Antony Kay in the second period, with Tom Pope pulling one back in vain.
The opener came in the fifth minute after Mark Byrne's chipped through-ball found the overlapping Jackson, who took a moment to steady himself before sliding the ball under Ben Williams.
Two minutes before the break, Emmanuel Osadebe met Paul Konchesky's cross and thumped a header against the bar and a Josh Wright long-range volley drew a stunning save from Williams.
Gillingham's second came in the 57th minute when Bury skipper Kay tried to clear Jackson's low cross but skewed past his own goalkeeper.
Bury were back in it nine minutes later, though.
Tom Soares crossed for Pope to plant home a header into the bottom corner but they could not find an equaliser.
