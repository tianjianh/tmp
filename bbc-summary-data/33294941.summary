Paul Trollope: Cardiff City coach set for Wales assistant job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales are expected to appoint Cardiff City head coach Paul Trollope as their new assistant manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kit Symons is to leave manager Chris Coleman's coaching team to concentrate on his role as Fulham boss.
Trollope joined Cardiff in February and would combine his Bluebirds duties with his new role as Wales assistant on a part-time basis.
The Football Association of Wales has approached Trollope but has yet to agree a deal with Cardiff.
Former Wales midfielder Trollope, 43, previously managed Bristol Rovers and was also first-team coach at Birmingham City and Norwich City.
During five years as manager of Bristol Rovers, he guided the club to promotion to League One in 2007.
Swindon-born Trollope won nine caps for Wales between 1997 and 2003 and was a team-mate of Coleman and Symons with the national team and at Fulham.
Symons had been Chris Coleman's assistant since January 2012 and continued in the role despite succeeding Felix Magath as Fulham manager in October 2014.
But Symons, who won 37 caps at centre-back for Wales, left his international post after Wales' 1-0 victory against Belgium which has put them in a strong position to qualify for Euro 2016.
Unbeaten Wales are three points clear at the top of Group B following their 1-0 win over Belgium on 12 June, with four games remaining.
They would virtually clinch their place at next year's finals in France by beating Cyprus and Israel in their September double-header.
Wales conclude their group games away to Bosnia-Hercegovina and home to Andorra in October.
