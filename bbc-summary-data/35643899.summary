[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos prop Mitch Garbutt has apologised for his red card in Sunday's World Club Challenge defeat by North Queensland Cowboys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Garbutt, 26, was sent off in the 71st minute of his side's 38-4 loss for punching opponent James Tamou.
The Australian was banned for two games by the Rugby Football League on Monday.
"It's not something that I am about. I don't condone violence and I sought James out after the game to apologise," said Garbutt.
"I accepted the ban and I'm very disappointed I won't be out there with the boys for the next couple of weeks."
"Everyone that knows me knows I'm not the sort that does that kind of thing."
