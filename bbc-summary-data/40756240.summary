[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil Town have made defender Daniel Alfei their ninth summer signing following a successful trial period.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old, a former Wales Under-21 international, has agreed a two-year contract with the League Two club.
Released by Swansea in 2016, he most recently played for Welsh Premier League side Aberystwyth and has played four pre-season games for Yeovil.
"How Daniel has been playing non-league football for Aberystwyth Town is beyond me," said Yeovil manager Darren Way.
"It's up to him now to take this opportunity and aim for 40 league games this season."
