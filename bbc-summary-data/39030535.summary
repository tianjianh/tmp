Elite League: Dundee Stars 'should aim higher' after double over Fife Flyers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee Stars coach Marc LeFebvre has urged his team to aim for an even higher Elite League placing after they climbed into the play-off spots over the weekend.

Back-to-back victories over Fife Flyers, combined with rivals Coventry Blaze dropping points to Nottingham Panthers, mean the Tayside club are in the top eight with five weeks of the regular season to go.
And the Stars coach has his sights on keeping their Gardiner Conference hopes going when they visit Braehead Clan, who could have secured their place this week, next Saturday.
"It's been a massive week overall, starting with the Manchester game at the end of last week, and it means we've taken seven points out of eight," LeFebvre said.
"Our target was six, so we're pleased with that, plus some results have gone our way elsewhere too, so it's definitely nice to be in a play-off spot.
"But we have to keep trying to climb the ladder and going as far as we can. We're not settling for eighth and we'll see how things pan out for us.
"We're still in for the Conference as well and I was telling my players that. With some luck on our side, we'll head to Braehead looking to upset their parade."
Victory over Flyers on Saturday meant Stars leapfrogged Blaze into eighth place.
The Fifers took an early lead as Chase Schaber and Brendan Brooks struck in the opening six minutes.
By the end of the opening period, the Stars were level as Mikael Lidhammar and Felix-Antoine Poulin each scored.
Cale Tanaka put LeFebvre's side in front, but that was cancelled out by Justin Fox.  However, with two minutes left, Poulin's second secured a huge victory.
The teams met again on Sunday in Tayside and Flyers again took the lead during the first period when Schaber found the net, but Justin Faryna levelled towards the end of that opening session.
Dundee then went ahead inside the opening couple of the minutes of the second when Joey Sides finished, with a tip-in from Kevin Bruijsten opening up a two-goal gap.
Schaber picked up his second early on in the third to bring Fife to within one, but Brett Switzer's late empty-net goal made it a great weekend for the Stars.
Dundee's victories meant they moved further ahead of Edinburgh Capitals, who didn't play this weekend but are seven points adrift of the play-off places as things stand.
The results between Fife and Dundee meant the Gardiner Conference title celebrations were on ice for Clan, who needed the Flyers to win in regulation time in either of the two games.
Victory over the Stars at home on Saturday night will secure the title for the third time in a row after they took care of their own business with a comprehensive 8-5 home victory over Fife on Friday night at Braehead Arena.
Scott Pitt's early lead for the Clan was turned over by Ryan Dingle, who scored twice before Cody Carlson levelled.
Dingle completed his hat-trick to restore Flyers' lead, but Matt Keith had the game tied before Corey Cowick put Braehead in front again - all in the first period.
Stefan Della Rovere made it 5-3, with two more from Cowick opening a 7-3 gulf by the end of the second period.
Early third-session strikes from Carlo Finucci and Matt Sisca gave Fife a glimmer of hope, but Pitt's second to bookend the scoring killed the game off in Clan's favour.
