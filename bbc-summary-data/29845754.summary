The number of people injured in hit-and-run collisions in London has risen for the fourth year running, Metropolitan Police figures have shown.

A total of 4,154 people were injured in these type of collisions in 2013, up from 3,090 in 2009.
London Assembly Green Party member Jenny Jones said: "This is a worrying trend which the Met Police needs to treat as a priority."
The Met said it "treats road crime with the seriousness it deserves".
The force added it "targeted criminals who use our roads, working with partners to ensure the safety of all road users in the capital."
Figures from Scotland Yard from 2013, which were published following a request by the Green Party, showed 1,043 pedestrians and 896 cyclists were victims of hit-and-runs, when a driver fails to strop following a collision.
However, the number of fatalities and serious injuries as a result of such collisions fell compared with 2012.
The proportion of all the collisions in London which are now hit-and-runs, has gone up for the last four years and is now almost a fifth of the total.
