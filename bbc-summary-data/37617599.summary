[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Yazidi woman who was tortured and raped by Islamic State (IS) group militants has won a human rights award.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Iraqi activist Nadia Murad was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe.
Miss Murad became the face of a campaign to free the Yazidi people and stop human trafficking after escaping IS in November 2014.
The 23-year-old had been captured and enslaved three months earlier along with about 5,000 women and girls.
During her months in captivity, she was bought and sold several times, and subjected to sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the jihadists.
Miss Murad, who was named a United Nations goodwill ambassador in September, called for the creation of an international court to judge crimes committed by IS extremists in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg.
She went on to brand IS's attack on the Yazidi a "genocide", adding:  "The free world is not reacting."
The award, which honours outstanding civil society action in defence of human rights, comes with prize money of 60,000 euros (Â£54,250;$67,000).
