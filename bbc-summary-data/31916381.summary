It seems all that speculation was true.

Kanye West will headline Saturday night at this year's Glastonbury in June after all.
The festival's organiser, Emily Eavis, tweeted: "We are thrilled to let you know we have the one and only Kanye West headlining Saturday night on the Pyramid stage!"
The Foo Fighters had already been confirmed as Friday night's headliners, while the main act for the Sunday night has yet to be announced.
Tickets for Glastonbury 2015 sold out in less than 30 minutes last October.
Music fans paid Â£225 for a ticket to the festival held at Worthy Farm in Somerset.
Back in 2008, Noel Gallagher claimed it was "wrong" to have a hip-hop headliner when Jay Z performed on the Saturday.
Today's announcement seemed to have passed Kanye by at first as he spent much of it tweeting topless pictures of his wife.
The 37-year-old has since acknowledged the announcement though, claiming to be "excited".
