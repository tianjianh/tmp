Wales National Survey: People 'highly satisfied' with public services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People across Wales remain "highly satisfied" with the NHS, education and with their daily lives, according to a national survey.

It suggested 91% of people were satisfied with GP care and 92% with their last NHS hospital appointment.
Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it was "heartening" to see such high levels of satisfaction.
The survey was an "important resource" which would help "support the delivery of public services", she added.
Asked to rate services on a scale of zero to 10, the average rating for health services was 6.3 and education 6.6, with performance of the Welsh government just above the middle of the range at 5.6, all in line with previous years.
On other aspects of life, there were large majorities satisfied with their accommodation (94%), recycling services (82%) and the level of respect in their local community (79%).
Overall, the survey of more than 14,000 people found that 83% were satisfied with their daily lives.
Other less positive findings included:
There were mixed views on the performance of councils, which have been getting to grips with steep budget cuts.
People agreeing that their local authority provides high quality services fell from 57%, in both of the two previous years, to 53%.
This varied from 42% in Blaenau Gwent believing their local services were high quality to 65% in Conwy.
Across Wales, just 37% agreed that their council "does all it can to improve my local area".
Powys came off worst on this question, with just 29% agreeing with the statement, while Caerphilly got the best result, where 45% agreed.
Welcoming the overall results, Ms Hutt said: "It is particularly heartening to see such high levels of satisfaction with the NHS and education.
"The survey is an important resource for us and will support the delivery of public services.
"Hearing the views of people across the country will help us make Wales an even better place to live, work and enjoy."
No wonder the Welsh government sounds happy - after a year when their record on public services, health in particular, has been under scrutiny like never before, it seems the people who use those services have had a positive experience.
The data confirms a paradox any politician who's knocked on a voter's door will recognise - people tend to think their own experience is good, but have a perception that the overall picture is poor.
Not that anyone should run away with the idea that life in Wales is without its problems.
Forty percent of people report finding it difficult to keep up with the bills, although that figure is lower than in previous years.
And one in five say they feel "materially deprived" - going without a holiday, failing to put anything aside or feeling unable to have the heating on.
It's not all good news for the Welsh government either - although the public has rated elements of the NHS and education highly, the administration that delivers them gets only a modest score: 5.6 out of 10.
