Regional resilience to recession job losses 'mixed'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than half of Scottish local authority areas are still trying to make up jobs lost since the financial crisis, according to a report.

The Fraser of Allander Institute and Scottish Centre for Employment Research said regional resilience to the recession had been "mixed".
It found 18 of 32 council areas had lower employment now than in 2007-08.
A further five had bounced back by 2013, while the remainder had made up the lost jobs by 2016.
The report also suggested Scotland had failed to bounce back from the financial crisis as well as the UK.
It said Scotland entered the recession with a better employment rate but now lagged behind all key indicators of employment, unemployment and economic activity.
Responding to the report, the Scottish government said recent statistics showed that Scotland's labour market remained resilient.
The report suggested that Scotland's labour market had held up "relatively well" in recent months but said employment had fallen by 20,000 over the past year, largely driven by a fall in full-time work.
It also said that while unemployment had fallen by 27,000 over the past 12 months, this was due to an increase in people classified as economically inactive. The researchers suggested this was driven by a rise in the long-term sick.
Fraser of Allander Institute director Prof Graeme Roy said the sluggishness of growth in the Scottish economy was partly driven by challenges in oil and gas.
He added: "What is interesting is that, unlike the UK, Scotland has not regained the heights it reached just before the financial crisis in terms of key labour market outcomes.
"At the same time, we have long known that there have been substantial structural differences in labour market outcomes across Scotland.
"What this new analysis shows us is that there also appears to have been quite significant differences in terms of resilience to recession both in jobs lost and then jobs regained once growth returns.
"Understanding what has driven these differences and evaluating how policy at both a local and national level has either helped to narrow or widen them is crucial."
A Scottish government spokesman said Scotland was "not immune" to the increased economic uncertainty following the Brexit vote.
He said: "The recent labour market statistics show that Scotland's labour market remains resilient.
"We are working to build an economy where everyone can share in the benefits of economic growth.
"It is therefore encouraging to note this rise in the number of people in work alongside some positive statistics on female and youth employment, where we continue to lead the UK."
