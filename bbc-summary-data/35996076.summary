[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ameen Jogee to be retried after successful joint enterprise appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who won an appeal against his murder conviction in a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court on joint enterprise law is to face a retrial.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ameen Jogee, then 22, from Leicester, was jailed for his involvement of the murder of a former policeman in 2012.
The UK's highest court has ordered that Mr Jogee is retried on the charge of murder "with the included alternative of manslaughter".
The court ruled that the law had been wrongly interpreted for 30 years.
Mr Jogee and Mohammed Hirsi were given life sentences in March 2012, for the murder of Paul Fyfe, who was killed in Leicester in June 2011. Mr Jogee was to serve a minimum 20-year term.
The joint enterprise law has been used to convict people of murder - even if they did not inflict the fatal blow - in gang-related cases if defendants "could" have foreseen violent acts by their associates.
In February, the Supreme Court ruled that it was wrong to treat "foresight" as a sufficient test.
It said jurors should view it only as evidence to be taken into account, not as proof.
Mr Jogee's appeal was allowed following the court ruling and his conviction quashed.
In a statement, the court said: "It is in the public interest that the guilt or innocence of Jogee on the charge of murder, alternatively manslaughter, should be determined by a fresh jury approaching the case anew and correctly directed upon the law as it is now known to be."
The 26-year-old has been remanded in custody ahead of his retrial.
