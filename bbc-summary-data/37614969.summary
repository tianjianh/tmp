[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ipswich Town 2-0 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Captain Luke Chambers scored Ipswich's first goal in 502 minutes to help his side to victory over Burton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Freddie Sears sent in a crisp cross for Chambers to head in from close range and end his side's barren run.
Having made the first goal, Sears scored the second late on, latching on to Tom Lawrence's pinpoint pass to score for the first time in 38 matches.
Ipswich's first win in six games pushes them up to 12th in the table, three points above Burton, who drop to 18th.
Burton had rallied after going behind early on, and Lucas Akins should have levelled when he was sent clear by Chris O'Grady, but he shot wide of the near post.
Early in the second half, Ipswich almost doubled their lead but Leon Best saw his shot blocked brilliantly by Ben Turner.
Burton had a few half-chances but Sears clinched the win after a great piece of skill from Lawrence.
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy: "Whether we have played him on the right, the left or in the centre, Freddie has been selfless and never questioned it.
"His pace and energy means he is a constant threat and I have never once considered leaving him out.
"It has not been a nice couple of weeks so it was good to win 2-0 and get another clean sheet."
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough: "I think our first half was the best we have played all season, but the one thing we couldn't do is put the ball in the net.
"There was plenty to be encouraged and pleased about. I was delighted with our performance and the fact we are Burton Albion coming to Ipswich Town should be put into perspective.
"I am disappointed but I am not disheartened by our performance. We tried to be positive in the first half and that certainly worked. We created some great chances, we could just not finish them off."
