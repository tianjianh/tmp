Beddau body-in-plastic fingerprints investigated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fingerprints found on plastic used to wrap the body of a man whose remains were found in a garden are still being investigated by police, a pre-inquest hearing has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of John Sabine, who was last seen in 1997 and who would now have been 85, was found at Trem-Y-Cwm, Beddau, Rhondda Cynon Taff in November.
An earlier inquest heard he died of blunt force trauma to the head.
Mr Sabine's wife Leigh Anne, who died in 2015 aged 74, is the main suspect.
Aberdare coroner Andrew Barkley was told on Thursday that forensic work was ongoing, including looking at fingerprints found on the wrappings of the body.
Mr Barkley adjourned the hearing ahead of a full inquest on 19 May.
