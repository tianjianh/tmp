[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Wells, 78, from Leicester, abused his victim in Sheringham Court School in Norfolk.
Wells was previously handed a six-year sentence in June 2014 for indecent assault against another boy.
Police said Wells had exploited his position of trust and preyed on his victims, subjecting them to "horrendous abuse".
The victim came forward after seeing Wells convicted for the offences at Norwich Crown Court two years ago.
Wells, of Bracken Dale, Leicester, was convicted of the two sexual assaults at Ipswich Crown Court.
Wells was placed on the sex offenders register for life.
His former colleague and headmaster Bryan Greenhalgh, 65, of Suffield near North Walsham, admitted 13 counts of indecent assault and one serious sexual assault, and was given a life sentence at Norwich Crown Court.
Investigating officer Det Con Tristan Coull, of Norfolk Constabulary's Child Abuse Investigation Unit, said: "Both men exploited their positions headmaster and housefather to win over the trust of the boys in their care and subject them to horrendous abuse.
"They preyed on boys who were at their most vulnerable and who at the time of the abuse felt unable to speak out as they appeared to be upstanding pillars of the community.
"Through the positions they held, it would have been the most basic of expectations to protect these children, instead they chose to do the complete opposite."
