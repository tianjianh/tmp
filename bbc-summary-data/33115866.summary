A man with HIV has been jailed for seven years for infecting two women after having unprotected sex with them and not telling them about his condition.

One victim, known only as Miss B, said Mweetwa Muleya, 28, from Swansea, had destroyed her life.
He pleaded guilty to two counts of causing grievous bodily harm in May.
"The harm to these victims was of the worst kind," said Judge Huw Davies at Swansea Crown Court.
He told Muleya:  "You were selfish to a degree which beggars description."
The court was told Muleya, who came to the UK from Zambia in his teens, was given anti-retroviral medication to control the virus and advice on how to stop its spread.
He was told it would be a crime to have unprotected sex with someone and not disclose his HIV positive status.
But the court heard he fell into a lifestyle of drink and drugs and lapsed when it came to sexual health check-ups.
He was jailed for seven years with six months for unrelated drug offences.
