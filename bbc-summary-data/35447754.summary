[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simeon Akinola's effort was denied by Gateshead keeper Sam Russell, before Ryan Bowman came close to opening the scoring at the other end.
Head defender Craig Baxter managed to clear a goalbound in-swinging corner by Taylor Miles to keep the scores level.
The home side then nearly nicked all three points late on but Michael Cheek failed to convert Akinola's flick on.
