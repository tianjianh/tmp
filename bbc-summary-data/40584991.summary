A new Gweithdy, a sustainable building for craft making, will also be opened. Both will welcome visitors from Friday.
The redevelopment project, due to be completed in October 2018, is National Museum Wales' biggest ever.
It also marks the greatest period of change for the St Fagans open-air museum since it was founded in 1948.
The facility's existing Grade II-listed main building, originally designed by the Percy Thomas Partnership and completed in 1975, has been refurbished and public space doubled.
The old courtyard has been covered, creating an atrium with a new entrance.
Visitor facilities include:
Visitors to the Gweithdy will be encouraged to experience traditional skills first-hand.
There will be a wide range of courses and craft workshops on offer, run by skilled craftspeople and artists.
