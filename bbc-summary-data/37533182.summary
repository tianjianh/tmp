Britain's Johanna Konta banished memories of her US Open defeat by Anastasija Sevastova as she swept past the Latvian at the China Open.

Konta lost to Sevastova in New York last month but dominated in Beijing, winning 6-1 6-1 and dropping just two points on her first serve.
She goes on to face Hungary's world number 25 Timea Babos in round two.
In the men's event, Kyle Edmund beat Russia's Evgeny Donskoy 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 to qualify for the main draw.
Andy Murray is the top seed in Beijing and will open his campaign against Italy's Andreas Seppi later in the week.
Konta, seeded 11th, remains in with a chance of qualifying for the season-ending WTA Finals for the top eight players in the rankings.
She could also break into the world's top 10 for the first time, and join Virginia Wade, Sue Barker and Jo Durie as the only Britons to achieve the feat on the WTA Tour.
