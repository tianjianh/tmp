Guernsey FC manager Tony Vance says he is still deciding who should be the club's new captain.

Sam Cochrane gave up the role last month, having led the Green Lions since their formation in 2011.
Among those tipped to take over are former Portsmouth and Oxford United goalkeeper Chris Tardif and experienced defender Jamie Dodd.
"I've chatted to a couple of people and I'm going to take my time over it," Guernsey boss Vance told BBC Sport.
Cochrane stepped down from the captaincy in order to concentrate fully on his role as a player, having led the club to two promotions and an FA Vase semi-final appearance.
"We're not really a team full of out-and-out leaders," added Vance.
"I'm not talking about someone who can shout and lead in that old school manner, it's more about being able to lead on the pitch in your performance and off the pitch in the manner you go about your business.
"That's one of the key attributes of that job, so it could be a real left-field option that we look for, but we'll see.
"The important thing is that the player has the respect of everybody, has the opportunity to develop themselves further and develop the club further, and take us all with it."
