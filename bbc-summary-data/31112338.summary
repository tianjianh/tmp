Airports Commission consultation on Gatwick and Heathrow runways ends

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A commission looking at whether Gatwick or Heathrow should expand will conclude its public consultation later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Airports Commission will make a recommendation to the government about the UK's future air capacity. It is likely to be published in the summer.
It has shortlisted three options: a third runway at Heathrow, lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow or building a second runway at Gatwick.
The public consultation will end at 23:25 GMT.
The commission has already concluded there is a need for one additional runway in the South East of England by 2030.
Boris Johnson had supported the idea of an island airport in the Thames estuary - dubbed Boris Island - but the commission declared the idea would not be shortlisted.
It cited the huge price tag and environmental concerns.
