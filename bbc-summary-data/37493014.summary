Stephen Hunt, 38, from Bury, was unlawfully killed in the fire at a salon in the Northern Quarter in 2013.
His mother and stepfather insist the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service "sends out the wrong message".
An inquest jury found it was probable that two 15-year-old girls deliberately started the fire after smoking cigarettes outside the building.
After a review of the inquest's findings, Greater Manchester Police said "no further action" would be taken.
Mr Hunt's mother Susan Veevers and stepfather Wilf Veevers said they were "disappointed".
In a statement, they said: "We, as a family, have suffered this catastrophic loss, the loss of a hard working, honest, caring family man.
"And having heard the evidence and outcome of the coroner's inquest, it seems the irresponsible actions that caused the tragedy will just go unpunished.
"We firmly believe that this is sending out completely the wrong message."
The two girls were arrested after the blaze and one was charged with arson, but the charges were later dropped.
Fire Brigades Union executive council member Kevin Brown said: "We respect the decision of the CPS and police.
"We hope that lessons will be learnt from Stephen's death to make all firefighters safer across the country."
A statement from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: "Following the findings from the coroner's inquest the Crown Prosecution Service and GMP reviewed the case and it has been determined that no further action will be taken."
