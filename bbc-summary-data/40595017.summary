France international Navarrete, 23, left the Dragons for Wigan along with Morgan Escare for the 2017 season, and has made 20 league appearances.
Scotland flier Tierney, 22, has 18 tries in 37 Warriors games, and won the Super League title last season.
"They add both quality and depth," said new head coach Steve McNamara.
Dragons CEO Christophe Jouffret added : "I would like to thank the Wigan Warriors, and in particular Kris Radlinski, for their help in facilitating the negotiations.
"The loan of these two players will strengthen the links between our two clubs."
McNamara has brought in the pair to help Catalans in their likely Qualifiers campaign once the Super 8s begin in early August.
