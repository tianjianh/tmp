[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The orange detonators were found near Queens Road in Greenfield, Flintshire, on Sunday.
The 5cm (2in) round orange discs are used by rail staff to warn maintenance workers of approaching trains and give a loud bang on impact.
Police said the detonators could be "dangerous in untrained hands".
"Only two years ago a teenager from Essex sadly lost his sight after a detonator accident, so I can't emphasise the dangers enough," said PC Carl Jones, of North Wales Police.
"We are obviously concerned for the safety of the individuals who have the detonators, regardless of their age, and I would urge anyone who has information that could help us with our enquiries to contact us as soon as possible."
