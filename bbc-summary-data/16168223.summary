Omagh multi-school campus consultation begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final public consultation on a proposed multi-school campus in Omagh opens on Wednesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plan is to build new schools on the former Army base at Lisanelly.
But some schools are reluctant to agree and one school, Loreto Grammar, has taken the Department of Education to court over its failure to build new premises on its existing site.
The department said that five schools are currently interested in moving to the Lisanelly site.
The three most enthusiastic are believed to be Arvalee Special School, Omagh High School and Sacred Heart College.
The new site would include some shared areas, such as a school of performance, sports facilities and an ecology centre.
While Education Minister John O'Dowd admits the financial situation is challenging, he wants to proceed with the plans.
Mr O'Dowd will meet educationalists and young people in Omagh at an exhibition of the school campus design.
