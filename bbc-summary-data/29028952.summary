Former Stranraer ferry terminal site interest heats up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inquiry levels from developers looking at taking over Stranraer's former ferry terminal site have been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 20 have expressed an interest in the East Pier site which has been vacant since Stena Line moved its operation to Cairnryan three years ago.
Dumfries and Galloway Council and the ferry operator have worked together on a regeneration strategy for the area.
Any development is expected to include a mix of commercial, retail and residential use.
There is also the potential for a casino licence for the area, as well as a major revamp of the wider Stranraer waterfront, including expansion of the current marina.
The local authority said it had had discussions with a number of interested parties to assist them with their inquiries.
The final submission date for possible schemes has been set for the end of October.
