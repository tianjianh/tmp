[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moira Morrison was seen close to the River Dee in Garthdee on Tuesday afternoon.
A lifeboat and Coastguard teams have been involved, with police kayakers and the force helicopter also called in.
Mrs Morrison, from the Mannofield area, was wearing dark trousers, a dark jacket, white trainers, and was carrying a white carrier bag.
She is described as being about 5ft 2in tall.
Insp Steve McEwan, who is leading the inquiry, said: "A large area has already been searched both on land and water - stretching from Aberdeen Harbour up to Robert Gordon University - as we  continue to establish Moira's whereabouts.
"This is completely out of character for her and we are obviously growing increasingly concerned for her safety and wellbeing.
"I know members of the public might want to help with the search however I would respectfully ask that you allow our teams to do this given the challenging weather."
