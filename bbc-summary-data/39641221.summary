The 54-year-old, who was assistant to Terry Butcher, has joined the club for the remainder of the season.
Caley Thistle chairman Kenny Cameron said: "The board are delighted to help the manager and his back-room team in any way possible in the battle for survival in the Scottish Premiership."
His side are bottom of the table.
Foran has been assisted by Brian Rice, who was at Caley Thistle under previous manager John Hughes, since being promoted from the playing staff last summer.
The Irishman expressed his delight at the addition of Malpas to his staff.
"He is a great coach with huge experience of Scottish football and his knowledge and extra set of eyes will be invaluable for the challenges ahead," he told the club website.
Malpas, who has 55 Scotland caps and spent his playing career with Dundee United, had spells as manager with Motherwell, having started as Butcher's assistant, and Swindon Town.
However, he then returned to being Butcher's assistant with Caley Thistle, from 2009 and 2013, and Hibernian.
Malpas most recently was director of football with Raith Rovers but left that position in May 2015.
He has previously been linked with the manager's job at Caledonian Stadium.
Caley Thistle are five points behind Dundee at the foot of the Premiership with five games remaining.
