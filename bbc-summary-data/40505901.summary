[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke City have signed 18-year-old defender Josh Tymon after he left relegated Hull City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tymon opted to cancel his scholarship contract with his hometown club, despite having made 12 appearances last season.
He has signed a five-year deal with the Potters.
The Championship side will be entitled to a fee due to the England Under-20 international's age and their role in his development.
Tymon made his debut for the Tigers in the FA Cup against Bury aged 16.
Hull's vice-chairman Ehab Allam told the club website: "The club is naturally disappointed to lose a home-grown product of its academy."
