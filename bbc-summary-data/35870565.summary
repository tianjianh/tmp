Simon Francis: AFC Bournemouth training trip to Dubai 'not a holiday'

Bournemouth defender Simon Francis says people would be wrong to think their training trip to Dubai during the international break is a "holiday".

The Cherries flew out to the UAE following Sunday's 3-0 defeat at Tottenham and return on Friday.
"We want to recover, rest up and go again in training over the next couple of weeks and continue to work hard," Francis told BBC Radio Solent.
Bournemouth's next league game is home against Manchester City on 2 April.
Eddie Howe's squad made a similar trip to Dubai last season during the international period and their run to the Championship title.
"People might look at it as a breather, relaxing and not doing anything," Francis added. "But, we benefited from it hugely last season at the same stage. It got us promoted basically.
"It's a bit of team bonding and everyone getting together for a week. Training in the warm weather means you get more out of it and you come back fitter."
