Ex-Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning has been bailed after being arrested for a third time by Operation Yewtree detectives probing alleged sexual offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 72-year-old answered bail and was told he faced further claims, before being released until March.
Mr Denning was arrested for the first time in June as part of the investigation, which was prompted by abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile.
None of the claims against Mr Denning relate to the late DJ Savile.
The Metropolitan Police investigation, Operation Yewtree, has a number of strands. One is looking specifically at the actions of Savile, and the second at allegations of sexual offences against "Savile and others".
Mr Denning's arrest falls within a third strand, relating to allegations against suspects unconnected to the Savile investigation.
A statement released by police did not name Mr Denning, but said: "'Yewtree 13', aged 72, was further arrested after returning to a police station to answer bail. The arrest relates to further allegations made to Operation Yewtree.
"'Yewtree 13' was arrested on 3 June 2013 on suspicion of sexual offences and taken into police custody. He was subsequently released on bail pending further inquiries.
"On 10 September he was further arrested at an address in east London in connection with additional offences.
"He was re-bailed to return pending further inquiries. On his return today he was further arrested as above. He has now been re-bailed. Next due on a date in March.
"All allegations relate to the strand of the investigation we have termed 'others'."
Mr Denning was part of the original Radio 1 team when the BBC station was launched in 1967, and was the first announcer heard on BBC Radio 2 when the channel took to the air in 1964.
