Police received a report of an alleged assault on a child by a woman who was with him in an Asda supermarket in Liverpool on Tuesday.
Officers were called to the store in Utting Avenue, Anfield, at about 13:00 GMT.
A woman was arrested and later bailed. Police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.
Det Insp Lee Schofield said: "Thankfully the child was uninjured, but he was left distressed by the incident."
He added: "This must have been shocking to see and I believe that if you were shopping at Asda on Tuesday and witnessed this alleged assault, you would remember it."
