The centre, 25, did not take part after sustaining a leg knock on Thursday.
"He's pretty resilient. He will do the right thing by the team and by his body," assistant coach Paul Gustard told BBC 5 live.
England have until an hour before kick-off to finalise their side for Saturday's Calcutta Cup game.
If Farrell does not make it, Gustard says Ben Te'o will start at inside centre with Jonny May coming on to the bench.
"It will be a loss, of course, but we are very happy with the strengths Ben can bring," Gustard added. "We are very happy with the 23 we will have on the pitch.
"We have flexibility, Jack Nowell is there who can come into the centre. Elliot Daly can come in to 13. So we will be very happy."
Victory for England over Scotland would give the defending Six Nations champions a record-equalling 18th consecutive win and put them one win away from a second straight Grand Slam.
However, regardless of their winning run, head coach Jones was in prickly mood in Thursday's news conference.
"I can't speak for how Eddie is," Gustard said on Friday. "The staff and players are excited. We are just confident. That's not to sound bullish.
"The only record that has been spoken about is finishing on the 80-minute mark beating Scotland."
Brown; Nowell, Joseph, Farrell, Daly; Ford, Youngs; Marler, Hartley (captain), Cole, Launchbury, Lawes, Itoje, Haskell, Hughes.
Replacements: George, M Vunipola, Sinckler, Wood, B Vunipola, Care, Te'o, Watson
