A police officer was slightly injured during the 27-year-old's arrest but no members of the public were hurt.
Witnesses said the man was wearing a balaclava and running back and forth by St Aloysius College on Hill Street.
He was arrested for alleged breach of the peace and carrying two offensive weapons.
There were reports the man threatened a lollipop man and tried to attack a janitor at the Glasgow School of Art during the incident which happened at about 08:30.
Ch Insp Mark Sutherland, of Police Scotland, said: "I would like to thank the many members of the public who acted quickly to ensure the safety of others.
"Through their quick and decisive action my officers were on scene within minutes and acted immediately to ensure this incident was brought to a swift conclusion.
"From our investigations so far we do not believe that the 27-year-old man's actions were targeting any particular individual or premises in the area and a full investigation is currently ongoing to establish the full circumstances that led to today's events."
A report will be prepared for the procurator fiscal.
Privately-run St Aloysius has both primary and secondary school pupils.
A school spokeswoman said: "All pupils and staff are safe as the situation was identified and quickly defused by police.
"The safety and wellbeing of our pupils is, as always, paramount and staff have met with pupils to reassure them.
"The college, along with other local businesses and residents, are now assisting Police Scotland with their inquiries."
A Glasgow School of Art spokeswoman said: "The Glasgow School of Art can confirm that a member of our staff did encounter the individual described, whilst parking his car near to a GSA building.
"The member of staff is shaken, but unharmed."
