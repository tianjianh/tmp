Officers have warned people not to approach David Chadwick, 58, who is described as a "risk to children".
Chadwick, from Weymouth, was released from prison about a month ago but breached his licence conditions on Wednesday.
Police said he caught a train from Wareham to Brockenhurst in Hampshire and could be sleeping in outbuildings.
A spokesman said he then boarded a further train on Thursday with the intention of travelling to Norwich.
Anyone who sees him is urged to dial 999.
When last seen, he was wearing a dark Barbour-style jacket and glasses. He was also carrying A4 paperwork, believed to be an Ordnance Survey map.
Police said they had established Chadwick had got off a London-bound train at Moreton, east of Dorchester, on Wednesday at 12:40 GMT.
He is then believed to have hitched a lift to Briantspuddle from "an unsuspecting member of the public".
Det Insp Joe Williams said: "We also understand Chadwick has with him a rucksack, sleeping bag and Ordnance Survey map and so it is possible that he is sleeping in outbuildings within the area.
"We would like to reassure the public that local neighbourhood policing teams have stepped up patrols in the area and we are doing everything we can to find him."
Chadwick, who was convicted of child sex offences in 2013, is described as white, of medium build, about 5ft 10in (1.7m) tall, with short grey hair and a small scar on his left cheek.
Police said there could be "various reasons" why Chadwick had not complied with his licence conditions and appealed to him to get in touch.
