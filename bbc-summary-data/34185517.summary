Probe into 'murdered' Swansea landlord Alec Warburton continues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the murder of a Swansea landlord are still looking for his body and his lodger, who is known to have travelled to Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alec Warburton, 59, has not been seen since 31 July and was reported missing two days later.
Since then his Peugeot 205 was used to travel to north west Wales and returned to Swansea before later being found at Birkenhead ferry port, near Liverpool.
Police had previously called for lodger David Ellis, 40, to get in touch.
His last known movements are CCTV footage of him boarding a ferry to Belfast on 5 August.
Officers have searched in and around Mr Warburton's house in Vivian Road, Sketty, where they both lived, and a police tent was put up on the street.
Another lodger, Christian Evans, told BBC Radio Wales: "Alec kept himself to himself.
"He was a nice guy and we hope we can get to the bottom of this as soon as possible to give any justice that might be needed, and closure for tenants and his brother."
Friday marks one month since a murder investigation was launched.
