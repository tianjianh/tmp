Watch a WW2 bomb be blown up!

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's not often you get to see what happens when a World War Two bomb gets blown up.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police say they think it was a bomb dropped on Birmingham during the Second World War but that didn't explode at the time.
It was found on a building site.
BOMB FACTS
Don't worry though - it was a controlled explosion carried out by the police, to make it safe.
People living nearby were moved to safe areas to make sure that no one would be hurt.
The bomb disposal team said 13 lorry-loads of sand had been brought in to create an igloo or cave around the 250kg bomb before experts set it off.
Birmingham is a major industrial city and lots of tanks, guns and bullets for the war were made there.
On 19 November 1940, the German air force attacked the city very heavily.
Historians think this bomb could have been dropped that night, or on 20 November 1940, when a road nearby was destroyed by a bomb.
