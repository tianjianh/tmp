Organisers of the event said Dundee Waterfront offered a "rare blank canvas opportunity" for investors.
The V&A Museum of Design will open at the site in 2018 and Slessor Gardens, a city centre park, was opened by the Queen in July.
About 26,000 sq m of development land is available at the waterfront.
Recent investment announcements in the project include £30m by Our Enterprise for the development of flats, offices and commercial space,
Dundee City Council is also in discussion with developers over a mixed-use development, which would include flats, offices and a 130-room hotel.
Dundee Waterfront is split into five distinct zones and the project has already secured £750m of committed investment.
Mike Galloway, executive director of city development said: "We are forecasting several hundred thousand visitors to the city each year due to the new V&A Dundee.
"Add a new marina, new railway station, offices, hotels and new businesses opening, Dundee Waterfront is going to be buzzing.
"We need more investors to grasp this opportunity and partner with us on innovative design and build ideas.
"They might be surprised at how entrepreneurial we are.
"Dundee really is open for business and we are keen to encourage creative and innovative proposals from London's investment and development community".
The Dundee Waterfront briefing will be held at Pinsent Masons on Earl Street on 22 September.
