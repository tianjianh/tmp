Utoeya hosts first student camp since Norway massacre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's a tiny place - no more than a few hundred square metres of forested hillside and scattered clearings. A tranquil place of wild flowers, birdsong and lapping water.

But for the last four years, the island of Utoeya has been associated with an act of almost unfathomable cruelty.
When Anders Behring Breivik shot dead 69 mostly teenage members of the Norwegian Labour Party's youth wing, on 22 July, 2011, Utoeya took its place alongside such cities as New York, London, Madrid and Mumbai as the scene of appalling, politically motivated violence.
Now the Worker's Youth League (AUF) wants to reclaim Utoeya as a place of youthful idealism and relaxed political discourse.
As more than 1,000 young activists descend on the island, just half an hour's drive west of the capital, Oslo, the clearings are once again full of rucksacks, guitars and tents.
Next to brand-new wooden buildings where participants will discuss - among other pressing issues - how to combat extremism in Norwegian society, the haunted cafeteria where many of their former comrades died still bears the scars of Breivik's murderous rampage.
Ragnhild Kaski, 25, remembers hiding just nearby. She heard the shooting and the screams, but never actually saw Breivik.
"The memories of that day are mostly chaos," she recalls. "I don't think anyone really knew what was going on."
Now secretary general of the AUF, preparing to open the first summer camp since 2011, Kaski is reluctant to dwell on Utoeya's darkest day. She and her colleagues are relentlessly sunny about the island, the summer camp and the future.
But of course the massacre on the island still casts a long shadow.
Suspended among the trees near Utoeya's northern tip, an elegant steel ring carries the names and ages of all but eight of Breivik's victims on the island.
Some of the parents aren't quite ready. While almost everyone agrees that it's time for Utoeya and the AUF to move on, there are a few for whom the wounds are still too raw.
A recent study published in the journal Scandinavian Project found that some parents are still too traumatised to work, while two thirds are showing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.
In the first year after the killings, the AUF's determination to redevelop the island and resume summer camps caused widespread distress among the bereaved.
"They rushed it," says Asne Seierstad, author of One of Us, a book about Breivik and the massacre.
"It was dreadful. People said 'My daughter died, she bled to death on the shore. Are young people going to sunbathe there again?'"
But Seierstad says the movement learned from its early mistakes, consulting extensively with a national support group over the memorial and other plans for the island.
And she says it was always vital for the AUF to return.
"It's their island," she says. "If they hadn't reclaimed the island, who would have won? Who would have changed Norway?"
For generations of left-leaning Norwegians, the island has been a special place.
"Utoeya has always been a symbol of joy, community, solidarity, belonging to a movement," Seierstad says.
"It's always been that happy island of the Labour Party."
Today, it's happy once more. On Thursday, busloads of cheerful students lined up on the mainland for the short crossing to the island.
Catching the same ferry used by Breivik, who dressed up as a policeman to gain access.
Police officers stood nearby, keeping a low-profile watch on the students as they registered.
Out on the fjord, a police launch patrolled the water around Utoeya. Camp organisers say officers will also be present until Sunday, when the gathering ends.
The authorities regard the likelihood of another act of far-right terrorism as low, but were stung by allegations that their response in 2011 was slow and chaotic.
Norway, like many European countries, is now much more preoccupied with the possible dangers posed by would-be Islamic militants.
Jon Fitje Hoffman, director of strategic analysis for the Norwegian police (PST), says there's still plenty of far-right hatred, and even threats, circulating on the internet, but very little evidence of it on the streets.
With increased funding and new legislation, he believes the PST is better prepared than it was in 2011 to deal with violence from the far right, but he sounds a warning.
"That doesn't mean we would have discovered Breivik today," he says. "I think that's unlikely."
Breivik's shocking actions came out of the blue. The actions of one man, with no co-conspirators, who went to extraordinary lengths to go under the radar as he planned his attacks in Oslo and Utoeya.
And that, as everyone here knows, is almost impossible to prevent.
How does a country recover from mass murder?
