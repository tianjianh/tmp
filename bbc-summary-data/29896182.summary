Woman jailed over Mullany honeymoon killings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who gave false alibis to two killers who murdered a Welsh couple on their honeymoon in Antigua six years ago has been jailed for perverting the course of justice.

Catherine and Ben Mullany were shot on the Caribbean island in July 2008. Mrs Mullany was killed at the scene. Her husband died in Wales a week later.
Georgette Aaron, 37, was sentenced to six years for providing alibis for their killers Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell.
Martin is serving a life sentence.
Howell, 24, was shot dead by police in Antigua in June after escaping from prison, where he was also serving a life sentence for the murders and a four-year term for burglary.
Dr Mullany was training to be a GP and Mr Mullany was a student physiotherapist. The couple, both 31, were from Pontardawe in the Swansea Valley.
Martin and Howell, who were 20 and 17 at the time of the killings, shot the Mullanys in the head in their hotel bedroom on the last day of their honeymoon.
They were also convicted of murdering a Jamaican shopkeeper, Woneta Anderson, 43. Both were also charged with two further killings, although neither stood trial for them.
Aaron had told police she had been with her teenage lover Howell and his accomplice at the time the Mullanys were shot.
At Aaron's hearing, prosecutor Adlai Smith said her statements had been "calculated to derail an investigation into two men subsequently found to have killed five people over the course of eight weeks.
"It was a dark period in the history of Antigua and Barbuda."
He added it was quite likely the pair would have continued killing if they had not been arrested.
Defending, Ralph Francis said his client had worked for a law firm for 11 years, had been given a good community report and had a young family.
She had to wait six years for the matter to be resolved, he said, and had been "made to suffer" during that period.
Jailing Aaron on 31 October, Justice Albert Redhead said she had committed a very serious offence.
"You lied and continue to lie even at your trial that they were with you, and left with you, and you persisted in making a false alibi, knowing that the murders had been committed," he said.
He said he could not grant a non-custodial sentence as the defence requested as he would be "shirking his responsibility to society" if he did.
Following the hearing, prosecutor Mr Smith said: "We echo the sentiments of the learned trial judge, Justice Albert Redhead, that the court should take a dim view of persons trying to assist others to evade justice."
A funeral service for the Mullanys held at Cardiff's Llandaff Catherdral saw over 1,000 mourners attend, including the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, after she met the couple's parents on a flight to the Caribbean.
The duchess became patron of a charity set up in their name, the Mullany Fund, to assist those seeking to enter the health profession.
The fund continues to award an annual prize for excellence in physiotherapy to a trainee.
