The 45-year-old former Tottenham defender, who led Newport to promotion from the Conference in 2013, leaves County sixth in the League Two table.
Jimmy Dack and Wayne Hatswell have been placed in temporary charge of Newport.
Gillingham have been without a manager since Peter Taylor was sacked on New Year's Eve.
Since then a four-man caretaker team comprising Andy Hessenthaler, Steve Lovell, Darren Hare and Mark Patterson has been in charge.
"I'm looking forward to the task at hand, it's a step up for me and after watching the squad, there is development here and a fan base," said Edinburgh.
The Gills have won two of their five league games since Taylor's departure and are currently 18th in League One, seven points off the play-off places and four points above the relegation zone.
