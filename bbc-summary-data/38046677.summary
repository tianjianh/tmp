Belfast Giants' Elite League hopes suffered a blow as they were beaten 5-1 away by Sheffield Steelers on Sunday.

The Giants produced most of the early pressure but were hit by a sucker punch as Mathieu Roy put Sheffield ahead in the 11th minute.
Second-period strikes by Levi Nelson and Jessie Schultz increased Sheffield's advantage to 3-0.
Schultz and Ben O'Connor added further Steelers goals in the final period before Colin Shields' late reply.
The result was Belfast's first defeat in six games.
It meant a mixed weekend for Derrick Walser's side after Saturday's 4-3 shootout win over Dundee.
