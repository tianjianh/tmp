In pictures: London Zoo animals line up for stock take

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tigers, penguins and crocodiles have all lined up to be counted as part of London Zoo's annual stock take.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sumaratan tiger cubs were just one of the 750 species counted.
The stock take confirmed the zoo has five Sumatran tigers, of which three are cubs.
The count included 70 Humboldt penguins and one rockhopper.
Monday's count found there were 21 red-kneed spiders, including this Mexican one.
Although it is undertaken once a year, keepers have an inventory which is updated continuously.
The zoo has five llamas; four adults, one cria [baby]. There are also three alpacas.
The compulsory count is required as part of the zoo's licence.
The results - including those of the Bolivian black capped squirrel monkeys pictured above and below - are logged into the International Species Information System (ISIS) where the data is then shared with other zoos.
Last year's count found there were 16,869 animals from 758 different species.
Pictured above is a six month old Philippine crocodile, one of six that were the first of their kind to hatch in the UK.
