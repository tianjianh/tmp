Alan Bannon, 38, died alongside his colleague Jim Shears in a fire at Shirley Towers in Southampton in 2010.
Charlotte Bannon said the iPod "was priceless" to the couple's daughter Abi.
Mrs Bannon said she discovered on Thursday it had been stolen from her car parked on her drive in Bitterne.
Abi, aged 11, who was five when her dad died, listened to the blue iPod every day.
She said: "I just want it back - every day I have this time when I listen to the music and I think of him."
The device had 353 songs on it - including music from Pink Floyd, Korn, ACDC, Def Leppard and Limp Bizkit.
Mrs Bannon said: "To her this was a connection with her dad, it made him alive again. It reminded her of her hero dad.
"I have one devastated little girl who feels she's lost her daddy all over again."
Anyone who finds the iPod nano is urged to put if back though their letterbox or hand it in to The Holy Saviour church, Bitterne.
