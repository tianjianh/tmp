The 24-year-old Australian-born seamer has previously represented New South Wales and Tasmania.
He claimed the wicket of Eoin Morgan when Netherlands beat England at the 2014 World Twenty20.
"He is a bowler who has stood out for Netherlands and has the potential to forge a successful county career," said Glamorgan chief executive Hugh Morris.
Van der Gugten, who has a Dutch father, made his international debut against Afghanistan in March 2012 and played in England for the Netherlands in that year's CB40.
He played in Australian domestic cricket for New South Wales, Tasmania and Hobart Hurricanes between 2011 and 2014 and mostly recently played three games for Northern Knights in New Zealand's domestic Twenty20 competition.
Glamorgan have Jacques Rudolph contracted as their overseas player until 2017, but van der Gugten will be able to play alongside him as he holds an EU passport.
"I am thrilled to be joining Glamorgan," said van der Gugten.
"I have always been keen to play county cricket and I am pleased to have joined such an ambitious and passionate county."
