Cook, 29, has been dropped from the 15-man squad to play matches in Australia next month and the World Cup.
"I'm gutted to be left out of the World Cup squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment," he said.
England announced their World Cup squad on Saturday morning.
The decision to drop Cook was made following a selectors' meeting on Friday and follows a miserable year for the batsman in one-day cricket.
He failed to score a century in 45 one-day internationals and recently led England to a 5-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka, scoring only 119 runs in six matches.
England selector James Whitaker confirmed that Cook's lack of runs had prompted the decision to remove him as captain.
"Having reviewed the recent series against Sri Lanka, we came to the conclusion that there was no place for Alastair Cook amongst our strongest 15 one-day players," said Whitaker.
Morgan's first challenge as captain is to lead the side in a tri-series against Australia and India as warm-up for the World Cup in February.
He said: "It's a huge honour to captain England and I am delighted to be leading the one-day side.
"I firmly believe that with the players currently involved in the one-day set-up we have the makings of a very good one-day side, a young side that can surprise people at the World Cup.
"We all recognise we still have a lot of work to do on our one-day game but the potential of this group of players is huge and it is now up to us as players to turn that potential into consistent performances."
Like Cook, Morgan has also struggled for runs in recent times and scored only one half century in seven matches in Sri Lanka, but averages 71.16 in his eight previous matches as England one-day captain.
Paul Downton, managing director of the England and Wales Cricket Board, added: "I have complete confidence in the decision made by the selectors and having spent time with Alastair yesterday he accepts that it has been made in the best interests of the one-day side. "
