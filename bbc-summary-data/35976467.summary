First Bus said there had been three incidents on Doncaster Road in the past two weeks, including one in which a young woman passenger was injured.
The 22 and 22M services have had to be diverted after each incident.
South Yorkshire Police said the attacks were "totally unacceptable" as they were putting the public at risk.

Insp Richard Batty, from the Barnsley East Local Policing Team, said: "This kind of intimidating and aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated and, when identified, these individuals risk being arrested and could ultimately end up with a criminal conviction.
"We will have extra patrols in the area over the coming weeks."
First Bus spokesman Brandon Jones said the cemetery was a "hotspot" for attacks by youths hurling stones, rocks and other missiles at buses, taxis and emergency vehicles.
He said the latest incident happened at about 18:30 BST on Tuesday, leading to the 22 service being diverted for the rest of the night.
"The safety of our passengers and staff is what we're really concerned about but this also affects the whole community in terms of disruption to their services," said Mr Jones.
"Each time a bus window is hit it costs us about Â£1,000 if you add up the price of replacing the glass and the loss of income from taking a bus off the road."
Bus driver Walt Hoyle posted on BBC Radio Sheffield's Facebook page: "I was a driver on one of the buses that was hit and it is very scary when your passengers are covered in glass.
"On one bus a man was hit by a stone and an ambulance had to be called.
"The yobs who threw the stones knew this but continued to throw things at the buses. I had a bottle thrown through an open window and it covered passengers in glass."
