[SN]TITLE[SN]
Any Currency: Cheltenham Festival winner had banned substance in system

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Any Currency could be stripped of his win in the Glenfarclas Chase at March's Cheltenham Festival after traces of a prohibited substance were found in a urine sample taken after the race.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 13-year-old, trained by Martin Keighley, had Triamcinolone Acetonide (TCA) in his system.
The cortisone substance can be used legally to treat horses, but must have cleared their system by racedays.
Keighley faces a disciplinary hearing with the British Horseracing Authority.
Should Any Currency be disqualified, the runner-up - and 15-8 pre-race favourite - Josies Orders would be retrospectively awarded victory.
Bless The Wings finished third in a race that delivered trainer Keighley's first success at this year's famous jumps meeting.
The date for the disciplinary hearing has yet to be confirmed.
