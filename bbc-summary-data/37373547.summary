Team Jets face a season of consolidation in Premier League Two, according to head coach Linda Andrews.

The island side have lost the services of key players Abbie Hazley, Sophie Holmes and Georgia Hickey.
They are preparing to open their second campaign in the division at home to Telstars on Sunday, 2 October.
"Missing those three major players, we'll probably look to try and consolidate and give more girls court time," Andrews told BBC Radio Jersey.
Hazley recently got married, Holmes has a new job and Hickey is spending more time off the island, precluding any of the three players from being able to commit to the club's training and match regime.
"The team was gelling really well, but for personal reasons they want to have a little break, so we need to pull on from there really," Andrews continued.
"If we had had the whole squad there, we'd have gone for promotion right out, but I don't see any question in us doing that."
Andrews says there is still a chance for any players in the island who feel they are good enough to make the step up to the second tier of English club netball to stake their claim for a place in the side:
"I've been looking at the local league just to see if there's somebody out there who hasn't put their name forward yet and is of the right calibre and deserves the opportunity," she added.
"I'll keep doing that each week and just see. Everybody knows that Team Jets training is open and there are a couple of training partners that are a bit older and are showing their worth when we're playing games."
