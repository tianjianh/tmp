Cambridgeshire Police investigated Benjamin Morris, 32, after he was accused of travelling to the USA to assault a 14-year-old girl.
At Cambridge Crown Court, Morris, of Bourn Road, Cambridge, pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting the two boys when they were aged under 13-years-old.
He was also found guilty of assaulting the teenage girl in Vermont, USA.
Cambridgeshire Police said its investigation discovered Morris had befriended the boys in 2004, when they were aged eight and nine and attending an after school club.
He began to babysit them and assaulted them over a six year period, officers said.
Morris pleaded guilty to two counts of engaging in penetrative sex with the boys when they were under 13 and a further two counts of the same charge when they were under 16.
He was also found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a girl aged between 13 and 15.
Det Con Jo Nicholson said: "Morris abused his position of trust and showed no remorse for his actions, blaming the victims for what happened.
"I hope this sentence will provide some form of closure for the victims and allow them to move on with the rest of their lives."
Once he has served the prison sentence he will be on an extended licence for four years.
Morris was also placed on the sex offenders register for life and made subject of a sexual harm prevention order for life.
