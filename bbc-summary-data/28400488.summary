A green sea turtle migrated a staggering 3,979 km (2,472 miles) in a year, according to Swansea University researchers.

An aerial was attached to the back of eight turtles by scientists using satellite technology to monitor the species' habits.
The project found one travelled from the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean to the coast of Somalia in east Africa.
It is believed to be the furthest green sea turtle migration recorded.
The Swansea scientists, collaborating with colleagues in Australia and the Seychelles, were investigating the effectiveness of marine protected areas which have been set up by governments around the world over the last decade to improve conservation and protect species and biodiversity from damage and disturbance.

The study focused on the green sea turtles which breed on the Chagos Islands in the Chagos Archipelago which became a protected area in 2010, according to Prof Graeme Hays from the College of Science at Swansea University.
"The message from this research is that networks of small protected areas need to be developed alongside larger ones so species which migrate over long distances can stay in safe zones for as much time as possible," he said.

Nicole Esteban, a Swansea University researcher who has worked on the project, said: "Green sea turtles are an iconic species and their welfare tells us a lot about the health of our oceans.
"They forage in seagrass meadows which are being depleted because of pollution and other man-made causes.
"Our study helps determine the location of these important habitats, and also highlights the need to protect seagrass meadows, and make a network of small marine protected areas (MPAs)."
Last year, the Welsh government withdrew plans for 10 marine conservation zones in favour of exploring changes to 125 Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) that cover 36% of Welsh seas.
