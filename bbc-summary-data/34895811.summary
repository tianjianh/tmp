Radja put the Giants ahead late in the first period with Craig Peacock doubling the advantage three minutes after the resumption.
However, Nicholas Rioux replied for Fife in the 37th minute before Justin Fox levelled nine minutes from time.
But Radja hit the winner two minutes later as Belfast completed two victories in 24 hours over Fife.
Going into the weekend games, the Giants had already booked their spot in the Challenge Cup quarter-finals.
Chris Higgins, Adam Keefe and Darryl Lloyd were on target in Belfast's 3-0 win in Scotland on Saturday night.
