[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast builder Peter Hales sentenced over extensions work

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A builder was been sentenced to 100 hours community service for failing to complete work to a professional standard in two house extensions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peter Hales, 56, trading as 858 Building Services of Parklands, Belfast, was also ordered to pay a total of £2,000 in compensation.
The case followed complaints from two people who had hired Hales to build extensions at their homes.
Hales pleaded guilty to two charges at a previous hearing.
The case - concerning homes in Belfast and Coagh, County Tyrone - was brought by the Trading Standards Service (TSS).
One of the complainants paid Hales £25,500 to build a two-storey extension at his home.
Hales obtained large advances for the work, which he carried out to a poor standard and then removed himself from the job entirely, leaving the home in such disarray that the householder and his family had to live in rented accommodation.
An independent report estimated that only about £15,000 worth of work had been completed by Hales.
The other complainant had plans drawn up and approved by Building Control which he provided to Hales.
Hales replaced a block wall with a stud wall without checking the structural soundness of it with the structural engineer or building control. He also failed to stick to the agreed work and payment schedule.
Eventually, the complainant was left with no option but to pay another builder to rectify and finish Hales' work.
Lisa Mallon of the Trading Standards Service said: "There is evidence of a trader who appears to under quote the price of the job to ensure he secures the contract.
"He failed twice to follow plans approved for the clients by building control and walked away from the jobs without finishing the scheduled work, despite having made a profit.
"The victims in this case suffered a great deal of financial and emotional stress as a result of Mr Hales' actions."
