The 25-year-old midfielder submitted a transfer request last week, days after the club rejected a 100m euros (£90m) bid from Barcelona.
He missed Saturday's Premier League opener with Watford with a back injury.
"Nothing has changed. Not on one side or on the other," boss Jurgen Klopp said about the Brazilian on Monday.
"He is not available for us in the moment, that's the main issue if you want. He cannot play for Liverpool in this moment and, how everybody can imagine, that's quite a blow for us.
"We've known for a few days about it so we can prepare this game without him, like we have to prepare the game without Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge."
Barca have moved for Coutinho after selling Brazil team-mate Neymar to Paris St-Germain for a world record transfer of £200m.
Coutinho signed a new five-year deal in January, which did not include a release clause.
Liverpool start their European campaign with the first leg at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Germany, with the return clash at Anfield on Wednesday, 23 August.
The winner will progress to the group stage of the Champions League.
Liverpool squad: Alexander-Arnold, Moreno, Lovren, Milner, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Can, Mane, Salah, Firmino, Kent, Solanke, Origi, Gomez, Klavan, Flanagan, Robertson, Matip, Grujic, Mignolet, Karius, Ward.
