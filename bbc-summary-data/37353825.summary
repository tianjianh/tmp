Doctor quits over NI attorney general's abortion interventions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A paediatric pathologist has resigned over interventions by NI's attorney general on abortion laws surrounding fatal foetal abnormality.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Caroline Gannon investigated the deaths of babies including those in the womb or stillbirths.
She said the final straw was having to advise a couple to use a picnic cooler bag to return their baby's remains to NI following an abortion in England.
The attorney general said the law was under consideration.
A family can have a post-mortem examination carried out in England - but they are difficult to arrange.
Dr Gannon's resignation leaves Northern Ireland with only one paediatric pathologist.
She said the recent interventions by Attorney General John Larkin made her position untenable.
"The workload we had was manageable, but then when these rulings came out - that was the tipping point and for me, professionally," she told BBC News NI.
"I just felt I was acting unethically by taking part in this system where parents are denied a voice in what happens to their baby."
AG's interventions in NI abortion law:
Dr Gannon cited the example of one couple who wanted a post-mortem examination to find out why they had been told their baby had a fatal foetal abnormality.
As it remains illegal in Northern Ireland for an abortion to be carried out on the grounds of such a diagnosis, the couple had to travel to England for the termination.
The only way they could find to transport the remains home was in a cooler bag with ice packs.
"They're on their own in a strange town, a strange country in a private clinic with no support," said Dr Gannon, who has worked in Northern Ireland for almost 30 years.
Had the couple been in Northern Ireland, there would have been midwives present and hospital processes in place so they could sit with their baby, she added.
"Somebody else would be responsible for bringing their baby down to the mortuary to ensure the post mortem is carried out," she said.
"But they had to organise that themselves and transport their own baby's body back in a picnic cooler, in the boot of the car, on the overnight ferry."
The father of the woman involved said he travelled to England the day after his daughter with the cooler bag.
Describing the whole experience as traumatic for his family, he told the BBC's Talkback programme that he hoped the attorney general would never have to know what it felt like.
"It was horrendous and it's a terrible, terrible shame that Northern Ireland, in this day and age, has to look people straight in the eye around the world and say this is the way we deal with these things," he said.
"I just please hope that this will change the legislation because at least something good would have come out of the the most awful experience."
Attorney General statement
Mr Larkin previously argued that allowing terminations in cases of fatal foetal abnormality discriminated against children with disabilities.
He has also said there is no agreed clinical definition of fatal foetal abnormality.
The BBC understands several couples have used various modes of transport, including a parcel courier company, to transport the remains of their babies home.
Dr Gannon said she felt it was unethical to work in a system where women and couples were being "denied information and choice".
"I cannot reconcile the legal system I am having to operate under with my own personal ethical beliefs," she said.
