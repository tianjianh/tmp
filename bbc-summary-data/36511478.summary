Jonny Williams says Wales will be happy to draw Thursday's "massive" Euro 2016 qualifier with England in Lens.

Wales top Group B after they marked a first major finals appearance in 58 years by beating Slovakia, while England were held by Russia.
"Would a draw suit us? Realistically, yes it would," said Williams, 22.
"If we can stop them from winning, with us already having three points on the board then that would be a good result."
Williams, who was born in Pembury in Kent and qualifies for Wales through his father, thinks Chris Coleman's side now have the confidence to take the game to England.
"But I don't think we will be going out there to play for a draw, we want to win," he said.
"With the players we have and our defensive record, we should be targeting a win. Why not?
"England have some great players, great attackers, but we can't give them too much respect."

The Crystal Palace midfielder was a surprise inclusion in Chris Coleman's side for their opener and is ready to play whatever role he is handed against England.
"I want to start obviously, I felt I did a good job for the team and myself, but if the gaffer wants me to make an impact off the bench, that will be great also," Williams told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"It is about the whole group. We all want to fight for each other and Ben Davies' clearance off the line (against Slovakia) really sums us up as a team."
Williams revealed the Wales team found out the England result just before they flew back to their base in Dinard.
"We were all buzzing on the plane, we found out England had conceded and drawn the game just before we took off," he said.
"It was a bonus, finding out we were top of the group. The boys are still buzzing. We feel like we can achieve something special."
