[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 2-2 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa took his tally to 16 goals for the season but Wycombe had to settle for a point from a draw at Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The relegation-threatened Reds took the lead in first-half injury time when on-loan Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Sean Clare headed home his first league goal from a Jordan Clark corner.
Wycombe came back after the break when the powerful Akinfenwa headed in Michael Harriman's right-wing cross on 56 minutes.
And two minutes later Akinfenwa had his second when he got the ball in the area from Joe Jacobson, turned and fired into the net to put Wycombe ahead.
However Stanley responded on 63 minutes when defender Matty Pearson headed home a Clark free-kick at the far post.
Wycombe keeper Jamal Blackman tipped over a Mark Hughes header and Clark hit the woodwork as Stanley looked for the winner.
But Wanderers also pressed with Akinfenwa unable to poke the ball home for his hat-trick in a goalmouth scramble and Max Muller also seeing an attempt cleared.
Wycombe appealed a Jacobson corner had crossed the line in injury time but referee Mark Brown waved away the appeals as both sides settled for a point.
