Ben Fletcher took silver in the -100kg category, with a bronze for team-mate Philip Awiti-Alcaraz.
In the -78kg category, Natalie Powell gained her 15th Grand Prix medal with silver, and Sarah Adlington won bronze.
Brazil were top of the medal table with five golds, and eight in total. Britain's nine medals consisted of four silvers and five bronzes.
Kate Howey, Britain's elite performance coach, said the team were preparing well for the World Championships in Hungary.
"Overall we have had a good tournament and have come away with nine medals, which is pretty impressive from a Grand Prix," she said.
"We now have to get back into training and finish preparation for the World Championships at the end of August."
