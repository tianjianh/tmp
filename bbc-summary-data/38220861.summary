Zero-hours contracts: 'Right to review' for public sector staff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Public sector staff on contracts without guaranteed hours will be entitled to reviews if they work regular shifts, under proposals from the Welsh Government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ministers have published guidelines for such staff, including people on zero-hours contracts.
The Welsh Government has pledged to ensure zero-hours contracts are not misused in devolved public services.
Plaid Cymru has criticised ministers for not banning them in social care.
Staff on such contracts can request a review "with a view to changing their contractual arrangement" if they have been working regular hours - for example four hours a week for three months.
The guidelines say devolved public services should regularly review whether non-guaranteed hours are appropriate.
Employers are also told they should involve trade unions as part of a "'Welsh Way' of social partnership".
