BBC Wales has agreed the sale of its Cardiff HQ in Llandaff to house builder Taylor Wimpey.

The sale has been agreed on the condition the developer secures planning permission for up to 500 homes on the two sites.
In June the broadcaster unveiled plans to move to a new, purpose-built centre outside Cardiff Central rail station.
The sale of the current sites will help fund the new development and staff are expected to move in 2018.
Taylor Wimpey's proposed development, which would create 100 construction jobs and a further 300 in the supply chain, includes BBC Wales' Ty Oldfield building on the opposite side of Llantrisant Road.
The firm's land director, Gareth Hawke, said it would combine private and affordable homes, car parking and public open space, with the first properties expected to go on sale in early 2019.
The decision to relocate followed a three-year study, prompted by the ageing facilities in Llandaff and the need to modernise the outdated and unreliable technology.
Commenting on the news of the conditional sale, director of BBC Wales, Rhodri Talfan Davies said: "Our sites in Llandaff have served us well for nearly half a century.
"But the technology and facilities here are showing their age and our new home will enable us to strengthen our programmes and services."
"I believe the exciting plans for our new home in Central Square make real creative and financial sense for the BBC and have the potential to play a pivotal role in unlocking the regeneration of an important part of our capital city," he added.
Cardiff council leader, Phil Bale said BBC Wales' relocation to Central Square was a major statement of confidence in its plans to build a public square worthy of any European capital.
Final approval for BBC Wales' move will be sought later this year.
