Albertina Choules, 81, known as Tina, died at her home in Ragmans Lane, Marlow, just after 06:30 BST on Wednesday.
A man arrested on suspicion of murder remains in police custody.
Thames Valley Police officers are expected to remain at the scene for several days.
The force said an officer who was assaulted by a man when he arrived at the property was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been discharged.
Ms Choules's niece, who is her only relative in this country, and some of her close friends told the BBC she had lived at her home for more than 45 years.
They added that she had lived alone since her husband died 2004 but was "completely unafraid of being in such an isolated spot".
Friends have said the woman, who was of Italian descent and had no children, was a "perfectionist who did everything with love" and "believed if a job was worth doing it was worth doing well".
Simone Smith, who lives nearby in Marlow Bottom, said she often waved to Ms Choules and was "shocked and nervous" about what had happened.
"It's terrible, that sort of thing doesn't happen here," she said.
"You just can't tell can you, it's horrible, really horrible."
Neighbour Rona Hyde said: "As a community we are devastated knowing what a good person she was ... open and friendly.
"She was a soulful lady, very spiritual and would make Buddhist stupas (monuments) in the woods."
