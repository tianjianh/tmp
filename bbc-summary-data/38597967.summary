A pilot whose light aircraft hit a moving van during takeoff had attempted to manoeuvre around the vehicle, an air accident report says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Socata TB9 "clipped" a Nottinghamshire County Council van which was driving along a road at the end of Lambley Airstrip on 24 March.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report said the 69-year-old pilot tried to climb the plane when he spotted the van during takeoff.
The driver and pilot were uninjured.

The AAIB report said the pilot had reached the desired speed half way along the private airstrip when he saw the van travelling in a southerly direction on the road near the end of the runway.
Fearing a collision he attempted to climb but, as he did, the right wing dropped and struck the van detaching itself from the aircraft.
The aircraft slid to a halt in a field on the other side of the road.
It was damaged beyond economic repair, the report said.
It added that the pilot, who had 839 hours of flying experience, had miscalculated how much runway he needed for takeoff.
The report stated that he lined up further down the runway as the first 131ft (40m) were too soft.
