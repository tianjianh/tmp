Last month, the Taliban announced the start of their "spring offensive" a week after killing at least 135 Afghan soldiers in a military compound near the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.
The group said it would use military alongside political tactics, and that its main target would be foreign forces.
The attacks in Kandahar follow raids on police outposts in central the central Zabul province on Sunday, which left at least 20 officers dead.
The US and other Nato allies are considering sending thousands more troops to back up the Afghan military as it battles the insurgency.
US combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but special forces have continued to provide support to Afghan troops.
The Taliban is believed  to control up to a third of Afghanistan, after gaining ground in the past two years.
