The 22-year-old Ivorian has not scored in 12 appearances for the Spireites this season.
He could make his debut for League Two's bottom side in Tuesday's home match against Mansfield.
"Armand is a big, powerful striker who I'm delighted to be able to bring to the club," boss Micky Adams told the club's official website.
