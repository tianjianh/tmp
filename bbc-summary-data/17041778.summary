Tottenham midfielder Tom Huddlestone will have further surgery on his ankle injury and miss the rest of the season as a result, the club have confirmed.

"Thanks for messages! My season is over before it's even started. Operation Friday," said Huddlestone on Twitter.
"My main objective is to make sure I'm 100% for pre-season."
The 25-year-old has made just four appearances for the club this season because of the injury and first had surgery late last year.
Tottenham now say he requires further surgery to complete his recovery from the ligament damage and the club are expecting him to return in time for pre-season training.
"The midfielder has progressed well since his initial surgery," the club said in a statement.
"The specialist has determined that the anticipated reconstruction of a lateral ankle ligament is the next step towards the England international making a return to full fitness."
Huddlestone has established himself as a key figure in the Spurs set-up in recent years following his move to White Hart Lane from Derby in 2005.
He made more starts than any other outfield player in all competitions in the 2009-10 season as Tottenham finished fourth in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League for the first time.
