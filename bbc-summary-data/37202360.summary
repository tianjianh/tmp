[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-1 Chesterfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dom Poleon's last-gasp goal secured AFC Wimbledon their first-ever League One victory as they beat Chesterfield at Kingsmeadow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half was short of action but it was the visitors who looked the more threatening.
With half an hour played, Ched Evans drove in to the Dons area but saw his effort palmed over the bar by Ryan Clarke. Just moments later, Reece Mitchell dragged an effort across the face of the goal.
Sam Hird then found the opening for the Spireites, as he headed a corner that deflected off Darius Charles and went down as an own goal.
The early period of the second half saw the visitors' domination continue, but the Dons found an equaliser against the run of play.
Defender Paul Robinson latched onto a George Francomb corner and guided the ball past Chesterfield keeper Ryan Fulton.
A combination of excellent saves and poor finishing saw the sides heading towards the final whistle with a point each.
The Dons, however, found a winner in the first minute of stoppage time when substitute Poleon neatly swivelled and fired home.
