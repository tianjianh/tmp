[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour's new leader Kezia Dugdale has confirmed more of her front bench appointments.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They include a role for Neil Findlay who will be the party's trade union liaison, reporting directly to the leader.
Ms Dugdale announced her key front bench appointments earlier this week.
Lothians MSP Mr Findlay was previously health spokesman and stood for the party leadership last year against Jim Murphy.
He will be part of the equality team led by Jenny Marra.
Rhoda Grant and Drew Smith also join Ms Marra's team while Iain Gray, the party's opportunity spokesman, will be supported by Mark Griffin and John Pentland.
Elaine Murray joins Graeme Pearson on the justice brief while Jackie Baillie, public services and wealth creation spokeswoman, is supported by Richard Simpson, Lewis Macdonald and Siobhan McMahon.
There are also roles for Michael McMahon, Jayne Baxter, Claudia Beamish, David Stewart and Anne McTaggart on the community, environment and democracy teams.
Ms Dugdale said: "I am excited about the future and want my front bench team to get out and about across the country making clear our positive Labour vision for transforming Scotland.
"In recent times people have said they don't know what Labour stands for. That won't be the case under my leadership - people will know what we stand for and who we stand with.
"We stand for a Scotland where a person's ability to get on in life is determined by their potential, work rate and ambition, not by their background.
"That's what Labour stands for and that's the message I want my new front bench team to take out with them across Scotland."
