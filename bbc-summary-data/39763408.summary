Belfast Marathon: Thousands take part in 36th annual race

More than 15,000 runners are pounding the streets of Belfast for the city's 36th annual marathon.

The city is a flurry of colour as the biggest sporting event in Northern Ireland's calendar includes relay teams, wheelchair racing and a fun run.
Kilkeel mother-of-four Laura Graham won the women's race in a personal best time of 2:41:47.
Bernard Rotich won the men's race in 2:16:04, beating Kenyan compatriots Daniel Tanui and Emmanuel Kiprotich.
The event started at Belfast City Hall and finishes in the Ormeau Park, with many competitors raising funds for this year's official charity Mencap - and lots taking part in fancy dress.
Graham, 31, is the first woman from Northern Ireland to triumph since Barbara Brewer in 1999.
"It doesn't feel real," she told BBC News NI. "I feel I've yet to wake up!"
Rotich broke clear at the 23-mile mark after a leading group of five finally began to fragment.
"In 2014 I was here, I was not well prepared because I had an injury, but today I was very impressed with the time I ran," he told BBC News NI.
It was understandably slower going at Ravenhill Road, over 25 miles into the race.
Determination powered most runners as they edged closer to the finish line, along with the prospect of sweet relief.
Thankfully, they were getting plenty of support from those at the roadside.
"C'mon, you're almost there, keep going!" was the urgent chorus to the steady beat of pounding feet.
A local church offered free burgers and pumped out Eye of the Tiger - if it's good enough for Rocky, then it's good enough for a marathon.
Just around the corner and into Ormeau Park, the finish line was in sight - cheers, applause, fast food and massages for tired limbs.
A sweet reward for a marathon effort.
The weather is good for running conditions: A cool start, warming up a little later in the day and with little wind to throw runners off course.
All Belfast quarters are represented in the route, which is relatively flat going - although organisers say miles nine through to 14 are hillier.
There are 12 water stations which will also be distributing energy drinks and energy gels for runners.
Organiser David Seaton said the mix of events had been key to Belfast marathon's success over the years.
