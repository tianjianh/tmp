Port Vale sign striker Robinson and Cardiff loan winger Kennedy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Port Vale have signed striker Theo Robinson until the end of the season, as well as bringing in winger Matthew Kennedy from Championship side Cardiff City on a month's loan.

The much-travelled Robinson, 27, moves to the Potteries after leaving Scottish Premier League side Motherwell, where he spent the first half of the season.
Kennedy, 21, has been limited to 12 minutes of league action this term.
Both could play on Tuesday at fellow League One mid-table side Doncaster.
But that would be subject to international clearance for both players.
Vale stand 11th in League One on the back of a run of one defeat in four games for Welshman Rob Page's side.
Birmingham-born Jamaica international Theo Robinson has made five appearances for his country.
After beginning his career under Ady Boothroyd at Watford, he was loaned out to non-league Wealdstone, Hereford United and Southend United during his four years at Vicarage Road.
He has since played for Huddersfield Town, Millwall, Derby County, where he scored 21 times in 70 appearances, and Doncaster Rovers, going on to have further loan spells back at Huddersfield and then at Scunthorpe.
Scotland Under-21 player Matthew Kennedy signed his first professional contract as a 16-year-old with Kilmarnock in August 2010 before signing for Everton in 2012.
He joined Cardiff on a three-and-half-year deal in the last January window. Prior to that, he had been out on loan at Tranmere Rovers, MK Dons and Hibernian.
He made 14 Cardiff appearances last season but has played just twice this time round, the second of them being the final half hour of the Bluebirds' FA Cup third-round defeat by Shrewsbury Town.

Port Vale chairman Norman Smurthwaite, who put the League One club up for sale in December, has told BBC Radio Stoke that he hopes to have sold the club by the end of next month.
He is currently speaking to three parties who are interested in taking over at Vale Park - and he thinks there will be some serious progress over the next few weeks.
"I think the deal will be done by one of the parties if it's going to happen by the end of February," said Smurthwaite, who has been involved with the Potteries club since November 2012.
