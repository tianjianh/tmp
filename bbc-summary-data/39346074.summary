Movistar completed the 43.3km course to Banyoles two seconds faster than BMC, with Briton Froome's Team Sky in third.
The Trek-Segafredo team of Spain's Alberto Contador, another favourite for overall victory, was one minute 15 seconds behind.
Valverde leads the seven-stage Spanish race after a penalty to a team-mate.
Jose Joaquin Rojas had been declared the new race leader but was later punished with a three-minute time penalty for "pushing a team-mate", race organisers said.
Wednesday's third stage is an 188.3km ride from Mataro that features three category one climbs on the way to La Molina.
"It's a first big effort back at a Pro Tour level this season," said Froome, now 18th in the overall standings.
"We'll see what we can do in the next few days. Hopefully we've got a few cards to play, with La Molina tomorrow and a big mountain-top finish on Friday.
"We're not the only ones who have lost time, so it might be in all of our interests to ride an aggressive race. Hopefully we'll light things up at some point."
