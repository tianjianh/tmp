The northbound carriageway was closed at 02:00 on Thursday at junctions five, Castle Bromwich and six, Spaghetti Junction and was not reopened until about 01:30 GMT on Friday.
A 26-year-old man driving a Saab died at the scene.
A 200m-length section across four lanes had to be resurfaced after a fuel spillage, Highways England said.

A Highways England spokesman said earlier: "You've got about a 200m stretch - so that's 800m across all four lanes.
"Fuel has leaked on to the carriageway and it's really got into the carriageway, so that's the problem and it's just not safe to reopen."
Traffic jams trailed back to junction four for the M42.
Drivers were stuck for hours in congestion on the M42 north from junctions six to nine and on the A446 around Coleshill.
Many of the main routes into Birmingham slowed to a crawl as people tried to find alternative routes.

Two lanes closed on the northbound carriageway of the M6 at junction 3A near Coleshill after a separate traffic collision at 12:30 reopened by 13:00, said Highways England.
Drivers expressed their anger on social media at being caught in the congestion in and around Birmingham during Thursday's rush hour.
Paul Davis tweeted at 10:00 he had only managed to drive six miles after leaving from Sutton Coldfield at 07:00.
Earlier Virgin Trains said it had advised its ticket managers at Birmingham International to use discretion towards commuters in light of the disruption.
Police had hoped to reopen the northbound lanes at about 07:30 on Thursday, but Highways England said extensive damage had been caused and assessment and repair work was being carried out.
Diversions were put in place but motorists were caught up in long delays on surrounding routes, particularly on the A38.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said the lorry driver in the collision was shaken but uninjured.
