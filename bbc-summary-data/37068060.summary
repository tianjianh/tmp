Lincoln City 4-0 Southport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four goals from Jonny Margetts helped Lincoln get back to winning ways with a thumping 4-0 triumph over 10-man Southport at Sincil Bank.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Hull and Tranmere forward opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a header from Terry Hawkridge's free-kick before Adam Marriott put him through again on the half-hour mark and he made no mistake.
Southport's frustrations boiled over when former Lincoln midfielder Ashley Grimes saw a straight red for kicking out at Alex Woodyard after 35 minutes.
Margetts then added to Southport's woes by completing his hat-trick in first-half stoppage-time with a neat turn and finish, and then adding his fourth with a penalty in the 79th minute after Harry Anderson was felled.
In between, Southport keeper Ty Belford redeemed himself after tripping Margetts by saving Hawkridge's spot-kick.
