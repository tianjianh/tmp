Scott Flinders: Macclesfield Town sign York City goalkeeper on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macclesfield Town have signed York City goalkeeper Scott Flinders on a one-month loan deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old recently served a five-match ban after being found guilty of racial abuse during a match in March - a charge he strenuously denied.
Before that, he had started York's first four National League games of the season and played against the Silkmen in York's 1-0 win in August.
He is available to feature in the match at Guiseley on Saturday.
