Angry reaction to contaminated blood probe findings

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some victims and relatives have reacted angrily to a long-awaited report on the Scottish inquiry into contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s.

Prime Minister David Cameron has apologised to the thousands of people infected with Hepatitis C and HIV.
It followed the publication of the Penrose Inquiry, which found little could have been done differently.
At the inquiry's news conference, shouts of "whitewash" could be heard from the public gallery.
Hundreds of those affected were in Scotland, which was the only part of the UK to hold an inquiry.
The findings of the 1,800-page report were presented at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh following a six-year wait.
The inquiry's single recommendation was that steps should be taken to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who has not already been tested for Hepatitis C.
Bruce Norville contracted the disease after being infected with contaminated blood. He said: "Today's report is Â£12m worth of nonsense.
"It doesn't match the evidence that was given to the inquiry. It seems disjointed, broken and nonsensical in significant places.
He added: "Hepatitis C has robbed me of the ability to maintain employment.
"It is a very difficult, hard existence."
Health Secretary Shona Robison has also apologised on behalf of the NHS and the Scottish government and has accepted the findings of the report.
Mr Norville said: "An apology does not accept responsibility. It would mean far more if it was involved with realistic support and compensation for victims."
He and other victims and relatives have called for a UK-wide inquiry on the back of today's findings.
William Murphy from Liverpool died in 1994, aged 59, after he contracted Hepatitis C through infected blood products.
His son Gregory said: "After 30 years, we are still nowhere near reaching the truth in our fight. Why are we still waiting for justice?
He added: "We will not rest until the truth emerges."
