Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen says his future at Anfield could depend on the chances he is given in pre-season.

Allen has one year left on his Liverpool contract and started only 19 games in the entire campaign.
"I think it hinges on the pre-season plans and what exactly the club are hoping to do, everything comes into that," Allen explained.
"As a footballer you want to play every minute of every game. That's been the challenge for me."
Allen discussed his future at the club in January but it was decided to hold off on a decision until the summer.
Liverpool spent Â£15million on Allen in August 2012.
"There was a conversation with the club in terms of what the future did hold for me, if I would feature more or if I would feature in the plans moving forward," Allen said at Wales' pre-Euro 2016 training camp in Portugal.
"They [chief executive Ian Ayre and manager Jurgen Klopp] made it clear at that stage I wouldn't be moving anywhere.
"I knew where I stood, and it was good to have that conversation and know that I had the second half of the season to look forward to with Liverpool.
"As soon as the season finished with Liverpool I said to myself, 'I don't want to have any distractions and I am fully focussed and engaged on purely all things Wales'.
"That's where I am at the moment."
Allen feels his season improved, along with Liverpool's, after the appointment of Klopp.
"What was great about the second half of the season was all the different competitions and how far we went," Allen said.
"There was so much to play for and every player in the squad had a part to play.
"The support [from the fans] has been brilliant in the last few months.
"It's always great for a player, it always helps you when you step out on the pitch. I've enjoyed that and it made things easier.
"People have talked about the improvement in my game this year, but it's almost a back-handed compliment in some ways.
"In the first half of the season I hadn't played. I'm 26, not 36, so I am still developing and improving.
"I'd be very disappointed if I said at the end of any year that I hadn't improved as the season had gone on."
