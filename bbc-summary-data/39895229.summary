[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knife attacker has been found guilty of the attempted murder of a woman in her own home in the Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Court in Edinburgh heard that Ian McGregor, 30, stabbed his 57-year-old victim more than 40 times.
He had denied attempting to murder her in her Kelso home on 25 October last year.
However, a jury unanimously convicted him of the offence and also attempting to defeat the ends of justice. He will be sentenced next month.
McGregor, described as a prisoner in Edinburgh, launched his assault on Elspeth Burns as she lay in bed after suffering from a migraine.
He had been at her house earlier in the day and returned, entering through an unlocked door, before trying to murder her.
The court heard his victim woke up as McGregor was stabbing her.
She told the court that she had said to him: "What are you doing? Get off me, get off me."
After the attack she got up but collapsed and shouted for help.
She was taken to hospital and was found to have wounds to her head, neck, back and chest.
A doctor described her injuries as extremely serious. She was found to have a punctured lung and an injury near her carotid artery.
McGregor had denied attempting to murder her by repeatedly stabbing her on the head and body to her severe injury, permanent disfigurement and to the danger of her life.
He told the court he had been at his brother's home at the time when the attack occurred.
However, a jury unanimously convicted him and also found him guilty of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
The judge, Lord Summers, called for a background report on him ahead of sentencing next month and he was detained in custody.
