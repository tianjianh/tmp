Dundee United: Ryan McGowan and Aidan Connolly exit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United have agreed to sell Ryan McGowan to Chinese club Henan Jianye while midfielder Aidan Connolly has been released from Tannadice.

Australia right-back McGowan joined United last January after leaving Shandog Luneng but will return to China's top flight for a £300,000 fee.
McGowan is now on his way to China for a medical after the clubs reached agreement earlier this week.
And United say 20-year-old Connolly has left the club "by mutual consent".
The midfielder joined United from Queen's Park in 2013 and has made 35 appearances for the Terrors.
But most of those came as a substitute - and while Jackie McNamara was manager.
Connolly has made only four substitute appearances since Mixu Paatelainen took over, the most recent of these being a 1-1 draw with Kilmarnock in early December.
McGowan first arrived in Scotland to join Hearts in 2008 after leaving Para Hills in his homeland.
Following loan spells with Ayr United and Partick Thistle, he became a regular in the Tynecastle club's first team before being sold to Shandog Luneng for £400,000 in January 2013.
Despite scoring in the Chinese FA Cup final, the club decided not to extend his contract and he joined United almost exactly a year ago.
McGowan has made 41 appearances for United but becomes the latest player to exit United as Paatelainen reshapes a squad that are 14 points adrift at the bottom of the Scottish Premiership.
Henan Jianye finished in fifth place in the Chinese Super League last season and are preparing for their new campaign.
