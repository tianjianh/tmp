Routes considered for Metro tram extension in Digbeth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two routes are being considered for the Â£127m Midland Metro tram extension in Birmingham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first of the proposed routes in Digbeth would run along Fazeley Street and Liverpool Street.
The second would run along New Canal Street, Meriden Street and High Street in Deritend. Both routes would finish in Adderley Street.
People are being asked for their thoughts on the plans before the deadline on 31 October.
A tram route from Bull Street to the proposed HS2 high speed rail station at Curzon Street has already been agreed.
Transport chiefs secured extra government money in the summer to take the extension further into Digbeth. It could open by 2023.
Centro chairman John McNicholas said: "This project will help shape the future of our region and the views of the public are an important part of the process."
The tram extension is part of a wider plan drawn up by the city council and Centro for land around the HS2 station.
