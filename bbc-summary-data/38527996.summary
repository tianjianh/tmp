The 18-year-old was attacked in Dallas Chicken in Brixton by three masked men armed with knives and belts.
He was stabbed four times and needed an operation on his abdomen following the assault on 2 January.
One man was later arrested on suspicion of possession of a knife and the Met has released CCTV to help find four other suspects.
The footage shows at least three men whipping, punching and kicking several people.
One of the attackers can then be seen drawing a knife and thrusting it forward while holding a mobile phone in his other hand.
The teenager was hit in the face with a belt then stabbed several times by one of the suspects.
When he fell to the floor one of the suspects stabbed him again before kicking him in the head.
He has since been discharged from hospital but requires further surgery.
Det Con Remy Smith said: "This is a shocking and brutal assault that has left the victim very distressed from his ordeal. "
