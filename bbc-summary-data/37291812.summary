The 30-year-old, who came through the ranks with Ajax in his homeland and also played for AC Milan, was a free agent after leaving Verona.
He has won 16 international caps and also had a spell on loan with Fulham under Martin Jol in 2013.
Emanuelson will be available to play in Saturday's home game against Wigan.
Details about the length of his contract have yet to be disclosed.
"The Championship is new to me but I know it is a long season, with lots of games and a lot of competition. It is a tough division but I hope I can help the team and show the fans what I'm all about," he told the club website.
