The 11-4 favourite and defending champion finished ahead of Pallasator in second and Sheikhzayedroad in third.
Trained by Michael Bell, five-year-old Big Orange took an early lead and won by over a length at Glorious Goodwood.
"He wears his heart on his sleeve. He's a big strong galloper and he's got stronger since last year and can sustain top speed," said Spencer.
"I always wanted to be leading or sat second, but he got on with it and put them to the sword."
On day three of five at the annual Goodwood Festival, the race took place in wet and gloomy conditions.
But Big Orange led from the off, becoming the first winner of back-to-back Goodwood Cups since Double Trigger in 1997 and '98.

"We usually think of Jamie Spencer as a jockey that prefers to hold up his mount, and consequently he takes more flak than most because that style inevitably doesn't always work out.
"But the joint-champion jockey of 2007 is very effective when in front too, as here when he judged the whole race to perfection, and though others threw down some obviously strong challenges there was always room for manoeuvre to see them off.
"Big Orange, who continues to improve with age, ran a cracker in last year's Melbourne Cup, and let's hope he might go back to try to become the first GB winner in November."
Earlier, would-be Olympic eventing rider Izzy Taylor won the Magnolia Cup charity flat-race on Alketios.
Taylor was ruled out of competing in Rio earlier this month because of an injury to her horse Allercombe Ellie.
"It was absolutely phenomenal," said Taylor. "From my point of view, and what I do, which is 10 or 12 minutes of galloping, it's over in a blink of an eye.
"It's very different to Rio, but it's a good thing to be doing and hopefully raising some money for charity."
Earlier, Frankie Dettori moved closer to earning his 3,000th British winner by claiming the Richmond Stakes with Mehmas.
Dettori, 45, is now just five wins short of the milestone.
"I don't think I will get there this week," said the Italian, who is booked to ride at nine more races at this year's Goodwood Festival.
"I will get there when I get there, it's not important."
Jockey Aidan O'Brien and trainer Ryan Moore claimed the British Stallion Studs Maiden Fillies' Stakes with 10-11 favourite Rhododendron, who earned quotes of around 20-1 for next year's Qipco 1000 Guineas.
Elsewhere, Mark Johnston secured his third winner of the meeting as 8-1 shot Bear Valley took the Telegraph Nursery, while You're Hired was a 9-1 winner of the Exchange Stakes for Amanda Perrett and Martin Dwyer.
The concluding Tatler Stakes went to the Kevin Ryan-trained Laughton (13-2) in the hands of Shane Gray.
