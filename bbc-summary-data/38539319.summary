[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth 2-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conor Chaplin missed a penalty and scored a brace as Portsmouth beat Leyton Orient 2-1 at Fratton Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chaplin took his goal tally to seven for the season and is now Pompey's leading goalscorer along with Gary Roberts.
Pompey were awarded a penalty in the 21st minute after Enda Stevens was fouled by defender Sammy Moore just inside the box.
Chaplin stepped up to take the spot-kick but Orient's goalkeeper Alex Cisak guessed the right way and parried the ball out for a corner.
The striker made amends for his miss two minutes later when he stabbed the ball home at the far post from a Carl Baker cross.
Orient were level in the 38th minute when Massey was picked out by former Pompey player Nigel Atangana and curled his shot exquisitely into the top corner from just inside the area.
Portsmouth regained their lead two minutes after half-time when Chaplin headed home from close range after Baker's cross from the right-hand side.
