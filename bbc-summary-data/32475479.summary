Pep Guardiola's side beat Hertha Berlin 1-0 on Saturday to put them within sight of the title.
Wolfsburg had to beat Gladbach to make Bayern wait another week for a 24th Bundesliga title and 25th overall championship, but lost to a Max Kruse goal. The Bundesliga started in 1963.
Bayern are still in the Champions League and German Cup semis.
They will have little time to celebrate this success as they face rivals Borussia Dortmund in the last four of the domestic cup on Tuesday.
Bayern are bidding for their third consecutive domestic double, and second treble in three years.
Guardiola has won five domestic titles in his six years as a manager; three out of four with Barcelona and now two in two for Bayern.
The Bavarians face Barca in the Champions League semi-finals in May.
Chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said: "Retaining the title is a magnificent achievement. All credit to the coach and the team. They've been fantastic throughout, in a season following a World Cup where we had a host of players in action.
"We'll have a magnificent party at some stage, no worries. But all in good time. When we do, it'll be a huge celebration."
