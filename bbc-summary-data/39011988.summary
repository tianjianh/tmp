[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 0-1 Cheltenham Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cheltenham Town took a valuable three points in their quest to move away from the League Two relegation zone with victory at fellow strugglers Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Winchester's goal earned them the points against second-from-bottom Orient at Brisbane Road.
Winchester scored the only goal of the game on 21 minutes but it was visiting keeper Scott Brown who earned the plaudits with a string of outstanding saves.
The Robins created the early chances but Tin Plavotic and then Kyle Wootton fired wide when well-placed.
The O's stormed back and were only denied the lead because of the heroics of visiting shot-stopper Brown who was in scintillating form.
He twice blocked point-blank shots from Gavin Massey and then produced another double save, firstly denying Paul McCallum and then Nigel Atangana.
Winchester broke the deadlock when he collected a pass from Billy Waters before unleashing a powerful drive into the net from outside the penalty area.
Orient squandered a wonderful opportunity to restore parity on 56 minutes when Massey was fouled in the penalty area but man-of-the-match Brown flung himself to his left to palm Callum Kennedy's spot kick around the post.
From thereon, Cheltenham had little difficulty in protecting their lead to leave Orient with their 14th home league defeat of the season.
