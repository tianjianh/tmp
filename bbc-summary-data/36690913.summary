The pair had silver snatched from their grasp at London 2012, and did the same to Lithuania's Aurimas Lankas and Edvinas Ramanauskas this time around.
The Brits produced a strong finish to beat the Lithuanians by 0.014 seconds.
"We gave it a bit of a lunge for the line," said Heath. "We hit it as hard as we can."
Schofield added: "It is so satisfying. This guy has been on fire in training. I don't want to let this guy down."
