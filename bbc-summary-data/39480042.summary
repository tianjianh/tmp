During December 2014 and February 2015, he bombarded her with abusive Facebook messages, threatening to release intimate images.
He also hired two men, Matthew Barker and Joden Smith, to carry out a string of attacks on her home, culminating with her car being set on fire in February 2015.
Barker, 44, of Leicester, admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage and was jailed for 43 months.
Smith, 20, also of Leicester, admitted conspiracy to commit criminal damage and arson, recklessly endangering life and was sentenced to four years at a young offenders institution.
The men were sentenced at Wolverhampton Crown Court on 31 March.
