A surprise looked possible when Ireland bowler Kim Garth took three early wickets to leave the Aussies on 38-4.
However, Ellyse Perry's 39 helped Australian post a decent 131-6 at Claremont Road.
Claire Shillington and Cecelia Joyce departed cheaply for the Irish with Isobel Joyce their top scorer on 29 as they finished on 76-7.
The teams meet in the final match of the series at the same venue on Saturday when Ireland will be hoping for a consolation win.
