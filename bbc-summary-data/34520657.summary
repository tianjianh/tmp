Kai Webb, 18, downed a bottle of vodka before attacking David Reynolds as he ran along Teignmouth seafront in Devon.
Webb, of Ashleigh Park, Teignmouth, admitted wounding, theft and two common assaults and was jailed at Exeter Crown Court for 12 months.
Mr Reynolds and his partner Eve Hazelton raised almost Â£30,000 for the breast cancer charity Coppafeel.
The couple were part way through running 10km a day for 100 days on 11 April when they were intercepted by a group of youths, including Webb, at about 19:00.
Webb walked up behind Mr Reynolds and smashed the bottle over the back of his head, causing a gash to the scalp and ear which required eight stitches.
A large group of supporters turned out to support film director Mr Reynolds the next day, when he overcame his injuries and ran dressed as a giant beer bottle.
Recorder Martin Meeke QC told Webb: "This was mindless unprovoked violence in a town centre and the sort of conduct which persuades many members of the public to avoid town centres at night."
Gordon Richings, prosecuting, said the bottle attack happened after Webb had already stolen beer and thrown a tray at an assistant in a sandwich shop.
In a victim impact statement, Mr Reynolds said: "My injury is very evident to other people as I have no hair."
Barry White, defending, said Webb was only 17 when the attacks took place and his family are at a loss to explain why he behaved as he did.
