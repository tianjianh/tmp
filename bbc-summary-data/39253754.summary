Miura scored for Yokohoma FC in a 1-0 J-League Division 2 win over Thespa Kusatsu at the age of 50 years and 14 days, breaking his own record.
"I had the vibes of a goal. I was just trying to stay positive," the former Japan forward told Kyodo news.
Miura, who scored 55 goals in 89 caps for his country, signed a new contract with Yokohama FC in January.
He started his career in Brazil with Santos, making his professional debut in 1986, and had brief spells with Italian side Genoa and Dinamo Zagreb of Croatia in the 1990s.
The forward joined Yokohama in 2005 at the age of 38.
The sport's world governing body Fifa could not confirm if Miura is the oldest goalscorer in professional football.
The oldest goalscorer in international football is Billy Meredith, who netted for Wales against England aged 45 years and 73 days in 1919.
He also scored for Manchester City against Brighton in the FA Cup at the age of 49 years and 208 days in 1924.
