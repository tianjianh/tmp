Manchester Airport's terminal two was evacuated after a unattended bag was found which turned out not to be suspicious, police said.

Part of the terminal building was cordoned off "as a precaution, while an investigation takes place," an airport spokesman said.
The spokesman said it has resulted in "some passengers being evacuated" from the building.
Police later said there was "nothing untoward" about the bag.
Terminal two is a hub for charter flights and the evacuation has led to delays for scores of passengers.
Passenger Aqib Ishtiaq, 33, from Blackburn arrived at the terminal on a flight from Islamabad at about 18:30 BST.
He said he received a text from his brother Khawer, who had arrived to pick him up, to say he was "not allowed out of the car park."
Mr Ishtiaq said once they had left the plane at 19:20, they found all their bags on the floor, not on the baggage carousel.
Members of airport staff told them to pick up their bags and to leave.
