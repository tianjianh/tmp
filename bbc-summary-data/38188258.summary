Thomson had led for the majority of the race but Le Cleac'h took over when the Welshman suffered a damaged foil after hitting an object.
The Gosport-based sailor regained the lead north of the Kerguelen Islands in the Indian Ocean on 30 November.
The 42-year-old broke two race records prior to being overtaken, as he reached the Cape of Good Hope in record time.
After 25 days, the 29 yachts that started have been cut to 25 with almost 4,850 nautical miles gone.
The solo non-stop round-the-world race started on the west coast of France on 6 November. The winner is expected back in port around 20 January.
The Vend√©e Globe takes place every four years and Thomson is aiming to become the first British sailor to win the race.
Since the first race in 1989, only 71 of 138 starters have completed the voyage, which is known for being one of the most gruelling sporting challenges in the world.
