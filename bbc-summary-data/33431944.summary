[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient considered not well enough to swallow solid food choked to death after he was mistakenly given lunch, Inverness Sheriff Court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James South, 51, from Aviemore, had respiratory problems and was being fed via a tube in an intensive care ward at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness.
The court heard there was a sign above his bed with the words "nil by mouth" written in red pen.
NHS Highland admitted a health and safety breach and was fined Â£40,000.
Mr South was being cared for in ward 11 at the hospital.
The court heard that in error on 6 February Mr South was offered lunch and he chose soup, sausages and ice cream, which he ate himself.
Peter Gray QC, the health board's counsel, told the court that the incident had been an "isolated failure at operational level".
He said: "The failing relates to one ward in one hospital on one day. It is not a systematic failure and the organisation has no previous convictions.
"But it is accepted had the system which was in place been robustly applied on that day, the death would not have occurred. It was not a wilful disregard for patient safety, cutting corners or ignoring staff warnings."
Mr Gray added: "The system had worked up to that day and a meal-time co-ordinator has now been appointed.
"This decision was taken prior to this incident and indicates that health and safety generally was a matter that was always at the forefront of the organisation."
Fining the health board, Sheriff Margaret Neilson said: "The penalty imposed is not meant to measure the value of someone's life.
"A significant financial penalty is appropriate here. A death has occurred due to a public body's failure. But I note that it has taken steps to rectify the failings.
"This was a tragic but isolated incident."
Outside the court, Mr South's mother Sandra South said: "The fine is fair. It is not the money, but the principle which concerned me. James had been doing so well.
"But the human element came into it. I do not bear any grudges and want to say that the care he received in intensive care was wonderful.
"However, I wouldn't like to comment on what I think about ward 11."
In a statement, NHS Highland said it accepted that it failed to have consistently safe systems in place on the day Mr South died.
Dr Rod Harvey, board medical director, said: "On behalf of NHS Highland I firstly want to acknowledge that this has been a tragic incident for the family.
"The systems we had in place were not consistently good enough and had they been more effective this death could have been avoided.
"This is something we deeply regret and for which we apologise unreservedly to the family."
He added: "It is also important to emphasise that we have taken this extremely seriously from the outset. We carried out an immediate investigation, and reported the case to the procurator fiscal and health and safety executive."
