The body of the 36-year-old was discovered on Friday evening in Culver Street, Salisbury.
Officers said "there may be a quantity of contaminated heroin" in the city and have issued an 'urgent warning' to drug users to be aware.
The woman has not been formally identified.
DS Guy Williams, of Salisbury CID, said the batch of drugs could "have the potential to lead to further illness or death".
