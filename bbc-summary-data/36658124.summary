The Open 2016: Colin Montgomerie qualifies for Royal Troon

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colin Montgomerie will play at The Open for the first time since 2010 after qualifying for this year's event on his home course at Royal Troon.

The 53-year-old shot rounds of 66 and 71 to secure one of three places available from final qualifying at Gailes Links, Irvine.
Montgomerie finished third at Gailes behind Oskar Arvidsson of Sweden and Scott Fernandez of Spain.
The Scot made 21 straight Open appearances until 2010 at St Andrews.
Montgomerie, for whom it is likely to be his last chance to play an Open at Troon, finished one stroke ahead of fellow Scot Jack Doherty, who finished on four under after a second-round 70.
Arvidsson, who is ranked 1,418th in the world, finished four strokes ahead of Fernandez after a blistering opening 64, with the Spaniard one ahead of Montgomerie.
Final qualifying for the year's third major - from 14-17 July - was held over four courses and there was drama at Hillside after five players tied for second behind England's Jack Senior.
Compatriots Paul Howard and Dave Coupland qualified after a play-off, with English amateur Steven Robins, Scotland's Jay Taylor and Australia's Scott Arnold missing out.
There was also a play-off at Woborn, where Ireland's Paul Dunne led the field to finish one ahead of England's Ryan Evans on nine-under par.
Robert Rock won a play-off against fellow Englishman Aaron Rai to clinch the third qualifying spot after they tied on seven under.
England's Matthew Southgate led the field by three shots at Royal Cinque Ports, with compatriot James Heath and New Zealand's Steven Alker also qualifying after tying three strokes behind on three under par.
