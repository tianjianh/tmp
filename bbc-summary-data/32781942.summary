Buckinghamshire groomed girl abused by 60 men in 'ring of horror'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of a child sex ring abused two vulnerable schoolgirls on a "massive scale", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One girl, who was aged 12 or 13 at the time, alleges she was abused and passed between 60 men who had sex with her, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.
Eleven men, on trial at the Old Bailey, variously deny 52 sexual offences between 2006 and 2012.
Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC said the girls were conditioned into believing their "horrifying" ordeal was normal.
Both came from troubled backgrounds and wanted to feel grown up when they were taken in by the men.
Charges included the multiple rape of a child under 13, child prostitution and administering a substance to "stupefy" a girl in order to engage in sexual activity.
In all, 45 charges relate to one child, who cannot be identified for legal reasons and is known as "A", and four against a second girl, referred to as "B".
Mr Saxby said: "This case concerns child sexual exploitation on a massive scale.
"It features two young girls who were... sexually abused from the age of 12 or 13.
"Both girls were from unstable backgrounds, making perfect targets.
"Their lives were 'off the rails'. They were looking for excitement, for attention, for somewhere to hang out away from school and home.
"They were wanting to feel grown up and looked after. And they were easy prey for a group of men wanting casual sexual gratification that was easy, regular and readily available."
Mr Saxby said the girls were befriended and given gifts such as alcohol, DVDs, food, and occasionally drugs.
"They were children, they spoke in terms of these men being their boyfriends. And they were passed from man to man - sometimes on a daily basis.
"The scale of it is, you may agree, horrifying. A estimated that she had sex with about 60 men," said Mr Saxby.
The 11 on trial are accused of being among the men who abused the schoolgirls.
At the time they lived in Aylesbury where the alleged abuse occurred and some were friends.
