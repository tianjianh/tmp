Australia, the reigning champions in both competitions, will host the events, with the finals being played back-to-back on 2 December in Brisbane.
Australia, England, Canada, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are already sure of places at the women's tournament.
Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and the Cook Islands will compete for the final place in the Pacific qualifying series in October.
The tournament's CEO, Andrew Hill, said it was a "game-changer" for the sport.
"It has always been the board's vision to have the Women's Rugby League World Cup played concurrently with the men's tournament," he added.
"We have been able to create what is a milestone moment for the sport."
