100 Women 2016: Why women are less likely to ask for a pay rise or promotion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A survey by BBC Radio 5 live has suggested a large majority (83%) of women think that men and women are not always equal in the workplace.

It found that only 52% of women feel they are paid fairly at work compared to 64% of men.
Only a third (32%) of women said they would be confident asking for a pay rise, compared to a more assertive 51% of men.
The findings are part of research carried out by ComRes for Radio 5 live.
Looking at contrasting attitudes between the sexes around their careers and family life in general, Radio 5 live questioned 1,000 women and 1,000 men.
A majority of women (56%) said they would be confident in applying for promotions at work, but that is compared to a much larger percentage of men - 68% - who said they would apply.
The survey also looked at the impact of having a family on a woman's job prospects. Nearly half (47%) of women questioned said that having children had not helped their careers, whereas only 31% of men questioned felt having children had held them back.
A large majority (84%) of women agreed that it was harder for women than men to have a successful career and raise a family.
"Our workplace in Britain is still shaped around a time when work was dominated by men," said Maria Miller, Conservative Member of Parliament MP and Chair of the Women and Equalities Committee.
"We've started a modernisation process with some people being able to work flexibly, the government doubling the amount of free childcare, and the introduction of shared parental leave - getting away from the idea that it's only women that look after children," she told BBC 5 live.
But in spite their views on inequality, only a minority of women categorised themselves as feminist - 48% of women said they do not regard themselves as a feminist, though a quarter of men said they did.
In the poll, younger women were more likely to call themselves feminist than the older generation, but even in the 25-34 year-old category, only 38% said they saw themselves as a feminist.
