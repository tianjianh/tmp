[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Ramsay, 50, stabbed 39-year-old Alan Whitelaw eight times in the neck and arm at his the victim's flat in Maryhill on 1 July 2014.
He claimed the killing was accidental after Mr Whitelaw attacked him but a jury at the High Court in Glasgow unanimously convicted him of murder.
Ramsay faces a mandatory life term when he is sentenced next month.
The court heard that Ramsay and Mr Whitelaw had only met three times.
On the day of the murder, Mr Whitelaw had invited Ramsay to his home for a drink.
After eating a takeaway curry together the two men rowed and Mr Whitelaw attacked Ramsay, leaving him battered and bruised.
Ramsay was dragged away by neighbour who heard the fight. As he left he shouted threats at Mr Whitelaw.
Some hours later, armed with two knives, he went back to Mr Whitelaw's home in Glenfinnan Road and killed him.
Mr Whitelaw's body was discovered by his neighbour, 49-year-old Kevin Lundie.
He went into the flat after seeing blood in the hallway.
He told the court: "It was pitch dark inside the flat. The only thing I could see in the living room was the television, but I could make out the silhouette of his body. I ran out the living room and phoned the emergency services."
In evidence Ramsay claimed he had returned to Mr Whitelaw's home because he had left his keys there.
He told the jury that Mr Whitelaw came at him with two knives and pinned him to the floor and he had to defend himself.
Ramsay was asked by defence QC Donald Findlay: "Did you mean to kill Mr Whitelaw?" and replied: "No I was trying not to hurt him. I just wanted to get him away from me."
Following his conviction, it emerged that Ramsay had a number of previous convictions, including two for assault and robbery.
