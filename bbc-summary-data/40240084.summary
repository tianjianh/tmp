The Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns has kept his job as Welsh Secretary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theresa May reshuffled her cabinet after a general election campaign which saw her party lose its Commons majority.
Mr Cairns, whose re-appointment comes after the party lost three seats in Wales, said he was "delighted".
During the campaign, he and Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies clashed after both declined to take part in a TV election debate.
"I will continue to work closely and constructively with businesses, local authorities, communities as well as the Welsh Government to secure the best possible outcomes for people in Wales," said Mr Cairns.
The Conservatives made a net loss of 13 seats across Great Britain and lost the two seats gained from Labour in Wales at the 2015 election.
Welsh Tory MPs Guto Bebb and David Jones are waiting to hear if they will continue in their Wales Office and Brexit posts respectively.
Meanwhile, Barry-born Damian Green, MP for Ashford, has been promoted to first secretary of state and minister for the cabinet office.
Mrs May said she had appointed "a cabinet that will get on with the job of government".
