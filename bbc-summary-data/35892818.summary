[SN]TITLE[SN]
Deal done to sell two Tata Steel mills in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
International metals firm Liberty House has signed a deal to buy two mothballed steel plants in Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The agreement involves the Scottish Government buying the Clydebridge and Dalzell plants from Tata Steel, and immediately selling them on to Liberty.
The sale will be made under the same terms with no cost to the taxpayer.
Liberty will take responsibility for reopening, operating and investing in the two sites as its attempts to build a sustainable UK steel business.
Confirming the deal on Thursday, business minister Fergus Ewing said: "When Tata Steel mothballed the Dalzell and Clydebridge plants, I said we would leave no stone unturned in the quest to find an alternative buyer.
"That is why we established a Scottish steel taskforce and why I am delighted that our support for the steel industry has paid off."
Tata Steel announced in October it would close both Scottish plants with the loss of 270 jobs.
