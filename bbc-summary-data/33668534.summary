The accident happened in the early hours of Sunday between junctions 15 and 14 on the eastbound carriageway, close to the Membury Services.
Wiltshire Police said the woman who died was a passenger in an Audi A4 which collided with a Vauxhall Zafira.
The Audi driver, a 60-year-old man from south-east London, suffered life-changing injuries.
His back seat passenger, a 59-year-old woman, was seriously injured.
They were taken to Great Western Hospital in Swindon where their condition is said to be "serious but stable".
The Zafira driver, a man from west London who also suffered life-changing injuries, was taken to the John Radcliffe in Oxford for treatment.
"For reasons unknown a Vauxhall Zafira travelling towards London left the carriageway, hit the nearside crash barrier and bounced back into carriageway before coming to rest broadside-on in the middle lane," a police spokesman said.
"As the driver exited his vehicle he was struck by the Audi travelling in lane three.
"The Audi then struck the offside of the Zafira. The impact caused the Zafira to cross the carriageway and come to rest on the nearside verge with the Audi coming to rest against the central reservation."
Anyone who witnessed the accident, which happened just after 02:00 BST, is asked to contact Wiltshire Police.
