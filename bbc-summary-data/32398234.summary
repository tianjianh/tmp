Great Western Hospital's NHS trust must improve, Monitor says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An NHS trust that faces an Â£8.6m overspend has been told it must improve by watchdog Monitor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were licence breaches in patient services, agency staff spending and discharging patients, it said.
The Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, in Wiltshire, said it would improve financial performance, sustainability and governance.
A Monitor spokesman said it recognised the trust could not fix all of these problems on its own.
