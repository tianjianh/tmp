McIlroy has indicated that conflicting loyalties make him uncomfortable with declaring to be part of either a Great Britain or Ireland team for the Games.
The 27-year-old, born in Northern Ireland, opted to represent Ireland, before pulling out of Rio 2016 because of concerns about the Zika virus.
"More likely than not I won't be going to the Games because of my personal feelings." said the world number two.
McIlroy says it is a decision he has not taken lightly, one that "I have fought with myself over for so many years".
"The Olympic Games are fantastic and I think golf's inclusion is fantastic, but for me its something I don't want to get into. That's a personal choice and hopefully people respect that decision.
"It went well in 2016 and I hope it goes even better in 2020 but I probably won't be a part of it.
"If it upsets some people that's ok, I can't please everyone  but as long as I am true to myself I'll be happy."
McIlroy will take part in his first tournament of the season, the South African Open, this week.
