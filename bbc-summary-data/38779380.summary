[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 1-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley made it five wins from their last seven National League games with victory over Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blair Turgott broke the deadlock from the spot with his 10th goal of the season in the 13th minute after David Fitzpatrick handled in the area.
Turgott's strike went in off the post, giving Torquay goalkeeper Brendan Moore no chance, but the visitors were not as fortunate when Brett Williams' 36th-minute drive from close range hit the bar and went over.
The visitors' search for an equaliser was just as fruitless after the break and Bromley are now up to 11th place.
