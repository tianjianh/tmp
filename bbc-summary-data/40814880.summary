The 23-year-old joined the Hatters from West Ham during their Conference-winning season in 2013-14 and follows Justin James in penning a new deal.
"I can't wait to get started again and hopefully we can get promotion this season," Mpanzu said.
"Last year was a bit of a disappointment at the end, but we know we can turn it around."
Luton lost in the League Two play-offs to Blackpool last season and start the new campaign at home against Yeovil Town.
