[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stuart Bannigan has signed a new two-year contract with Partick Thistle less than two weeks after the Glasgow club announced he had exited Firhill.

The midfielder, who had received an approach from Scottish Premiership rivals Inverness Caledonian Thistle, had initially rejected a new deal.
But Thistle have announced that Bannigan has now extended his stay.
The 23-year-old came through the youth ranks at Firhill and played 28 times last season.
Bannigan was one of three Thistle midfielders approached by former Caley Thistle manager John Hughes.
Abdul Osman and Steven Lawless also eventually signed new contracts with the Glasgow club.
