Cafe owner Lisa White, 56, from Broadstairs, claimed she needed an oxygen mask to breathe, and was paid more than Â£150,000 in benefits.
However, investigators obtained undercover footage of her working in the cafe, and a video of her dancing.
She admitted fraud and was jailed at Inner London Crown Court on Thursday.
White told Greenwich Borough Council she was living in a council home in Eltham, south east London, with her mother.
The council raised concerns after irregularities were found in payments to her carer.
Her husband, Andrew White, 56, was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence for his part in the fraud.
Mr White had given his address as being in Broadstairs while caring for his wife, who was living in the council's property in London.
Mrs White had been receiving direct debit payments of Â£135 per week from Greenwich council, but bank statements showed the amounts being paid to her husband and carer were lower, the council said.
She told Greenwich council the Eltham property was her only home, but records showed her name was linked to two properties in Broadstairs as well as a cafe and bandstand kiosk.
A council spokesman said: "She stated that she required care and assistance on a daily basis; that she could not dress herself without assistance; was unable to lift kitchen items such as pots and pans; required the assistance of oxygen tanks to regulate her breathing and had to use a walking stick indoors and a wheelchair outdoors in order to assist her mobility."
Fraud investigators filmed her running her business including serving customers and carrying heavy supplies, visiting a shopping centre, and dancing, the London authority said.
Her husband admitted one charge of fraud and one under the Proceeds of Crime Act.
