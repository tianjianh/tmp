Ted Trim, from Theydon Bois, was declared the winner after final heats in Essex and West Sussex on Saturday.
More than 200 people competed in six-car 10-lap races around a 28ft (8.55m) circuit at the events, but no-one could beat the best time of 2015, set by Ted.
He won with 24.49 seconds. His time was recorded in Harlow in August.
He said he had come across the competition while out shopping and had just decided "to have a go".
"I'm happy and surprised because I'd never played before," Ted said, adding that he would be defending his title next year.
The teenager said he had since bought a Scalextric set.
Other heats during this year were also held elsewhere in the UK and Europe.
The final rounds took place at the English Martyrs Church Hall in Goring-by-Sea, and at Marquee Models in the Harvey Centre, Harlow.
Competitors raced against each other using Maserati Trofeos, a Bentley Continental and a Chevrolet Camaro.
They used the same Scalextric Digital layout as the other championship events and use the same models of Scalextric cars and controllers.
Prizes were awarded for the fastest time each hour and to the overall winner and top under-16 racer of the day.
Local schoolboy Vlad Howe was the winner in Goring-by-Sea, having set the fastest time of the day of 32.53 seconds.
His father said: "I've got boxes of Scalextric in the loft. Maybe it's time to get it down."
In Harlow, the winner of the day was 66-year-old Colin Gill, with the fastest time of 29.3 seconds.
