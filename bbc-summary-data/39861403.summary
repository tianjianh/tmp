Lawro's Premier League predictions v tennis world number one Andy Murray

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is Britain's tennis world number one Andy Murray.
Murray will be in action in the UK next month when he defends his title at the Aegon Championships at the Queen's Club, live on BBC TV, radio and online from 19-25 June.
The 29-year-old has won the tournament a record five times but this time faces competition from the strongest field in the tournament's 127-year history, with five of the world's top seven players present - including Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka and last year's runner-up Milos Raonic.
Murray told BBC Sport: "I love it at Queen's - this is the tournament where I won my first match as a professional on the main tour in 2005.
"I have been coming back for the past 12 years pretty much and have played some of my best tennis here so have always enjoyed playing there.

"There is a lot more of an opportunity to come and watch this year because they have put about 2,000 more seats on the Centre Court, which has increased the capacity by about 30%.
"They have made some big changes on Court One now too - that has moved to a bigger stadium as well, so it will be good for the fans."

Murray is a Hibernian fan and is well known for his keepy-uppy skills with a tennis ball - honed through hours of football practice when he was growing up.
"When I was younger I played a lot, until I was about 15 and decided I was going to give tennis a go," he said.
"Even then I still played five-a-side football whenever I was home - normally at least once a week until I was probably in my early to mid-20s.
"I stopped because I was having problems with my back.
"Now, when I am not playing tennis, I am resting and training for tennis rather than playing football but, when I finish my tennis, I think I will start playing again."
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.

Match report
Crystal Palace v Hull City (12:00 BST)
This is a big one at the bottom of the table but, as bad as Crystal Palace were against Manchester City, it is still very hard to tip Hull to win away.
The Tigers have not managed a league victory on the road since 20 August, when they won at Swansea. Seventeen away trips later, they have picked up only three more points with three draws and, overall, they have the worst away record in the top flight.

Palace have been all over the place defensively recently, and three defeats in a row have put them back in trouble.
A point would do for the Eagles here, though, and that is what I think they will get.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Andy's prediction: These are tough fixtures to predict. Palace to win, with a Christian Benteke brace. 2-0
Match preview
West Ham v Liverpool (14:15 BST)
As I have said, I think Liverpool will need to win their final two games to make the top four - but I am just not convinced they will do it. I don't think they will get three points against West Ham for starters.
If Liverpool do fall short, it will be because of their mentality. They play as if they will always create chances, so can be somewhat wasteful - but that is not the case. There is something missing with their attack at the moment.

I presume Jurgen Klopp will start with Adam Lallana even if he is not 100% fit because there is no point protecting him any longer - they need his help now.
There is also a case for giving Daniel Sturridge a start too. After coming off the bench along with Lallana in the second half against Southampton on Sunday, he was one of the few Liverpool players to look lively in what was a really poor result for the Reds.
West Ham are supposedly one of the teams interested in signing Sturridge in the summer so this is something of a showcase for him - his future is undecided but it does not matter what his motivation is if he gets Liverpool the points.
The key will be whether they can break West Ham down - the Hammers played with three at the back in their win over Tottenham last week and flooded the midfield.
If they do that again, there will not be much space for Liverpool's creative players, which is why I am going for a draw.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Andy's prediction: Another draw, I think! 1-1
Match preview
Tottenham v Man Utd (16:30 BST)
It is Tottenham's final game at White Hart Lane but the occasion should not surprise most of the Manchester United players because they played - and lost - in West Ham's last game at Upton Park at the end of last season too.
I have been saying for a while now that I don't buy Jose Mourinho's comments about the size or strength of his squad, and I don't see United's Europa League campaign as an excuse if they miss out on the top four.

Mourinho said he would rest a lot of players against Arsenal last weekend but when you totalled up starting appearances by both teams, United's players had made 226 more appearances than the Gunners' side - that says it all about his so-called weakened team.
Tottenham's defeat and performance at West Ham was a disappointing end to their title hopes but I think we have seen enough from them this season to expect a response, especially at home where they have won 16 and drawn two of their 18 league games so far.
I always enjoyed going to White Hart Lane as a player, because they would always let you play - I don't recall losing many times there with Liverpool.
One memory that stands out is from a game in the 1980s where Kenny Dalglish got absolutely lumped by Tottenham defender Graham Roberts, who was part centre-half, part assassin.
About 30 seconds later, a certain G. Souness got his revenge on Roberts with a very similar sort of tackle. As was often the case, that was the end of that matter.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Andy's prediction: My coach is a United fan and my physio is a Tottenham fan, so I hear a lot about both of these teams.
Spurs are at home, in the last ever game at White Hart Lane, and with Jose Mourinho involved it is going to be a tight match - I'm going to go for yet another draw. 1-1
Match preview
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 140 points (week 22 v James McAvoy)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
From last weekend's Premier League matches, Lawro got six correct results, including one perfect score, from 10 matches, for a total of 90 points.
He beat Serge Pizzorno from Kasabian, who got three correct results with no perfect scores, but lost out to his band-mate Tom Meighan, who got four correct results, including two perfect scores, for a tally of 100 points.
Lawro also picked up three more points for correctly predicting Arsenal's win over Southampton on Wednesday. Martin Kemp wins no extra points because he picked Saints to win 1-0.
