Two special information sessions are being offered in the Scottish Borders to anyone thinking of standing for election as a councillor.

They will look at what the role involves and the "reality of life" on a local authority.
Returning officer Tracey Logan said being a councillor was "rewarding but also demanding".
The two sessions are at Scottish Borders Council's Newtown St Boswells headquarters on 21 and 28 February.
Local government elections are taking place in Scotland, England and Wales on 4 May this year.
Ms Logan said: "Anyone successfully elected has the privilege of representing their local community and being involved in decisions which can make a difference to people's lives.
"These sessions will offer plenty of information to those considering standing in this year's election, including a chance to hear from current elected members on the realities of being a councillor."
Both events run from 18:00 to 20:30.
