Surrey Police said the 4x4 struck a group of pedestrians in Bridge Street at about 13:30 GMT.
A woman in her 30s was pronounced dead at the scene, officers said. Police have informed her family.
Another pedestrian, a man in his 40s, has suffered serious pelvic injuries and been taken to hospital in London.
Police said a third pedestrian, a woman in her 30s, had minor injuries.
The Land Rover Defender driver, a man in his 40s, has been taken to the Royal Surrey County Hospital with what are thought to be minor injuries.
The road is expected to remain closed for several hours and drivers and pedestrians are being advised to avoid the area.
Matty Wilson, who lives in a flat overlooking the scene, said he could see several police cars blocking the road.
He said the 4x4 had been covered from view and passers-by were standing and watching.
"I could see it was a major accident," he said. "A number of pedestrians were involved."
Mr Wilson said the emergency services were still at the scene at about 16:00 GMT.
BBC reporter Adrian Harms, who is at the scene, said details of what happened remained unclear.
He said the road had been completely sealed off, with traffic around Guildford "largely gridlocked" and the town centre in "chaos", but Bridge Street reopened after 17:00 GMT.
Police remained at the scene and green screen had been erected around the crash site, he added.
