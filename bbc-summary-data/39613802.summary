£50,000 bid to repair Victorian Llanfyllin workhouse roof

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a Victorian workhouse are trying to get funding to repair part of the roof.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former Llanfyllin Union Workhouse in Powys, known locally as Y Dolydd, opened in 1839 and could house up to 250 men, women and children.
Today, it is the only one of its kind in Wales which people can visit and accommodates tourists, hosts activities and has opened up a visitors' centre.
Its octagonal roof in the middle of the site needs £50,000 of repairs.
The Llanfyllin Dolydd Building Preservation Trust also eventually wants to restore the master's house to include a new entrance, lift and toilets at a cost of £100,000.
