Olympic champion Adam Peaty and his Rio medal-winning team-mates will bid to reach the 2017 World Championships when they compete in Sheffield this week.

Peaty - Britain's first male Olympic swimming gold medallist for 28 years - begins his campaign on Tuesday, the opening day of the GB Championships.
Fellow individual Rio medal winners Jazz Carlin and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor will also race in the six-day event.
"I've been training well and I'm ready to swim fast again," said Peaty.
The 22-year-old, who moved with coach Mel Marshall from City of Derby to Loughborough after the Rio Games, has decided against adding the 200m breaststroke event to his schedule this year.
He will instead focus on qualifying for July's World Championships in Budapest in the 50m and 100m - both titles he claimed at the 2015 Worlds in Kazan, Russia.
"People say you have got to defend your titles, but I don't see it like that," he said.
"I am still attacking those titles - every single one - because I am planning to go faster than anyone else."
Carlin, 26, who claimed 400m and 800m freestyle silver medals in Rio behind American Katie Ledecky, considered retirement after the Games but believes she can still make improvements.
"I still have more things that I want to do, more things I want to achieve," she said.
"In Rio it was good to see all of the work pay off, but I'm still finding those small things that can make a big difference and help me go faster."
Carlin will be joined by Olympic team-mate James Guy at her base in Bath for the next Olympic cycle, with the 2015 world champion relocating from his long-term base at Millfield School in Somerset.
Guy, who won silver medals as part of the 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley relay teams in Rio, is keen to put the disappointment of missing out on individual honours behind him.
"The move is exactly what I needed, as it's a professional environment that will help me develop," said the 21-year-old, who is adding the 200m butterfly to a busy schedule that includes the 100m event and both the 200m and 400m freestyle distances.
"Now I have that Kazan mindset back and I want to be the best in the world again."
With seasoned international swimmers like Fran Halsall, Michael Jamieson, Keri-Anne Payne and Roberto Pavoni all retiring in recent months, the British Championships will also serve as an opportunity for rising stars to establish themselves as part of the GB team as they build towards the next Olympics in Tokyo 2020.
