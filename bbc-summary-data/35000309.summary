Famous singer Lionel Richie will be the guest mentor this week, and popstars Sia and Jason Derulo will also be performing.
But, whoever wins will be joining a long line of X Factor singers, here is how the previous winners have got on since winning the show...
Last year's winner Ben Haenow beat Fleur East, and grabbed a Christmas number one with his X Factor debut single, 'Something I Need'.
He's now signed to Simon Cowell's record label Syco, and has recently released his debut album, which even has a duet with famous singer Kelly Clarkson on it.
Sam Bailey managed to score the first X Factor Christmas number one in three years with her single 'Skyscraper' in 2013, as well as giving birth to her daughter.
She has also supported her idol, pop superstar Beyonce, on one of her UK tour dates for her 'Mrs Carter World Tour' in 2014, and performed in a West End show.
James' debut single 'Impossible' became the fastest selling X Factor single of any X Factor winner, and sold over one million copies.
The singer has left Simon Cowell's record label and is currently working on his second album.
He's performed at V Festival and successfully toured the UK this year.
Little Mix were a group of singers who came together on the show to become the first band to win the competition.
Since winning the show they have sold more than five million singles and scooped a fair few awards.
They were the first girl band since The Pussycat Dolls to reach the top five in America with their album. Their new single 'Black Magic' has placed at number 68 in the Billboard Hot 100 Charts in America - That's their highest chart position in the US.
Matt Cardle beat pop mega-group One Direction to take the series seven crown back in 2010.
Matt is currently recording his fourth album which is expected to be released later this year and also starred in a hit musical called Memphis.
Joe McElderry won the X Factor after appearing on the show for the second time in 2009 beating Olly Murs, who now presents the show.
Joe went on to make four albums, and went on to became a reality TV star by winning the shows 'Popstar to Operastar' and 'The Jump'.
He has even been praised by the Queen after he performed for her at the Royal Albert Hall.
Alexandra Burke won the show in 2008 - she had previously auditioned back in 2005 but wasn't picked by Louis Walsh for his final four.
Since then Alexandra has released two albums and is currently starring in the musical 'The Bodyguard'.
She also appeared on the X Factor again as a guest judge, in 2011.
2007's winner Leon was dropped by his record label after just one album.
He became the star of his own web series called Leon's Life which ran until 2008, Leon still performs across the UK and continues to write music.
Leona Lewis is one of the X Factor's most successful artists after selling more than 20 million records worldwide and being nominated for numerous music awards.
Her first single 'A Moment Like This', made it to Christmas number one selling more copies than the rest of that week's top 40 combined.
Since then she's had loads of hit singles and albums, recorded the theme song for the film Avatar and even gone on two world tours.
After releasing four albums Shayne appeared in a West End play called 'Rock of Ages' before being a contestant on ITV's Dancing On Ice show.
Earlier this year he signed a one year contract with the television programme, Coronation Street, to play Michelle Connor's cousin Aidan.
Steve Brookstein was the first ever winner of the X Factor when the programme began way back in 2004.
His first single 'Against All Odds' went straight to number one.
However Steve was dropped by his record label eight months after winning the show, due to a fall out with judge Simon Cowell.
