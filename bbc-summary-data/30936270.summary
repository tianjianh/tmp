All-rounder Kleinveldt, 31, almost joined Northants in each of the past two seasons, but the deals fell though.
He has played Tests, one-dayers and T20 for South Africa, but has not featured at international level since 2013.
Batsman Levi, 27, who has appeared in 13 T20 internationals, has signed up for his third consecutive season at Wantage Road.
Kleinveldt will be the county's overseas player, while Levi, who has a first-class average of 39.14, is a Kolpak signing.
"It will be a great boost to know we will have two international players available to us for the whole season," said head coach David Ripley.
"We are excited about Richard establishing himself in the four-day team as well as having his firepower in our one-day team.
"Rory will be a terrific bowler in English conditions. He has just featured in the South African side against the Lions, where he was among the wickets on a pretty flat pitch.
"We look forward to managing his workload over the season to get the best out of him."
