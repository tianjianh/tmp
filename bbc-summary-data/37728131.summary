Plans for an 8,000-seater sports stadium have suffered a setback after a judge gave permission for a cinema chain to mount a legal challenge.

Vue Cinemas will contest City of York Council's decision to approve plans for a larger cinema at the York Community Stadium site than originally agreed, according to the York Press.
The council initially approved a 12-screen design but later gave permission for a 13th screen and 400 extra seats.
The BBC has asked Vue for a statement.

Confirming the application for judicial review had been granted, a council spokeswoman said it expected the hearing to take place in early 2017 but was unable to provide further details.
She said despite the legal challenge the authority was "fully committed to delivering the Community Stadium and Leisure Facility project".
The 12-screen Vue cinema at the Clifton Moor Centre is one of three cinemas in York.
The additional screen and extra seating at the Monks Cross stadium site were approved in June.
According to a council report "given the directly comparable format of the new proposal at Monks Cross, the greatest impact is likely to be felt at Vue".
The stadium development has suffered a number of delays since it was first proposed in 2009.
It was originally forecast to cost Â£37m and open in Spring 2017 but is now expected to cost an additional Â£7m and will not be operational until 2018.
The stadium is due to become home to York City Football Club and York City Knights Rugby League Club.
