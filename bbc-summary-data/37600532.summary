The woman, aged in her 20s, was walking along High Road in Tottenham, north London, with a friend when they were approached from behind by two males.
The victim was not injured but  shocked and distressed, the Met said.
Police are appealing for witnesses and information into the attack on September 28.
One of the males pulled down the victim's hijab before both suspects made off in the direction of Pelham Road.
The first suspect is described as a white man, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, with blond or ginger shaved hair and stubble.
The most visible form of hjab is the head covering that many Muslim women wear but it can go further. Hijab refers to the complete covering of everything except the hands, face and feet in long, loose and non see-through garments.
He was approximately 5ft 6in and  wearing a burgundy coloured hooded top.
The second suspect is described as a man of Mediterranean appearance, aged in his late 20s or early 30s, clean shaven with spiky hair. He was wearing a grey hooded top.
Det Con Ben Cousin said: "This was a shocking attack in broad daylight in the middle of a busy street."
It comes ahead of National Hate Crime Awareness week on Monday, which will see police officers from across London talking to communities about concerns around hate crime.
In the past 12 months, the Met has recorded a rise in nearly all areas of hate crime.
Islamophobic attacks have seen the second largest increase, up 65% in the last year with a spate of religiously aggravated attacks on members of the public - many of whom were targeted on the presumption they were Muslim due to the clothes they were wearing.
