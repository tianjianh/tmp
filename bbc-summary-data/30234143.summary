The legacy of a physician who gave Oxford some of its landmark buildings is being explored in a new exhibition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Radcliffe left the bulk of his fortune to charitable causes on his death 300 years ago in 1714.
This funded the Radcliffe Camera, which was Britain's first circular library, the Radcliffe Observatory and the Radcliffe Infirmary.
Remembering Radcliffe: 300 years of science and philanthropy is at the Bodleian Library until March.
"This is a wonderful opportunity for people to learn more about this remarkable physician and philanthropist," said librarian Richard Ovenden.
"John Radcliffe's legacy lives on today - not only in Oxford's stunning buildings but through his legacy's investment in scientific research and its support for UK heritage and crafts and classical music performance and composition through the Radcliffe Trust."
The exhibition, which is free to attend, includes engravings, watercolours and architectural drawings.
Highlights include a 3D scale model of the Radcliffe Camera from 1735, rare and first edition books from the first collection of books housed in the Radcliffe Camera and items from Radcliffe's medical career.
"The exhibition explains how an 18th Century doctor became one of Oxford's greatest benefactors," said curator Stephen Hebron.
"Visitors can discover the story behind one of Oxford's most famous buildings, the Radcliffe Camera, including its origins, its design, how it was built, and its role as a university library."
