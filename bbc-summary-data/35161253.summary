The 22-year-old Wales international has not played since injuring a hamstring while scoring a hat-trick for Wales in the 54-9 win over Uruguay during the Rugby World Cup on 20 September.
"He's making really good progress," said Head Coach Danny Wilson.
"The next couple of games Cory should be available for some rugby."
If Allen does not make the visit to Rodney Parade, he could be fit for the visit of the Scarlets on New Year's Day.
It is a prospect that pleases Wilson, whose side were beaten by an added time try in Montpellier on Saturday.
"That's great for me, it'll be the first time I've worked with him in this environment as a Cardiff Blues player so I'm looking forward to again someone like him returning to the fold," said Wilson.
"We're slowly moving forward.
"Coming out of the last four games we've had a narrow defeat to the Ospreys, beaten Connacht at home, beaten Montpellier at home with five tries and just with the last play of the game losing to Montpellier away.
"I think they're performances that do show progress, but we're still fully aware we've got a long way to go."
