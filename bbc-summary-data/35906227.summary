The memorial event at Whitecrook Park in the town was arranged on social media by friends of the 15-year-old who was found dead on Monday.
She was last seen alive near a deli in Clydebank on Saturday 19 March after she had set off for her part-time job at a hairdressers.
A man has appeared in court charged with her murder.
About 300 people braved wind and rain to assemble at the park, many of them carrying pink balloons in tribute to Paige.
Some of the teenager's friends addressed the crowd to thank them for attending in memory of a "most outstanding, amazing girl".
One girl said: "Paige was so beautiful, everything about her you just wouldn't change. For that to get taken away from us was absolutely heart-breaking."
Another added: "I just can't believe she has gone, it hasn't sunk in. There's only one star in the sky tonight and it's obviously Paige looking down on us."
A minute's silence was held before people lit candles and tied pink balloons to railings.
Some of those gathered played songs and held up posters dedicated to Paige.
On Thursday, the landmark Titan Crane in Clydebank was illuminated in pink in memory of the teenager.
At a private hearing at Dumbarton Sheriff Court on Saturday, John Leathem made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
