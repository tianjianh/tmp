Suarez was in scintillating form during the 3-1 Champions League win against Paris St-Germain on Wednesday, and it took him less than a minute to make his mark as Barca turned their attentions back to La Liga.
Sergio Busquets released Messi, who surged forward before finding former Liverpool striker Suarez, who slid home a low shot for his 11th league goal of the season.
Fourth-placed Valencia were given the chance to level from the spot after Gerard Pique's clumsy challenge on Spain striker Rodrigo, but Bravo dived to his right to keep out Parejo's penalty.
Striker Paco Alcacer found space in the Barcelona box and his shot beat Bravo but came back off the upright as Valencia pressed for a leveller.
Pedro had the chance to seal victory but fired into the side-netting after another fine pass from Messi, but the Argentina forward had the final say.
A Valencia attack broke down, allowing Messi through on goal on the break. Alves saved his initial effort but Messi prodded in the rebound to score in his 471st appearance for the club.
Defeat means Valencia are now four points behind third-placed Atletico Madrid.
