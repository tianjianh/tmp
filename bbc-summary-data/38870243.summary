Wenger has been Gunners boss since October 1996 and has won the Premier League three times, but the 67-year-old's contract expires in the summer.
Arsenal, who last won the league title in 2004, lost 3-1 to league leaders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday to fall 12 points behind the Blues.
"Does he still have the stomach to do this again?" asked Wright.
"It is a tough couple of months for Arsene Wenger, and Arsenal are doing what they do when they slip up," added the Match of the Day pundit, who was part of Arsenal's Premier League-winning squad in 1997-98.
"Arsenal are in the top four, but they aren't winning the league.
"Arsene Wenger has some really serious thinking to do at the end of the season."
Former England defender Martin Keown was part of Wenger's side in each of his three top-flight title wins and he believes the Frenchman will stay on at Arsenal.
Keown told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme: "The way that they are sort of losing their way now, the question comes again - does Arsene Wenger remain in the seat? Do they look to make a change?
"I just feel the way the club is so pragmatic in its decision making, I don't see Arsene leaving. Whether he should or shouldn't, I don't think it will happen."
He added: "He will decide when he leaves the club. I do feel that is the situation and I do feel he has earned the right, in the same way that Sir Alex Ferguson did at Manchester United, to choose when he goes.
"I feel deep down he has already made his mind up to stay. It is just the timing of that announcement. Results like against Chelsea make that difficult for him to do.
"He doesn't make spur of the moment decisions. He has to make the best decision for Arsenal and not just for himself."
Wenger watched Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge from the stand as part of a four-match touchline ban.
He saw his side go behind to a Marcos Alonso header, before Eden Hazard's solo run and finish doubled the Chelsea lead.
An Olivier Giroud headed consolation came after former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas lobbed Petr Cech.
Arsenal are third in the table, a point clear of both Liverpool, who lost at Hull on Saturday, and Manchester City, who host Swansea on Sunday (13:30 GMT).
The Gunners have finished fourth in six of the past 11 seasons and former England defender Danny Mills believes they have "settled for fourth again".
"Chelsea were just so much better all over the pitch physically, mentally," said Mills on BBC Radio 5 live.
"That mentality has to filter down from the top," he added, referring to Wenger.
"It has nothing to do with him being in the stands. He's told them 30 seconds before they go out on to the pitch.
"They were weak mentally and physically. Hazard brushed away three or four Arsenal defenders on his way to scoring."
Wenger was not happy with Alonso's goal, with the Spaniard's arm making contact with Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin's head as he jumped to meet the ball.
"Of course it was a foul," said Wenger. "Referees are much more severe with tackles on the ground and let much more go with elbows in the face. It's not only today, but in many, many games I see.
"But it's more dangerous to hit the head than the legs."
However, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte countered: "To hear this in England, I'm surprised. I must be honest. In England, in this league, this is always a goal.
"It was a contest and Alonso jumped more than Bellerin and scored a goal."
