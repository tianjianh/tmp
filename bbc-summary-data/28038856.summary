[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three airmen died in the incident involving two Tornado GR4s flown out of RAF Lossiemouth in Moray.
BBC Scotland understands that an agreement has been reached between the Crown Office and the MoD to permit publication of the crash investigation.
The Military Aviation Authority carried out the probe.
BBC Scotland understands the report could be published next week, which will see the second anniversary of the crash which happened on 3 July 2012.
The MoD said the report was due to be published "very soon".
A spokeswoman added that the MoD was unable to comment on the contents of the report until after it was published.
The Military Aviation Authority has provided a report on the incident to the procurator fiscal.
The Crown Office has not yet made a decision on whether a fatal accident inquiry will be held.
Moray SNP MP Angus Robertson said the report was overdue.
"Nearly two years have passed since the tragic collision of the two Tornado aircraft over the Moray Firth and there is public interest in the finding being released before any announcement about a fatal accident inquiry," he said.
Bangor-born Flt Lt Hywel Poole, 28, Sqn Ldr Samuel Bailey, 36, from Nottingham, and Flt Lt Adam Sanders, 27, who grew up in Lancashire, died.
Sqd Ldr Paul Evans, from RAF Lossiemouth, survived but was badly injured.
