[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior managers at Manchester City Council could receive above-inflationary pay rises if plans are approved on Thursday.

The head of city centre regeneration is set to receive the largest increase of 20%, leading to a salary of £75,000.
A council document said it reflected "increased responsibility" due to "additional city centre development".
But, the Taxpayers' Alliance said people wanted to see lower council tax rates, not large pay rises for bosses.
Councillor John Flanagan said the rises affected eight posts and would be funded "from within existing budgets".
Seven other senior bosses could earn a pay rise of about 7%.
Despite the disappointing performance of Manchester's schools over recent years, the strategic director of education and skills will get a pay rise of 7.6%.
That will take their new salary to £125,000 per year.
As for other council staff, there are around 1,300 employees who are paid the living wage of £8.25 per hour - and the average council salary is £23,000 a year.
In addition to that, most city council employees were given a pay rise of just 1% earlier this year.
The council have had to cope with huge cuts worth around £300m a year over the past six years.
That has meant a reduction in staff from around 10,000 - to fewer than 6,000 today.
Mr Flanagan, executive member for finance, said: "It is essential that we can keep and attract the right calibre of senior staff by having salaries which reflect the levels of responsibility they have and are in line with those available in comparable cities.
"We are currently reviewing all staff salaries, from top to bottom, to ensure they fairly reflect their workloads and responsibility, while maintaining value for money for council taxpayers."
Harry Davis, from the Taxpayers' Alliance, said the council had been "really good over the last half decade" over pay issues.
"They have removed about 400 staff earning over £50,000," he said.
"But, when savings need to be made and council tax is still going up, they have to make sure that they keep a tight grip on the purse strings so that they can channel as much as possible to front line services and tax cuts for local residents."
