Targets for accident and emergency waiting times were missed in February, with ministers saying departments have been "busier than ever" this winter.

Its target states 95% of patients should spend less than four hours in A&E before being transferred or discharged.
But it achieved 77.2%, which was down from the 78.5% figure for January.
An average of 2,689 people attended Wales' emergency departments each day in February - 112 cases per hour.
The Welsh Government said this was the highest number of attendances at A&E departments in February since records began in 2006.
The figures were significantly lower compared to last February, when 83.7% of cases spent less than 4 hours in A&E.
A spokesman for the Welsh NHS Confederation said: "There is no doubt that emergency healthcare services across Wales have been extremely busy in recent weeks. Staff are continuing to work hard to meet this demand and it is important that we recognise these efforts.
"It is also important that we do not look at A&E in isolation. The pressures on emergency services are indicative of pressures across the whole of the NHS and social care."
