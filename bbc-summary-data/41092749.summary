Sharjeel Khan: Pakistan batsman banned for five years after spot-fixing inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pakistan batsman Sharjeel Khan has been banned for five years for his part in a spot-fixing ring.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) tribunal handed down the punishment following a hearing on Wednesday, but two and a half years of the ban is suspended.
The PCB has been conducting a long-running investigation into corruption in the Twenty20 Pakistan Super League.
Sharjeel, 28, has played one Test match, 25 one-day internationals and 15 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan.
He will not be able to play domestic or international cricket for the next two and a half years, after which his return will be closely monitored, the tribunal said.
The full findings will be released at a later date.
Spot-fixing is where the outcome of a particular passage of play is pre-determined, as opposed to fixing the outcome of a match.
All-rounder Mohammad Nawaz and seamer Mohammad Irfan have already been sanctioned as part of the inquiry after they failed to report suspicious approaches.
A number of other players have also been questioned or suspended while the inquiry is carried out.
Britain's National Crime Agency provided the initial intelligence that led to the PCB investigation.
