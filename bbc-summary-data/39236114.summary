Addressing the Scottish Lib Dem conference in Perth, he also said: "These are dark times for liberalism on both sides of the Atlantic, there are huge convulsions going on in the developed democratic world, but the thing we must be aware of more than anything else is despair and defeatism.
"We hold our own fate much more in our hands than people sometime allow.
"So, self belief is essential for the next tough chapter in our political journey, but it is a politics journey we should undertake knowing that we have good liberal friends across Europe."
