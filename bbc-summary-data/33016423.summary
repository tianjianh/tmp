[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mohammed Rehman, 24, from Reading and Sana Ahmed Khan, 23, from Wokingham, were arrested last Thursday in a "pre-planned operation", police said.
Officers said the pair were arrested to "safeguard public safety" but added that they did not pose any imminent threat to the UK.
They will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday.
Mr Rehman also faces a charge of possessing articles for terrorist purposes.
Police said they were arrested by officers from the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit in a joint operation with the South East Counter Terrorism Unit.
"The arrests were intelligence-led and made to safeguard public safety," West Midlands Police said in a statement.
"However, the action taken was pre-planned and police assess that the pair did not pose any imminent threat to the UK.
"Following the arrests, their home addresses were searched and a number of items were removed for forensic examination."
