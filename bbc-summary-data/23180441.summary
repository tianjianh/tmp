And the Blackburn Rovers and Scotland forward is determined to make an impact at Tannadice.
Goodwillie, 24, scored 40 goals in 136 games for United before moving to Ewood Park in a Â£2m switch in August 2011.
"I hope to string together a few good performances for the team.  I hope we have good results," he said.
Goodwillie, who is under contract at Ewood Park until 2015, made just 10 starts for Rovers last season and endured an unhappy loan stint at Crystal Palace.
However, the forward is unfazed by his lack of football in the past six months.
I'm only 24 and don't think I'll be retiring soon
"You never really forget what you do on the pitch," he said.
"(I want) to play as many games as possible and stay fit. I hope we have good results; it's not all about me.
"It feels really good. It's my second day (back at United), everyone has been really nice and I hope it continues."
Goodwillie said he had unfinished business in England, with two years remaining on his contract at Blackburn.
"I'm only 24 and don't think I'll be retiring soon," he said. "Blackburn hope I'm going to get as many games as possible and show what I can do."
Dundee United boss Jackie McNamara has no concerns over Goodwillie's fitness.
"Seeing him in training yesterday he's very fit," said the United boss. "He's hungry to do well for us and get himself back playing football.
"He's had some turmoil with different managers in the last couple of season and it's very difficult for anyone to go down to another country and the manager who signed you is then away."
McNamara remains keen to add to his squad at Tannadice, adding: "we're still working on things just now to bolster the squad.
"I'm confident we've still got more to add."
