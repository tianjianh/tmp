The LinksAir plane, which had two crew members and one passenger on board, was flying to the airport in South Yorkshire from Belfast City Airport.
The passenger was taken to hospital for checks after the incident on Friday at 19:30 BST, the airport said.
It said the Jetstream 31 aircraft was "currently being moved from the runway area".
Investigations by the UK Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) are concluding at the site and the airport expects to reopen later.
In a statement, a spokesperson said: "Passengers are now checking in as normal and we are working towards the runway being reopened by mid-afternoon.
"We apologise to all passengers for the inconvenience caused."
The airport earlier said passengers who were due to fly on Saturday morning would probably have to leave from other airports and had urged them to speak to their airlines before travelling.
Bobby Fett, 39, from Newcastle upon Tyne, was at the airport on board a plane due to depart for Romania at the time of the Belfast flight's arrival.
He and fellow passengers were told by the pilot there was a "problem on the runway".
"The crash happened as I was sat on the plane about to depart," he said.
"I was sat at the rear on my aircraft and was informed by the pilot that there was a problem on the runway.
"When I looked out I saw what looked to be a small aircraft with its right wing down on the floor. It was obvious it had an undercarriage problem by the way it was sat."
Four inbound scheduled flights and three outbound services were affected on Friday evening, the airport said.
A further three outbound flights were expected to be diverted on Saturday morning.
