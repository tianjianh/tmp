Rachel Parish produced the only individual gold of the final day, as she won the women's double trap event.
Matt Coward-Holley pipped Kneale for the men's double trap bronze, with the results also securing the team gold.
Parish, a 2006 Commonwealth gold medallist, and Coward-Holley's results meant gold for the mixed team.
"The medals in individual and team events demonstrates the strength in depth we are developing across the system and gives us great momentum heading into the Olympic Games in Rio," British Shooting performance director Steven Seligmann said.
