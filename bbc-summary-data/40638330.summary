The Inter Milan winger has been linked with a £48m switch to Old Trafford.
United representatives have visited Milan in an effort to negotiate a deal, but the 28-year-old will be in the Inter squad when they leave for their Far East tour on Tuesday.
Asked for an update after United's 2-1 win over Real Salt Lake, Mourinho said: "No idea. No idea my friend. No idea."
There are some suggestions Inter wanted to include 21-year-old France forward Anthony Martial as part of the deal.
Perisic has been named in the Inter squad to travel to Shanghai, China.
They have matches against French side Lyon and German champions Bayern Munich before facing Premier League champions Chelsea in Singapore on 29 July.
