Silva, 23, scored for Bolton as they came from 2-0 down in the final 10 minutes to earn a point at Wolves.
Bolton are bottom of the Championship table and are winless on their travels in the league so far this season.
"I believe our team play good in a very difficult league. We have good players and I believe in them," he said.
The Arsenal loanee believes Bolton can move up the league given the capability of their squad but stressed the importance of winning their next match at home to Rotherham.
The Trotters are £172.9m in debt, owe HM Revenue & Customs £2.2m and are currently under a transfer embargo.
"We need to work hard to enjoy the game and pass with confidence because we have a good team and I think in the league we can be better in the table," he added.
"We know the [Rotherham] game is very important. Our team need to believe so we can play good, win and take the three points home."
