[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Maddison's loan deal from Norwich City to Aberdeen is to be extended until the end of the season.

The Dons have been told by the English Championship club that they are happy for the 20-year-old midfielder to remain at Pittodrie.
Maddison has made 19 appearances for the Scottish Premiership side, scoring twice.
He has started 13 times since arriving in August as Derek McInnes' side sit third behind Celtic and Rangers.
Maddison started his career with Coventry City and had a previous loan spell back at Ricoh Arena after being sold to Norwich in February.
Canaries manager Alex Neil has decided not to bring the midfielder into his first-team squad despite a disappointing run of eight defeats in 12 games during which the Scot's side have slipped to 12th in the table.
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes suggests he will only add to his own squad during the January transfer window if players leave Pittodrie.
"It's a natural chain of events that, when players here aren't playing regularly, they might be of interest to other clubs," he said.
"And, likewise with ourselves - we'll look to get one or two things done ourselves.
"But I'm really happy with the squad I've got. It's a tight squad, but as we sit at the minute, we have a fully-fit squad to chose from, which is testament to the way the squad works and the medical staff we have.
"All being well, we have a squad already which should see us through to the end of the season.
"But the January window is an opportunity to see what's out there and, if we feel there is a player out there who can help our cause, we will maybe look to do something.
"That, though, will be offset by one or two players looking to get regular football elsewhere."
Aberdeen travel to face fourth-placed Hearts on Friday in their last fixture before the Premiership's three-week January winter break.
"The players will be given a week off - it's some time to spend with their families and some time to switch off mentally," said McInnes.
"The physical part of it will be important for a few of them too. A few need it more than others, but it's an opportunity to do it.
"For the last three seasons, we've had early starts with the Europa League and we've not had the normal summer break that other teams have had.
"So I think any opportunity to give a few days break to certain players is always welcome."
