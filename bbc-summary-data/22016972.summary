Ministers announced more than £2m in the latest round of funding as part of a programme to modernise libraries, archives and museums.
The libraries to benefit are Canton in Cardiff, Cwmbran, Morriston in Swansea, Bridgend, Newtown and Haverfordwest.
They will share around £1m of capital funding to modernise their ageing facilities.
Another £1m will be spent on measures to encourage more public involvement in museums, libraries and archive services across Wales, as well as projects to put archive material online.
Wrexham Library Service will be given £230,000 to co-ordinate all-Wales campaigns and activities to boost community interest in the services.
Culture and Sport Minister John Griffiths said: "Our museums, archives and libraries provide free or low cost access to a wealth of resources and activities that can make a real difference in improving people's lives, especially families on low incomes.
"These grants will create modern, dynamic cultural and educational hubs in our communities for all to enjoy."
The Welsh government said the funding takes the number of sites that have benefitted from its Community Learning Libraries Programme to 89.
However, it comes at a time when library services in some parts of Wales are under threat from cutbacks by local councils.
