Macclesfield Town 0-2 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood beat high-flying Macclesfield at Moss Rose to push into the top half of the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All afternoon it was Scott Flinders in the home goal who was the busier. However Kingsley James also went close for the Silkmen with a shot that whistled just wide.
It was clear that Macclesfield, despite their good recent form, were failing to impose themselves. They were punished midway through the second half when Boreham Wood were awarded a penalty and Kenny Davis slotted home.
Danny Woodards headed in from a late corner to seal the victory.
