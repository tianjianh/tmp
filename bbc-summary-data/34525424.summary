UK trading was "robust", with like-for-like sales in the three months to 27 September up 14.9% to £200m.
The group, which has more than 800 stores in the UK, said sales were boosted by its online channels, particularly the mobile app.
Online sales were 35% higher in the quarter compared with a year earlier.
It added that more than 75% of sales in the year to date were online, and more than half of these sales had come through its mobile app.
Chief executive David Wild said: "We are delighted by this performance as our UK business goes from strength to strength.
"It represents the eighth consecutive quarter of double digit like-for-like sales growth."
The strong trading update sent shares in Domino's up 12.58% to £10.20.
Domino's also said its sponsorship of the television show Hollyoaks had helped to drive revenues, and "the relatively poor weather in the summer months" had also lifted sales.
Domino's opened 12 new stores in the UK during the quarter, bringing the total opened this year to 33. It said it remained on course open a minimum of 50 stores in the UK during 2015.
Domino's Pizza also operates in Ireland, Germany and Switzerland. It said it was encouraged by its results in Ireland, where sales increased by nearly 14% to €13.8m (£10.3m). Sales in Germany rose 14% and they were 5% higher in Switzerland.
