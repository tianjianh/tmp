[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 1-4 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby's hopes of beating the drop suffered a massive setback as they were thrashed at home by Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Solihull broke the deadlock when goalkeeper Rory Watson pushed a 40th-minute shot from Omari Sterling-James against the post and Simeon Maye was on hand to tap in from close range.
Three minutes later, North Ferriby were level when a corner was cleared to the edge of the box to Robbie Tinkler, who fired home.
However, Solihull went back in front in the 63rd minute when Sterling-James got on the end of a through-ball and, despite being fouled, kept his composure to beat Watson for his eighth goal of the season.
The visitors made the points safe in the 76th minute when Ashley Sammons delivered a great free-kick for George Carline to score with a bullet header and Nortey Nortei wrapped up the scoring in stoppage time after good work from fellow sub Regan Charles-Cook.
