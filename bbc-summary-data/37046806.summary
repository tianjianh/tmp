The Judicial Conduct Investigations Office (JCIO) is investigating.
A spokesman said it had received complaints.

After news of her four-letter retort circulated, some people took to social media to praise her reaction and choice of words, branding her a "hero" and an "idol".
Hennigan was jailed for 18 months for insulting and making racist slurs against a black woman in Harlow, Essex.
