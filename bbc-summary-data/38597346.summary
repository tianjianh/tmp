[SN]TITLE[SN]
Danny Hylton: Luton Town striker signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luton Town striker Danny Hylton has signed a new contract to stay with the League Two club until June 2019.

Hylton joined Luton on a two-year deal in May 2016 after rejecting a new contract at Oxford United.
The 27-year-old is the Hatters' top scorer this season, with 14 goals in 26 games in all competitions.
"This is a big signing for us and it's like a new one really because it secures him for us long-term," manager Nathan Jones told the club website.
"We got him in the summer and he's been a revelation, not only on the pitch but off it too with the way he is around the place."
