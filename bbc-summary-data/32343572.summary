Officers say the 16-year-old girl was walking home in Kilmarnock with the three men when one of the men attacked her.
Following the assault, the man joined the other two men who were walking towards the town centre.
Det Insp Stevie Wallace described the incident as "a horrendous ordeal for a young woman".
Police Scotland said the attack took place at about 02:00 on Saturday, in the archway close to John Finnie Street and Nelson Street, after the girl and the three men had been walking along Nelson Street.
The teenager reported the incident to police a few days later.
The three men police want to identify are all white, in their early 20s and of medium height and build. They speak with local accents and have brown hair.
The suspect was wearing a black jumper with the sleeves pulled up to his forearms, dark blue jeans and brown shoes or boots.
A second man was wearing a distinctive blue hooded sweatshirt which had 'Jack and Jones 1975' written on it.
He was also wearing blue jeans and white trainers.
The third man police want to identify was wearing a distinctive red and blue hooped T-shirt with blue jeans.
Det Insp Stevie Wallace, of Kilmarnock CID, said: "This was a horrendous ordeal for a young woman to have to experience and it is critical that we trace this man as soon as possible.
"I would like to reassure the community that our officers are doing everything they can to find the person responsible. Incidents like this are extremely rare in our town.
"However we need help from members of the public who may have vital information to assist with the investigation.
"I ask that anyone who might recognise the suspect description or the other two men gets in touch with any information.
"It's possible they may have been out and about in Kilmarnock town centre earlier on in the night, hailed a taxi on John Finnie Street on their way home or attended at fast food takeaway shops later in the evening.
"I would also urge anyone who was in the surrounding area around that time who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact police.
"Officers are currently at the scene. Available CCTV is being analysed and we are also conducting door-to-door inquiries in the area. Extra patrols will be present in the area during the inquiry."
