About 200 athletes and up to 25,000 amateur runners will race 13.1 miles (21km) in the IAAF Cardiff University World Half Marathon on 26 March.
The "500 club" runners have been recruited for research on whether they continue to exercise after the race.
The study will also look at what motivates them to run or stop.
Dr Liba Sheeran, leading the research, said her team would also collect data on race finish times and whether there were differences in the perceptions of those who finished and those who did not.
"Knowing what motivates people to run in the half marathon and participate in regular exercise before and after the race - and what can be done to help them to continue to run - would be very useful for future mass race event organisation," she said.
The runners will be given advice on injury prevention during the study.
The route will start outside Cardiff Castle and finish on King Edward VII Avenue in the city centre.
