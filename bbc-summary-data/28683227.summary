The resort will be closed for the event of 4-5 September and over 12 miles (20 km) of security fencing is already being put up on-site and in Cardiff.
About 9,000 officers from 29 forces in England and Wales are being drafted in to police the summit.
Senior officers say they expect some protest groups to hold demonstrations.
US President Barack Obama will be among the world leaders attending.
Assistant Chief Constable of Merseyside Police Chris Armitt, who is leading the policing and security operation for the summit, said: "We are also working hard to ensure where security barriers will be in public places that access routes will remain open until the very last minute.
"So I am grateful to the public for their continued support and understanding and apologise in advance if any of our activity causes any disruption or inconvenience to them."
Closures around the Celtic Manor will be in effect from 22:00 BST on 31 August until 07:00 BST on 6 September.
Fencing work is set to start on Thursday in Cardiff.  Bute Park, North Road, Castle Street and Duke Street are all set to be finished by 21 August before fencing goes up around Roath Basin between 22-29 August.
The last time Britain hosted the Nato summit was 24 years ago in London.
The event in Wales will also mark the 65th anniversary of Nato.
