First residents arrive at Glasgow's Athletes' Village

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first residents are moving in to homes in the east end of Glasgow built to accommodate athletes at last year's Commonwealth Games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Athletes' Village in Dalmarnock was home to about 7,000 competitors and officials during the Games last summer.
The 38.5 hectare site was reconfigured afterwards and now features 300 private homes, 400 homes for social rent and a new 120-bed care home for the elderly.
By the end of Friday, about 100 homes on the site will be occupied.
The remainder of the homes are expected to be filled by the end of the summer.
Of the socially rented homes, 200 will be for Thenue Housing Association, 102 for West of Scotland Housing Association and 98 for Glasgow Housing Association.
More than 250 of the 300 private homes have so far been sold.
