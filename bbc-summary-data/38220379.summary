Dovedale walkers told stepping stones 'impassable'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walkers in the Peak District have been told not to use the famous Dovedale stepping stones because two have been washed out of position.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One of the stones crossing the River Dove has become partially submerged while a second has been moved to the side following recent heavy rain.
The National Trust has asked people to use a footbridge further downstream if they want to cross the river.
The stepping stones attract hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.
They were last closed to walkers four years ago when two stones were dislodged by floodwater causing tree branches and debris collecting behind them.
Derbyshire County Council said engineers would visit the site to assess the damage before it knew how long the stones would be out of action.
