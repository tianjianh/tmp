South Africa election: Does the ANC deserve to stay in power?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Election campaigns are exhausting things. But Mmusi Maimane seemed to be wrestling with more than the usual sore throat, as he considered the opposition's non-existent chances of unseating South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC) after 20 years in power.

"It's been a very, very difficult campaign," said the 33-year-old national spokesman for the Democratic Alliance (DA), with a mixture of frustration and impatience, as he described the "onslaught we face from the ANC".
Citing a few incidents of alleged violence, the blocking of advertisements on the public broadcaster, and the co-option of state institutions by the ANC, Mr Maimane suggested "the incumbents are starting to use the same practices as we've seen in other African states, more specifically in Zimbabwe. These trends are beginningâ€¦ as the ANC start to demonstrate the tendencies of [President Robert Mugabe's] Zanu-PF."
Sour grapes, or spot on?
Across town on Sunday, about 100,000 ANC supporters gathered at the giant FNB World Cup stadium in a daunting show of the governing party's organisational muscle ahead of Wednesday's poll.

It was a joyful affair, with plenty of dancing and music.
"I grew up in poverty but because of the ANC I went to university for free, I studied for free, and now I'm working and getting paid. I'm one of those people who have achieved my dreams," Zanele Ngcobo, 24, told me, insisting that the governing party had the systems in place to tackle corruption.
But tens of thousands began to drift away as President Jacob Zuma launched into one of his more turgidly uninspiring speeches.
Mr Zuma has faced months of fierce criticism for the Nkandla scandal - taxpayers' money lavished on his private residence.
And yet polls suggest that the ANC will once again get more than 60% of the vote on Wednesday - an impressive result for a party that has faced fierce criticism from some quarters for its failure to promote economic growth, and to tackle enduringly high unemployment as well as corruption.
So how come the ANC remains so immune to the electoral disaffection? Here's my list, in no particular order:
There is a theory about the "30-year-rule" for liberation movements - the amount of time that history suggests they can expect to hold onto power having won a democratic election. On current voting trends, South Africa could yet be on track to shore up that premise.
