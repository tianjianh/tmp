Chris Hume, 28, admitted the offences which took place in a Glasgow flat on 11 October last year.
The High Court in Glasgow heard he had never been alone with the child until the day of the incident. When his parents returned home, the boy told them what had happened.
Hume is due to be sentenced next month.
The court heard that following the incident, Hume ran off leaving behind two phones. The family then contacted the police.
Police Scotland's Cybercrime Unit managed to extract footage from the accused's phone.
The boy can be heard on the footage saying "I want to see the camera" and the accused replies "Quick, quick. Before your daddy comes".
Hume is expected to sentenced next month at the High Court in Edinburgh by judge Lady Scott.
