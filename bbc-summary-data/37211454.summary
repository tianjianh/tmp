World Cup qualifiers: Serbia 2-2 Republic of Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Daryl Murphy's first international goal earned the Republic of Ireland a lucky draw in their opening World Cup qualifier in a rain-lashed Belgrade.

Jeff Hendrick's deflected effort gave the Republic the perfect start as they held out until half-time despite almost constant Serbian pressure.
Filip Kostic levelled on 62 minutes and Dusan Tadic scored a controversial penalty seven minutes later.
The Irish looked beaten but Murphy headed the equaliser on 81 minutes.
Murphy's goal ended his long drought for the Republic as the Newcastle striker, 33, finally broke his international duck in his 24th appearance.
The Republic failed to build on the ideal start of Hendrick's third-minute goal as his low shot deflected in off Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. It was a first international goal for Burnley's recent record signing from Derby.
For the remainder of the contest, the Republic struggled to retain possession as Kostic and Southampton striker Tadic caused the visitors no end of problems.
Only poor Serbian finishing and a splendid save by West Ham keeper Darren Randolph from Kostic kept the Irish in front by the interval.
Serbia's deserved equaliser came on 62 minutes as Kostic slotted from close range after Tadic had outfoxed John O'Shea in the Republic penalty area.
With the home side continuing to run at the ragged Irish, they were awarded a highly-debatable penalty with Jonathan Walters' contact on a charging Kostic just inside the area looking minimal.
Tadic dispatched the penalty into the roof of the net and the Republic were fortunate not to go 3-1 in arrears three minutes later as substitute Andrija Pavlovic hammered against the crossbar after Randolph spilled a Filip Mladenovic shot.
But the Republic summoned up a response, with Walters having an effort ruled out for offside and James McClean going close before Murphy powered in a headed equaliser as he connected with a Brady corner.
Given the Republic's defensive nervousness all night, it was no surprise that they had further late scares with Seamus Coleman desperately having to clear off the line after Randolph had blocked an Ivanovic effort.
The West Ham keeper rode his luck at times but made a couple of vital saves during stages of the contest when the Serbian were threatening to over-run the visitors.
In truth, few of his outfield colleagues were particularly impressive in a display where the Republic were guilty of squandering possession and resorting to long balls on too many occasions.
After the first round of fixtures, the Republic sit behind leaders Wales and Austria, who won against Moldova and Georgia respectively.
Martin O'Neill's side return to World Cup qualifier action next month, hosting the Georgians on Thursday, 6 October before an away date in Moldova three days later.
The busy autumn qualifying schedule concludes away in Austria on 12 November with Ireland's Group D action resuming against Wales in Dublin on 24 March.
