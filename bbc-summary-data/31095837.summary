Aberdeen has won the unwanted title of the most dismal town in Scotland.

Urban Realm magazine said Aberdeen had become the "poor relation" of Scotland's cities as it awarded the annual Plook on the Plinth Carbuncle award to the Granite City.
Aberdeen City Council acknowledged that there was work to do to improve the heart of the city, but said progress was "well under way".
Cumbernauld, East Kilbride and Leven had been among the other contenders.
Urban Realm highlighted planning issues such as Union Terrace Gardens , Marischal Square, and missing out on the 2017 City of Culture shortlist as evidence of Aberdeen's "dismal" status.
The architecture magazine's editor John Glenday said: "Aberdeen is a great city but despite its enviable financial clout and rich heritage legacy it has become the poor relation of the Scottish cities.
"It has been left behind by the likes of Dundee, which has made huge strides to transform its waterfront.
"The time to turn things around is now. In a few years' time it may well be too late."
The trophy will he handed over on Tuesday morning.
Aberdeen City Council's planning convener Councillor Ramsay Milne said Aberdeen was an "ambitious city" which had on Monday hosted a high-level summit at which the council pressed its case for the UK government to sign up to a City Deal.
He added: "This would provide the resources to make transformational changes to sustain the city for decades to come.
"This is a proud and historic city which can trace its roots back almost a thousand years. It boasts some of the finest buildings in Scotland, including the iconic Marischal College, and also enjoys a magnificent seafront with superb maritime views.
"Aberdeen City Council recognises that there is work to do to improve the heart of the city and progress is well under way to refine a City Centre Masterplan, which will set the framework to enhance the city centre in the short, medium and long term.
"The masterplan will seek to build on the many assets which the city already has."
Steve Harris, chief executive of VisitAberdeen, said: "I am pleased that we have been given this award as anything that draws attention to Aberdeen can only help people realise how preposterous and ignorant its award is.
"Aberdeen is a stunning city with beautiful parks and gardens, a beach that runs for miles right into the city centre and some stunning architecture.
"With development proceeding apace in many parts of the city and a new City Centre Regeneration Plan due this summer, the future looks bright."
The Plook on the Plinth award was established in 2000 to provoke debate.
Previous winners of the award include Cumbernauld and Glenrothes.
