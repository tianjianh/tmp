Scotland's remote St Kilda archipelago has been digitally recreated in video game Minecraft.

Games company ImmersiveMinds spent more than 125 hours and used more than three million virtual bricks on the 1:1 scale map of the islands.
St Kilda lies about 40 miles (64km) west of North Uist, the nearest inhabited place to the archipelago.
The last islanders left the main island of Hirta in 1930 after life there became unsustainable.
People only now live on Hirta on a temporary basis to work at the military site, or on wildlife conservation projects.
The Minecraft version of St Kilda has been made to help mark Tuesday's World Heritage Day.
The map is available for public download to allow gamers all over the world to explore the archipelago's history, heritage, stories, people and landscapes.
Nick Smith, heritage manager at Western Isles' local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, said: "This is a really exciting way to use technology so that people can discover a remote and difficult to access place."
The team from ImmersiveMinds worked closely with Jonathan Wordsworth, the St Kilda archaeologist with The National Trust for Scotland, to ensure that this digital world is as accurate as possible.
The virtual build features abandoned blackhouses, boats and underground structures called souterrains.
