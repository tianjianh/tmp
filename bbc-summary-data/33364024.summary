Greater Manchester Police said they were called to an incident in the Gorton area at about 22:00 BST on Friday 26 June.
The arrested boy has since been bailed pending further inquiries.
Det Insp Carol Hobson said: "I want to stress this was not a random stranger attack and there is no reason for any parents to be fearful."
