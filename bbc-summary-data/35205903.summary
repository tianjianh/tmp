[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ron Stone has been described as a "true champion" of St George West, the ward he had represented on Bristol City Council since 1985.
The leader of the Labour group at the council, Helen Holland, said: "Ron will be remembered as a steadfast campaigner and committed socialist."
Mr Stone died aged 73 on Wednesday.
Ms Holland said he was "dedicated to furthering social justice and equality in Bristol and beyond".
She added: "The Labour Party has lost one of its most committed councillors.
"Bristol is a better city because of Ron Stone's unwavering public service."
The city's mayor, George Ferguson, said Mr Stone had "an undying passion for Bristol".
"I always enjoyed his directness and wry humour - even when directed at me.
"As a councillor for St George West for 30 years, Ron had a vast knowledge of his neighbourhood and the people he served, making him an excellent ward councillor who made a real difference.
"With his keen sense of social justice, Ron made an enormous contribution to life in Bristol. He was an 'establishment rebel', always without his civic robes but seldom without his camera, recording people and events."
Mr Stone's roles at the council included chairing the licensing committee and the St George Neighbourhood Partnership.
The lord mayor of Bristol, councillor Clare Campion-Smith, said: "Ron was a hugely dedicated councillor who made a great contribution to his community, constituents, the council and the city over his 30 years of service.
"He was an active and passionate councillor whose presence in the chamber enlivened and enriched any debate."
