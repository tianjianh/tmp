[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southern owner seeks injunction over Aslef strikes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A train company is attempting to put a halt to strikes by the union Aslef.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), parent company of Southern Railway, has applied to the High Court for an injunction claiming the action breaches customers' rights.
Aslef said GTR is seeking "to prevent the voice of their put-upon employees being heard."
The union is planning drivers' strikes in December and January in a dispute over driver-only operated trains.
The company's chief executive Charles Horton said: "We have a responsibility to our customers to do all we can to protect their interests and maintain services for them."
The matter is likely to be considered by the High Court at a hearing in the coming days.
Earlier the RMT union, which is involved in a separate dispute, announced that it would cancel a three day strike planned over Christmas.
The Aslef strikes were announced this week, and are planned for 13-14 December, 16 December, and between 9-14 January.
Aslef drivers on the Southern network voted for walkouts by 87%.
