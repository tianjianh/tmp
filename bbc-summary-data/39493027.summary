Travis Hackett, 13, from San Diego, says the Foxes' amazing feat helped him deal with his gruelling treatment.
His trip to watch Tuesday night's home game against Sunderland was set up by a US charity that arranges football trips for young people with cancer.
The club said the teenager would be made "very welcome".
Travis said his love affair with Leicester City began when they put together a winning run to avoid relegation during the 2014-15 season.
Their title-winning success the following season coincided with his own battle against leukaemia.
He said: "I just loved how they made that great escape and then came back and surprised everyone the next year, beating all the big teams and winning the title. It was amazing.
"It was my inspiration to keep on going through all my treatment and they just helped me amazingly."
Travis is in the maintenance stage of his treatment and is considered to be cancer free but will continue with chemotherapy until next year.
Describing the moment he learned he was going to watch Leicester City play, he said: "I was speechless, I teared up. I didn't know what to say but I was over the moon. So happy."
Foxes boss Craig Shakespeare said: "He'll be made very welcome. We do things like this in the community here - not just local but international.
"When we can make a child's dream come true like that and we see the smile on his face, there's nothing better than that."
