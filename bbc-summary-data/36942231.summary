The 18-year-old is yet to make a full senior appearance for Albion but played in their pre-season draw at Bath City.
"He's that right winger we've been after," United's player-manager Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
"He's got the pace that is going to cause problems for the opposition. Hopefully we can make him a better player and he can improve us."
