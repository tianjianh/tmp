Switzerland Women 0-4 England Women

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's preparations for the European Women's Championship continued with an impressive 4-0 win in Switzerland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Sampson's side are ranked third in Europe and showed why with a comprehensive victory in Biel.
Arsenal winger Jordan Nobbs opened the scoring with a 20-yard curler before Chelsea forward Fran Kirby went round goalkeeper Gaelle Thalmann to score.
Gunners striker Jodie Taylor scored twice after the break from the edge of the area to wrap up victory.
Kirby and Toni Duggan also shot against the woodwork in a dominant Lionesses showing.
After losing to both France and Germany in the SheBelieves Cup earlier this season, Sampson's side are unbeaten in their last three games.
England - who open their Euro 2017 campaign against Scotland on 19 July - are next in action against Denmark in Copenhagen on 1 July.
