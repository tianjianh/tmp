Ephraim Norman, 24, of Thornton Heath, fatally attacked Andrew Else, 52, in Croydon in April 2014 and continued to stab him after one of the knives bent.
The Old Bailey heard two weeks before he had stabbed a teenager in the neck.
Norman, who has paranoid schizophrenia, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and attempted murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
The court was told that Norman attacked the teenager and Mr Else after he stopped taking his medication and claimed it made him impotent.
The 15-year-old was on his way home after visiting a friend when Norman hit him from behind and stole his mobile phone before fleeing the scene.
Prosecutor Alan Kent QC said the teenager was "lucky" to survive after the blade was completely buried in his head with the tip poking out the other side.
Weeks later, Norman went out armed with two weapons and stabbed Mr Else, of Forestdale in Selsdon Park Road, Croydon, after following him when he got off a bus.
Scotland Yard said the two men who had reported the attack to police had caught a glimpse of "Norman raising the knife above his head repeatedly stabbing Mr Else".
When he was arrested, Norman told police that he did not trust himself in public and that he did not feel sorry for Mr Else or his family because he was being driven by voices in his head.
He told officers: "It is just my madness, it is just like how my mind is.... I know I could do that again. It is not a big thing for me to do ... I wanted him to die so much I just kept on stabbing him until he was dead."
Judge Anthony Morris QC described Mr Else as a "perfectly respectable man" who was savagely attacked because he happened to be "in the wrong place at the time".
