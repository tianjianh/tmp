Scottish League Two: Forfar lose for first time this season

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leaders Forfar Athletic suffered their first League Two defeat of the season, going down 3-1 at home to Montrose.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They remain seven points clear of Clyde in second, the Bully Wee having drawn 1-1 away to Berwick Rangers.
Edinburgh City and Arbroath played out a six-goal thriller at Meadowbank, taking a point apiece.
City remain bottom, with Cowdenbeath in ninth after a 2-0 home defeat by Stirling Abion, while Annan Athletic are fifth after beating Elgin City.
Forfar boasted a perfect record of seven wins from seven league matches ahead of their derby with Montrose but were stunned as the visitors inflicted their first defeat of the league campaign.
Gary Fraser and Christopher Templeman scored either side of half-time before Gary Fraser added a 66th-minute penalty to put Montrose out of sight.
Danny Denholm headed an injury time consolation for Forfar, but the day belonged to Montrose, who move up to seventh in the table.
Clyde failed to take full advantage of Forfar's slip-up as they were held at Berwick. Sean Higgins gave Barry Ferguson's men the lead, but Steven Thomson equalised for the home side just before the break.
Elgin remain in third despite going down 2-0 at home to Annan. Darren Ramsey's opener and a David McKenna penalty were enough to seal the points for the visitors.
Game of the day was at Meadowbank as bottom side Edinburgh claimed a point after sharing six goals in a thriller with Arbroath.
The visitors twice took the lead with goals from Omar Kader and Ricky Little, only to be pegged back by strikes from Craig Beattie and Ouzy See.
See struck again as City took the lead for the first time, but Arbroath levelled through Martin Scott and, despite the visitors having Jass Sukar sent off late on, they held on to claim a point.
Stirling won at Cowdenbeath to leapfrog their opponents in the table. Isaac Layne and Darren Smith struck to ensure Stirling move up to eighth in the table.
