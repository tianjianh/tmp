[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 1-0 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Adebayo Akinfenwa's winner five minutes from time handed Wycombe a hard-fought 1-0 home victory over Exeter in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Akinfenwa chested down in the box and saw his deflected shot fly past Bobby Olejnik to continue Wycombe's impressive home form - they have lost just one of six league games at Adams Park this term.
Paul Hayes should have given the hosts the lead after 18 minutes when a bouncing ball fell to him five yards out but his looping header cleared the crossbar.
Exeter striker Reuben Reid's driven 27th-minute shot bounced dangerously in front of Wycombe keeper Jamal Blackman, who temporarily spilled, and the visitors were then denied a glorious chance as Ollie Watkins was penalised for a foul when one-on-one.
The Chairboys dominated the second period as substitute Akinfenwa nodded over and Paris Cowan-Hall flicked Joe Jacobson's delivery wide.
But after 85 minutes, Anthony Stewart's lofted ball from the left fell straight to Akinfenwa, allowing the big striker to turn and smash the ball past Olejnik for his second goal since joining the club.
