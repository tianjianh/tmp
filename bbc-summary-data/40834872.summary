[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers 1-3 Doncaster Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rampant second-half display from promoted Doncaster earned them victory over recently relegated Blackburn at Ewood Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Mowbray's men were the architects of their own downfall, gifting John Marquis an opener and conceding a second from the penalty spot before a calamitous goalkeeping error resulted in a third.
A consolation goal for Dominic Samuel could not lift spirits.
After enjoying the majority of possession, Blackburn gifted an opener to the visitors in the first minute after the interval as Elliott Ward failed to control a simple pass and Marquis ran clear to slot home.
Charlie Mulgrew brought down James Coppinger in the area midway through the half and the Doncaster captain fired the resulting penalty straight down the middle.
Tommy Rowe and Ben Gladwin both saw efforts well saved for Blackburn but Alfie May slotted a third Doncaster goal into an empty net after goalkeeper David Raya inexplicably headed a long ball straight to him.
Samuel headed in his first goal for Rovers shortly afterwards but Doncaster claimed their first win at Ewood Park.
