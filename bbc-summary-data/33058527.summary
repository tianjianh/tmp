Dominic Doyle, 21, from Denton, Greater Manchester, died from stab wounds in hospital on 7 June after police were called to a report of a fight.
A 15-year-old boy is also being held on suspicion of murder, while another man, 21, has been released without charge.
Mr Doyle's parents said he was "fun, caring, loving and a cheeky chappie".
They said: "He had a heart of gold and would help anyone.
"His last comment on Facebook was, 'Love my life, wouldn't change a thing. I have the best mum and dad and the best group of mates'.'"
Det Ch Insp Ian Crewe, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP), appealed for witnesses to contact the police.
He said they wanted "anyone who was either at or in the vicinity of Hughes' pub on Manchester Road in Denton in the early hours of Sunday morning to please get in touch".
