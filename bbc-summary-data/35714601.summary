[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police dog that fatally injured a Yorkshire terrier in an unprovoked attack has been suspended from duty.

Barbie was bitten on Monday night by Falco, a German shepherd, on a private lane, and was put down due to the extent of her injuries.
Falco's operational licence has been removed while the incident is investigated, Lincolnshire Police said.
The suspension was "normal practice" and was "not a pre-judgement of the circumstances", it said.
No action has been taken against Falco's handler Mick Judge, who the force said was "very upset" by the incident.

Barbie's owner Charles Giermak described Monday's attack, near Fishtoft, Boston, as a "horrible sight".
He said the other dog came out of the darkness and shook three-year-old Barbie "like a rag doll".
Mr Giermak, who was out walking with Barbie and her daughter Candy, said: "There was no barking, no growling - nothing - it just attacked."
He said the attack could have been prevented if the police dog had been wearing a muzzle.
