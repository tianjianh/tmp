Holly Thomas had to pass exams on mathematics, electronics and health and safety to qualify for the licence.
She said she now hopes to make contact with an astronaut on board the International Space Station.
Amateur radio operators, or radio hams, have been around since the first half of the 20th century.
Holly said: "I was in my bedroom every day reading, writing, doing mock-exams. I've probably done about 20 mock-exams.
"I love it because you can contact people all over the world and make friends.
"Sometimes if you're lucky you can contact astronauts and that's pretty good."
Holly's father, Christopher said she had shown a keen interest in amateur radio from a young age.
"Sometimes I'd go into the room and have my radio set up then I'd realise all my settings had been changed. It would take me an hour to put it right because Holly had been pressing all the buttons," he said.
It is claimed the "mayday" calls from the Titanic were heard by amateur radio enthusiast Artie Moore from Blackwood in 1912.
