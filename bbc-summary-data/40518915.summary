Stam extended his contract with the Royals until summer 2019 on Tuesday after leading them to the Championship play-off final in his first season.
"The club is very happy with me, I'm very happy with the club and the people we work with," he told BBC Sport.
"The new owners have certain plans as well to hopefully give us that extra push towards promotion next season."
Former Manchester United and Netherlands defender Stam, 44, had a year left on his previous deal before agreeing a new two-year contract.
Following Reading's third-place finish and subsequent defeat on penalties by Huddersfield at Wembley last season, he had been linked with a number of vacancies in the Premier League and in Europe.
"People didn't need to convince me (to stay)," he told BBC Radio Berkshire. "We had a great season last year.
"We started a project over here that hopefully within a couple of seasons, we can have a go at the Premier League. We'd like to continue that.
"If you look at the bigger picture, everything seems right and we started it last season. I've loved my time here, working with the players and improving everything within the club."
