Richard Hibbard: Gloucester hooker 'never too old' for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hooker Richard Hibbard says he has not given up on playing for Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 2013 British and Irish Lions tourist recently signed a new contract at English Premiership Gloucester, the club he joined from Ospreys in 2014.
The 32-year-old has not played for Wales since scoring a try in the 21-35 defeat by Ireland in a World Cup warm-up match in August 2015.
But when asked if he still had international ambitions, Hibbard said: "You're never too old."
Hibbard was left out of Wales' squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
His chances of adding to his 38 caps will have been made harder by the Welsh Rugby Union's senior player selection policy which means only three players who play outside Wales can be picked.
He has played 11 times for Gloucester so far this season in all competitions and has scored four tries in his 58 appearances for the club and had no hesitation in signing a new deal.
"I'm excited by the brand of rugby we've been playing this year," added Hibbard, who was part of the successful British and Irish Lions side which secured a series win in Australia in 2013
"It's faster, more physical in defence and I find it a real good brand. I've enjoyed playing it and it was a no brainer in the end.
"I feel I'm playing alright. There's always more and there's always improvements and I'll keep striving for them."
