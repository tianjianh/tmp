Harry Redknapp: Birmingham City boss disappointed not to be safe as Villa lost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City boss Harry Redknapp is upset that his side are not already safe from relegation in the Championship, despite the elation of beating Huddersfield Town with 10 men.

Had Steve Bruce's Aston Villa avoided defeat at Blues' nearest rivals Blackburn, City's win would have assured them of staying up.
As it is, they now may still need something at Bristol City next Sunday.
"Steve Bruce must be disappointed with that," Redknapp told BBC WM.
"You'd think Villa would go up there and get something. That's a disappointing result for them. But then they were poor against us at Villa Park last weekend. No way they deserved to beat us.
"Steve's a top man and a top manager, but he's got a big job on his hands there, hasn't he?"
For the second time in four seasons, Birmingham now find themselves going into the final day having not yet secured their survival.
At Bolton, in 2014, it took an injury-time strike from Paul Caddis to keep them up. This time, Redknapp insists that his side must go for all three points at Ashton Gate.
Blues will start two points clear of both 21st-placed Nottingham Forest, who are at home to Ipswich, and 22nd-placed Blackburn Rovers, who are at Brentford.
But Blues have a worse goal difference and, if Redknapp's men fail to win, they will go down if both Blackburn and Forest gain victories.
"We have to win," insists Redknapp. "A point is useless. A draw doesn't affect anything. If you lose and they don't win, you're safe and, if they both win, you need three points."
Redknapp says the club will appeal against the red card given by referee Mike Jones to Che Adams for his 23rd-minute challenge on Martin Cranie.
"We will," confirmed Redknapp. "You've got to, as the kid didn't deserve it. He's a smashing boy. Not an aggressive player. He was in bits after the game.
"I've looked at it a dozen times. It was a poor sending-off. He was on the floor going for the ball. No way it was a red card. But you know how difficult it is."
Blues have been successful with one appeal following a dismissal this season, when club captain Paul Robinson had his red card overturned following Blues' 2-1 win at Wolves in February - their last victory prior to Saturday.
The Football Association's disciplinary system worked against Blues this week as Robinson was retrospectively banned for three games following an incident in last Sunday's derby, which was only picked up on video.
But that meant a surprise recall for first team skipper Michael Morrison after three months out with an injury - and he led a backs-to-the wall performance.
"He only trained with us for the first time on Thursday," Redknapp added. "I didn't see any chance of him playing but he stuck his hand up to play and that's why he's the sort of captain he is."
