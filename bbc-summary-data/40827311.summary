A muntjac deer had to be rescued after it got stuck in the wheel of a watermill inside a restaurant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The small doe got trapped between two paddles on the traditional feature at the Moor Mill Beefeater in Bricket Wood, St Albans.
It was freed by the RSPCA which said the frightened animal most likely fell into the river outside.
Kate Wright, who rescued the deer, said: "It was quite a sight for the diners having their lunch."
The animal collections officer said the muntjac was probably drawn under the building by the current and became caught up in the water wheel.
In struggling to climb out to get out of the water, the deer became stuck in the paddles.

"This poor muntjac was in a real fix. She was really frightened. She was thrashing about and loudly barking," said Ms Wright.
"It would have been very distressing for such a timid wild animal to find herself stuck like that, so I knew I'd have to work fast to free her."
The deer has been released back into the wild.
