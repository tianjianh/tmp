Cecile Pieper put world number seven side Germany ahead in the first quarter with a lofted finish past goalkeeper Maddie Hinch.
England created plenty of chances but were unable to repeat the 4-1 victory of their opening match over Ireland.
Meanwhile, England men opened their campaign with a comprehensive 6-0 victory over Poland in Pool B.

Two penalty corner strikes from Mark Gleghorne gave England the perfect start.
And before half-time, they had doubled that lead through a deflected Chris Griffiths strike and Sam Ward's drag flick from a penalty corner.
David Condon turned in Phil Roper's pass for the fifth and Ward added his second to round off the victory.
England men face Germany on Monday and Ireland on Wednesday; victory in either of their next two games would see them progress to the semi-finals.
The women take on 17th-ranked Scotland, who drew 0-0 with Ireland, on Tuesday at 11.30 BST. A point from the game would see England into the last four.
