The 23-year-old joined Salford in January 2016 after a spell at rugby union side Exeter Chiefs where he did not make a single appearance.
Jones, who can play across the back-row or as a centre, left St Helens to move to Exeter.
"The club are clearly on the rise and have come a long way in short time," he told the Salford website.
He joins Jake Bibby, Josh Wood and Lee Mossop in signing new deals at the club this week.
