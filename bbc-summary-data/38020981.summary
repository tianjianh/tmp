In Ottawa, swastikas were painted on Jewish synagogues and community centres.
In Etobicoke, a neighbourhood of Toronto, "It's the Jews" was scrawled on the wall of an elementary school.
Local police are investigating the incidents.
"To the Canadian Jewish community: I stand with you. Our government denounces recent acts of anti-Semitism in the strongest terms," Mr Trudeau tweeted.
Hundreds of hate attacks have been recorded in the US since the election, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Hate crimes were also being reported north of the border in Canada, although it is not clear if they have anything to do with the US election.
Two swastikas were spray painted on the front doors of the Machzikei Hadas synagogue in Ottawa. The graffiti was discovered Thursday morning. Security cameras had also been spraypainted over.
The incident came just days after an Ottawa Jewish prayer centre was also vandalised.
In Toronto, "It's the Jews" was scrawled on the wall of an elementary school Wednesday morning. Early in the week, the Toronto Police hate crimes unit said it was investigating after signs urging people to join the "alt-right" were posted around town.
The posters began "Hey, white person" and directed people to join white nationalist groups.
