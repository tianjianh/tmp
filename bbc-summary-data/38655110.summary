Sir Michael Wilshaw, who recently stepped down as the high-profile head of Ofsted, has revealed plans to work with schools in India.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England's former chief inspector of schools is going to become an adviser to the GEMS Education company.
Sir Michael was born in northern India and will be working with the international education firm's schools in the country.
"I have the opportunity to go back to my roots," says Sir Michael.
The GEMS group was founded by education entrepreneur Sunny Varkey, who has also funded the annual Global Teaching Prize.
Sir Michael will advise on a network of low-cost private schools in India, South East Asia and Africa.
"Low-cost schooling is a very popular and growing choice for millions of Indian families," says Sir Michael, who was born in Shimla in the foothills of the Himalayas, before moving with his family to London at the age of two.
As the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael was known as an outspoken figure in education debates, often clashing with ministers.
The former head teacher had been a strong advocate of raising standards in state schools - and had been critical of private schools.
He will now be working with Tony Little, former head of Eton College, who is the group's chief education officer.
"Sir Michael Wilshaw has a remarkable track record of transforming low-achieving schools in England into outstanding ones through strong values and innovative methods within classrooms," said Mr Varkey, the Indian-born founder of the GEMS education business.
"He has continuously raised the bar on excellence."
In 2015, Mr Varkey became the first education entrepreneur to sign up for the Giving Pledge, a commitment launched by Bill Gates, in which the wealthy pledge to give away most of their money to philanthropic causes.
