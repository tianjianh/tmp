Life banning orders will be issued if there is deemed sufficient evidence of the fans' involvement in Tuesday's incident, the football club said.
Amateur video showed a man being pushed from the Metro train while a group chants, "we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it".
Police are investigating the incident.
In a statement, Chelsea, which plays its matches at Stamford Bridge, said it had received "substantial information" following a witness appeal.
The incident was filmed by a British man ahead of Tuesday night's Champions League match, which the London club drew 1-1 with Paris St-Germain.
The footage was obtained by the Guardian, which reported that the incident had happened at Richelieu-Drouot station in the centre of the French capital on Tuesday evening.
The victim has since called for the fans to be punished.
The 33-year-old, named as Souleymane S, told France's Le Parisien: "These people, these English fans... should be locked up."
The abuse has drawn widespread condemnation from the world of football.
Chelsea condemned the behaviour as "abhorrent", while Prime Minister David Cameron told LBC Radio on Wednesday that the footage looked "extremely disturbing and very worrying".
Sepp Blatter, president of world football's governing body Fifa, tweeted that there was "no place for racism in football".
The investigation is being led by Paris police with support from the Metropolitan Police.
