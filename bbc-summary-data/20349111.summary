[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservative candidate Adam Simmonds has been elected Northamptonshire's first police and crime commissioner (PCC).

Turnout in Thursday's poll was 19.82% and the winner was announced at Kettering Conference Centre.
Five candidates were hoping to win the role to oversee policing of the county, which has a population of 692,100.
The new PCCs will replace police authorities.
They will have powers to set budgets and "hire and fire" chief constables.
Former senior officer at Northamptonshire County Council Mr Simmonds won against Lee Barron with 57.3% after second preferences were counted.
Mr Barron, who had been Labour candidate, tried to pull out of the election because of a conviction 22 years ago which would make him ineligible to be a PCC.
But Mr Barron came to the decision too late to withdraw as a candidate.
The Home Office said if a disqualified candidate won there would have to be a by-election.
During the campaign Mr Simmonds said: "I will be a progressive, considered and modern thinking commissioner. I will not intrude on police operational responsibilities.
"I do not want issues to become party political and will work closely and co-operatively with the new Northamptonshire Police and Crime Panel.
"I will listen to the experiences and concerns of ordinary people, especially where crime impacts most.
"I will ensure public concerns are reflected in policing priorities, while remaining vigilant champions of the civil liberties of local minorities."
