Bunney gave the visitors the lead when he headed Joe Rafferty's cross beyond City keeper Ben Williams.
Tony McMahon crossed for Rory McArdle to stab in Bradford's equaliser, but Bunney restored Rochdale's lead with a shot from just outside the area.
Steven Davies headed in McMahon's corner to level the scores, while Grant Holt hit the post for the Dale late on.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I thought the performance was good, it was more like the way we play.
"It gives me a lot of belief looking at the last 15 games because we were excellent today.
"We scored two really good goals and for the majority of the game we defended exceptionally well.
"We created opportunities, so from the performance perspective, I'm really pleased, but I'm disappointed with the result."
