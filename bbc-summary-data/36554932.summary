Clint Hill has gone from being discarded by Queens Park Rangers to feeling like a film star at Rangers after signing for the Glasgow club.

The 37-year-old has agreed a one-year contract with the promoted club and is surprised by the media interest.
"The biggest challenge is going to be getting used to the focus you receive as a Rangers player up here," he said.
"I walked out of baggage reclaim and thought there was a Hollywood superstar behind me."
Hill spent six years with the London club but was released at the end of the season after playing only 15 times in the last campaign.
But the Englishman will use Rangers assistant David Weir, who spent the last five years of his career at Ibrox and captained the side to three successive league titles, as his example.
"I've got massive respect for Davie because I know how hard it is to stay in this game," said Hill. "It can eat you alive at certain points.
"I think he stayed in until he was 41 and played in a Uefa Cup final. That's an unbelievable achievement.
"I'll be pestering him on a daily basis to get some inspiration from him."
Hill began his career with Tranmere Rovers and had spells with Oldham Athletic, Stoke City and Crystal Palace before switching to Loftus Road, where his side finished 12th in last season's Championship.
"I've passed my medical, so hopefully they are happy with me," he said. "My body has held up so far over a 20-year career.
"I've always kept myself fit so I'm ready for the challenge. I'm not here for a jolly up or retirement. I'm here to work.
"I had options abroad and could have taken the easy way out and gone to a league with less pressure, but when Rangers come knocking, you can't turn that down."
Hill is Mark Warburton's fifth signing as he prepares for the Scottish Premiership season after the arrivals of midfielders Joey Barton, who is a former team-mate at QPR, Matt Crooks, Josh Windass and Jordan Rossiter.
"I've not stopped smiling," he said. "I didn't think Rangers would be interested in a 37-year-old defender.
"But I'm extremely proud and very excited to be here. I'm looking forward to the challenge."
