'Bored' mobile phone course driver asks for fine and penalty points

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver caught using his mobile phone asked for penalty points and a fine rather than opt for a "boring" course, police have said.

The unnamed motorist stated on a caution form he had completed a driver improvement course the day before.
He wrote: "Just give me the points and fine - I did the mobile phone course yesterday. It was as boring as hell."
Police forces in England sometimes offer courses as an alternative to penalties for motoring offences.
The force's road policing team shared a photo of the form on Twitter with the comment: "Some will never learn".
Officers said the risks associated with using a phone while driving are very clear.
No details about where the man was stopped have been released.
