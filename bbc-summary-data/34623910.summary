[SN]TITLE[SN]
West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Vardy scored for the eighth game in a row to help Leicester come back from a goal down to beat West Brom.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The England striker scored after two goals from Riyad Mahrez early in the second half had put the Foxes ahead.
Leicester dominated early on, but Salomon Rondon's near-post header gave West Brom the lead before the break.
Rickie Lambert's late penalty reduced the arrears but Leicester hung on for the win and remain unbeaten away from home so far this season.
The result and their fine run on the road pushed Claudio Ranieri's side into third place in the Premier League.
The home side had not conceded a goal in their last two outings and were on the back foot until Rondon's opener.
Mahrez's two goals in seven minutes provoked a strong reaction from West Brom, but Vardy's strike looked to have secured a comfortable win for Leicester.
Late substitute Lambert forced a save from close range in the dying seconds after grabbing his first goal since moving to The Hawthorns.
Minutes before he had extended his scoring streak, Vardy's participation in the rest of the game had looked in doubt.
The 28-year-old went down clutching his right ankle, and had extensive treatment on the pitch, but the magic sponge did the trick with his 11th goal of the season a few seconds later.
Leicester had forced the pace in the opening half-an-hour, with Vardy hitting the post after just seven minutes.
But they did not take several other chances, and West Brom made the most of their first real opportunity when Rondon's powerful header had too much on it for Foxes goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.
West Brom's defence had held firm in their two previous outings, but they were caught napping by teasing crosses from Marc Albrighton from either side of the pitch for both of Mahrez's goals.
Vardy's pace had tested the home back line all afternoon, and he used it to good effect when slicing through to make it 3-1 to the visitors.
West Brom go to Old Trafford to face Manchester United next weekend, and follow that with a visit to Arsenal.
Leicester will look to build on their fine start to the season by hosting Watford, and follow this by a trip to St James' Park to take on Newcastle United.
West Brom manager Tony Pulis: "Leicester did really well, it was a good game and in Jamie Vardy they have an exceptional player. His pace frightened us all afternoon.

"But the referee should have given us a penalty and sent their man off. It shouldn't happen at this level - the standard of refereeing should be better.
"[Referees' chief] Mike Riley should be on the phone asking why we weren't given two penalties.

"I've had a go in the tunnel with him and I apologise about that. I should be writing my report but I do hope they look at it."
Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: "We fight to the end. We have a very strong character and play good football.
"I told my players they were playing very well at half-time, to be careful at set-plays, and it was important to move the ball quickly and put them under pressure. We did that well.
"It's important Jamie Vardy continues to work for the team. The record is good for everybody."
