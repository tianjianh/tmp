Former media mogul Conrad Black has been released from prison in Miami after serving just over three years for defrauding investors.

His wife greeted him at their home in Toronto, Canada, and he was seen on the estate grounds by 14:00 (16:00 GMT).
Black, 67, who controlled an empire including the Daily Telegraph in the UK, and US papers including the Chicago Sun-Times, left prison early on Friday.
Earlier, Canada said he would be allowed to live there upon his release.
Black was born in Canada but renounced his citizenship in 2001 to accept a peerage in Britain's House of Lords. He is a British citizen.
The move to grant Black a one-year temporary residence permit stirred debate in Canada's House of Commons.
Tom Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic Party, said Black had received special treatment.
"No-one else has ever been in that situation, of being still in jail, having his dossier marched around all the offices of the minister and getting his approval before even getting out of the slammer," Mr Mulcair said, according to CBC News.
But Citizenship and Immigration Minister Jason Kenney countered that approval of Black's application had been processed by "highly trained, independent members of our public service" and had not been subject to political interference.
In 2007 Black was convicted of defrauding Hollinger International shareholders of $6.1m (Â£3.8m), by paying himself a tax-free bonus from the sale of newspaper assets without the approval of the company's board.
He had been forced out of the company by shareholders in 2003.
After his conviction, Black was sentenced to 78 months in prison. He was released two years later while he pursued a partially successful appeal, in which a judge cut his sentence down to 42 months, including the 29 months he had already served.
Black reported to prison in September to complete the remainder of his sentence but was released after eight months on good behaviour.
Upon his release, Black was transferred to the custody of US immigration authorities before he travelled to Canada.
As a British citizen, he could have returned to Britain.
Black, who became Lord Black of Crossharbour, was known for his extravagant lifestyle.
It was reported that he had two apartments on Park Avenue in New York - one for himself and his wife, writer Barbara Amiel, and one for his domestic staff.
