An incident as a child meant Angellica "has never had a great relationship" with swimming, but Make Your Move have been along to see her in training.
You can learn more about Angellica's story in the video above.
Make Your Move is hosting a live Facebook Q&A with Rebecca Adlington, Mark Foster and Dr Victoria King to discuss anything and everything to do with getting started at the pool.
