[SN]TITLE[SN]
Moray Council tax rise of 3% agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Moray councillors have backed a 3% rise in council tax.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The increase adds £34.05 to a Band D property.
Local authorities can increase the basic rate of council tax by up to 3% for the first time since 2007, but higher-band properties will pay more regardless after MSPs approved changes.
This will see Band H properties in Moray pay £594.17 more.
