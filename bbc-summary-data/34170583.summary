Pace bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile has become the latest Australia player to be ruled out of the rest of the one-day international series against England.

Opener David Warner broke a thumb during Saturday's second ODI and was replaced by Yorkshire's Aaron Finch.
Injuries to all-rounder Shane Watson (calf) and Coulter-Nile (hamstring) in that game have forced the tourists to raid county cricket again.
John Hastings and Peter Handscomb join the squad for Tuesday's third ODI.
Seamer Hastings, 29, has been Durham's overseas player this summer. He has played 11 ODIs for Australia, with his last international appearance being his only Test in December 2012.
Uncapped wicketkeeper-batsman Handscomb, 24, born in Melbourne to English parents, has been playing for Gloucestershire this season on a UK passport.
Although he has featured for Australia A, if he were to appear for the full international side, it would threaten his ability to continue as a "domestic" player in England.
It means Australia have lost the services of seven players since their tour began in late June.
Paceman Ryan Harris retired before the start of the Ashes Test series, keeper Brad Haddin missed a Test for family reasons and left the tour early, while captain Michael Clarke and opener Chris Rogers retired after the final Test.
Coach Darren Lehmann said of the latest trio of withdrawals: "We looked at all options including the possibility of flying in cover from Australia.
"But the fact all three of the players we have drafted in are already in England means they can join us at short notice, be acclimatised to conditions and be available for selection immediately, if required."
Australia lead the five-match series 2-0, with the third ODI at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
