Pramerica Systems Ireland: 330 new jobs for Letterkenny

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A technology support company is to create 330 jobs in County Donegal over the next three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pramerica Systems Ireland currently employs 1,250 people in Letterkenny.
A subsidiary of US-based Prudential Financial, it provides business and software support for its parent company.
It is building a new campus in the town that could accommodate 1,800 staff, and it says there is the potential for further growth.
The firm, founded in County Donegal in 2000, will be recruiting senior IT managers, project managers, business analysts, data scientists, actuaries and accountants.
It will also have roles in technology support and professional services.
Pramerica vice president Gerard Grant said it was an exciting time for the company.
"We've been here for 15 years and have just had a fantastic experience - we started off originally with just eight employees and we've grown to 1,250," he told BBC Radio Foyle.
"Today we're announcing the 330 jobs expansion and, off the back of that, a brand new campus just a kilometre away to house that expansion."
Mr Grant said salaries would be highly competitive.
"We are immediately hiring and there's nearly 70 openings on our website right now for people across legal, digital, data science, software development and a range of support jobs," he said.
"These are professional jobs, not low paid jobs - there's a lot of talent out there that we would hope to attract to Donegal."
