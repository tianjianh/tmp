Edgar Colliander, 35, from Edinburgh, pleaded guilty to wilfully setting fire to cardboard at Sunrite Blinds at Newhailes Industrial Estate, Musselburgh, on 25 January 2015.
He was appearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Frank Crowe deferred sentence for background reports.
Fiscal depute Ann MacNeill said the company was set up by Colliander's father in 1979, employing 42 people at two sites.
The property was leased. Ms MacNeill said during 2014, the company experienced some financial difficulties.
On 25 January 2015 neighbours saw smoke coming from the factory and dialled 999.
Fire service investigators found two sets of cardboard packaging had been set on fire.
"CCTV footage showed the accused attending at the factory on the Sunday at 15:16 and the fire starting at 15:21," said the fiscal.
She added when Colliander was questioned, he admitted starting the fire. Ms MacNeill said the cost of the fire to the insurance company was £237,764.
Defence solicitor, David Hunter, told the court shortly after the fire, the company went into administration.
There had been no danger to the public as there was no residential property nearby.
