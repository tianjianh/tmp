A man famously pictured helping a woman at the scene of one of the 7/7 bombings says he has received an e-mail from police over the phone hacking scandal.

Paul Dadge, from Cannock, helped survivors outside Edgware Road Tube Station in 2005.
Detectives looking into claims against the News of the World have contacted the families of some victims.
The relatives have been told their details had been found at the home of a private detective.
Mr Dadge said the e-mail from Metropolitan Police said officers were going through "copious amounts of records" and may be back in touch.
He gave his reaction to the latest developments to BBC WM on Wednesday.
He said: "It's not a great surprise.
"We started off with the allegations that celebrities had had their phones hacked and when we started talking about Milly Dowler's family having their phones hacked, in the back of my head I did start to think if they're looking at Milly Dowler's phone they could be looking at people who were involved in 7/7.
"I know the kind of media pressure that was around making stories about 7/7 and the difficulties of getting hold of relatives of people who were classed as missing at that point.
"The girl in the photo, Davinia Turrell, because she wasn't talking to the press, they tried to get at her through me."
He said he thought the revelation that families' phones could have been hacked would be distressing to those involved.
"I wouldn't say I'm worried as there weren't any emotional messages for me on my phone," he said.
He added that on the day of the terrorist attacks his phone had been off because his battery had run out, but he had had between 30 and 40 voice messages stored on his phone which could have been accessed by the press.
He said the thought of someone listening to his messages had left him "a little paranoid".
