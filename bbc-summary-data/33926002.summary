A Londonderry mother, who worked at an aerospace engineering company for over a decade, said she has been left devastated after being made redundant.

Maydown Precision Engineering (MPE) in Derry employs 133 staff and supplies parts to major aircraft firms.
It was bought last month by Waterford-based Schivo Group, which said up to 15 jobs were "under consideration".
Emma McCafferty, who worked in accounts, walked through the gates at Campsie for the last time on Thursday.
Ms McCafferty said she believes more redundancies are imminent.
"I was providing for my son and I can't do that anymore," Ms McCafferty told BBC Radio Foyle.
"I worked hard and did nothing wrong. Being told there is no work for you is heartbreaking.
"I was there from when I was 17. I loved going through the gates. I feel disheartened.
"Morale is low in there and I'm left in limbo now. My friends have mortgages and Christmas is coming up. It all happened so fast.
"I think the work force will be reduced in stages.
"I do understand that they have to make cuts but it could have been handled more sensitively. The firm was our second home.
"Hopefully I get a job in the next month. Being unemployed can't be an option for me. I've never been unemployed so I don't know what it's like."
Unite said on Wednesday that there was concern for the future of 140 jobs, but a spokesman for Schivo NI accused the union of "inaccurate and irresponsible behaviour".
A spokesperson for Schivo NI said: "Schivo NI's restructuring programme is ongoing.
"The company does not comment on individual cases."
