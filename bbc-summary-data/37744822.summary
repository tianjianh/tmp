[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the death of a woman following a robbery have said two "crucial witnesses" have come forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judith Ducker, 64, is believed to have been attacked at Wellgate News on Wellgate, Rotherham, on 1 September.
She was taken to hospital with head injuries and died on Thursday.
A man and woman seen on CCTV, who could have been the last people to see Mrs Ducker before the robbery, had been located following an appeal, police said.
Results from a post-mortem examination on Mrs Ducker, who had underlying health problems, were inconclusive and did not reveal a cause of death.
South Yorkshire Police said further tests had been requested.
A 36-year-old man, Paul Blueitt, of Rotherham, has been charged with attempted murder and robbery.
