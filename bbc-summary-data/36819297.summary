The 24-year-old joins Luke Cowan-Dickie, Henry Slade and Jack Nowell in signing new deals with the Aviva Premiership side in recent weeks.
Francis joined Exeter two years ago and has 14 caps for Wales.
"Hopefully we can help keep developing him as not only a Premiership and European quality player, but also as an international," said coach Rob Baxter.
