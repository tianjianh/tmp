Scottish Labour calls for new fuel poverty target

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour has called for an "ambitious" new goal to eliminate fuel poverty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party claimed the Scottish government had failed to meet its own target on the issue.
Recent figures indicated 35% of households were in fuel poverty - defined as those who spend more than 10% of their income on heating costs.
The Scottish government said £1bn was being spent on tackling the problem and on improving energy efficiency.
It promised to look at any "constructive" proposals put forward by opposition parties.
It has also announced that an independent review of the definition of fuel poverty would be carried out.
Labour said it hoped the Scottish Parliament could unite around a new approach.
Deputy leader Alex Rowley said: "The last Labour-led government set a target to eradicate fuel poverty, but the deadline for that target has been missed and the SNP government so far has shown no appetite or ambition to reset it. That has to change.
"Labour will call on all of the parties in the Scottish Parliament to unite and set a new, ambitious target.
"This winter, thousands of children and pensioners will be cold in their own home and the government's response is to review the definition. They should be resetting the target, not moving the goal posts."
He added: "Labour wants to see a Warm Homes Act to drive up standards and regulations along with a measurable plan of action that will show year-on-year targets for eradicating fuel poverty in Scotland."
The Scottish government has defended its record on tackling fuel poverty.
A spokesman said: "By 2021, the Scottish government will have committed £1bn since 2009 to tackle fuel poverty and improve energy efficiency, helping people to heat their homes affordably.
"We have a range of schemes in place to support those who may have difficulty paying fuel bills or keeping their home warm and are already committed to introducing a Warm Homes Bill.
"As part of that process we will give careful consideration to any constructive suggestions put forward by opposition parties."
