[SN]TITLE[SN]
Royal Troon Golf Club to review male-only membership policy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Royal Troon Golf Club will undertake a "comprehensive review" of its male-only membership policy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows September's decision by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews to end its single-sex policy.
Troon has also announced it will share responsibility for hosting the 2016 Open Championship with the Ladies' Golf Club, Troon, by forming a joint championship committee.
The 2016 Open will be the ninth to be played at the Ayrshire course.
Troon is one of three clubs on the Open Championship rota with a male-only membership policy.
Muirfield is reviewing its membership criteria with a report to be completed by March 2015, while Royal St George's is "considering its position" on the matter.
Troon has always considered itself a special case in this respect as it shares facilities with the ladies' club.
But, in a statement, Troon said it will "undertake a comprehensive review to consider the most appropriate membership policy for the future" and added "the recommendations from this review will be presented to the membership for their consideration".
