Jones-Bishop opened the scoring, only for Jake Mamo, Jermaine McGillvary and Lee Gaskell tries to put the Giants 18-6 up after 23 minutes.
Trinity hit back before the break through Reece Lyne and Danny Kirmond to reduce the arrears to two points.
Dale Ferguson added to the Giants' lead before Lyne and Jones-Bishop both grabbed a second to seal the win.
Sam William's conversion after Jones-Bishop went over in the 71st minute was decisive after Martyn Ridyard slotted his fifth kick of the night with 13 minutes remaining.
Victory would have been enough to move Huddersfield back into the top eight, but their ninth defeat leaves them 10th in the table and just two points above second-from-bottom Leigh after they won 26-22 at Hull FC for their first ever Super League win away from home.
With Mamo, McGillvary and Gaskell going over in quick succession, the visitors looked to be cruising, but Chris Chester's side battled back before the interval and kept their nerve to eventually snatch a fifth straight victory.
Wakefield coach Chris Chester:  "It was pretty ugly. We definitely got out of jail.
"We've won five on the bounce and the law of averages says you're going to have a bad performance in one of them.
"Huddersfield deserved something out of that game. They were a lot better than us in a lot of areas. They outplayed us in that first 30 minutes and again in the second half.
"We really struggled in the ruck, we were very sloppy. They were better in the wrestle and left a lot of our guys on the floor. There were a few choice words at half-time and they responded well."
Huddersfield coach Rick Stone: "We're pretty disappointed with the result. The game could have gone either way. The stats are telling us it was a pretty close game in all departments.
"We let in a couple of soft tries but the effort was there. We were a little bit loose defensively in the first half even though we led 18-6. We had a chance to gain ascendancy at that stage and couldn't quite manage it.
"If we could have been tidier defensively, we might have got the result."
