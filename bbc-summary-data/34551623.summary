Former Wales rugby international Ian Gough says he witnessed medical staff being "bullied" by team coaches to keep players on the pitch.

He said they were "disgraceful scenes" and players may have suffered an injury as a result.
His comments come after a sports surgeon called for a review on the rate of injuries, saying it cannot continue.
Former Osprey Mr Gough, 38, said there is a moral responsibility to consider a player's welfare.
Speaking on the Jason Mohammad programme on BBC Radio Wales, he said: "I've seen team doctors bullied by coaches at times, absolutely bullied."
He said all team officials from coaches to physiotherapists and team doctors have a moral responsibility, not just to do what is right for "that win and for the next week's game".
"You're dealing with people's lives," added the 64-times capped second row.
"I think from age grade, everything from under eights up, coaches and parents should be taking that moral stand.
"It's just a game, much as we love this game, it's a game and people's lives are much more important."
