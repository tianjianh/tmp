As well as the three children, Sgt Obua killed a female soldier and three soldiers' wives. Two others are said to be injured during the shooting at Makindye barracks in the south of Kampala.
Army spokesperson Lt Col Paddy Ankunda tweeted "Sgt Obua... has just gone bonkers killed seven people".
He then tweeted: "We are all mourning."
The BBC's Patience Atuhaire in Kampala says that there have been several incidents of soldiers going on the rampage in Uganda.
In May, three people were killed and six injured in a bar. And in 2014, a soldier killed 10, also in a bar.
