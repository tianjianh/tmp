Team Sky's Sergio Henao held on to claim a thrilling overall victory in Paris-Nice by just two seconds from Alberto Contador.

Spain's Contador attacked to drop Colombian Henao with 52km of Sunday's eighth and final stage remaining.
But he was beaten to the stage win by Quick-Step Floors' David de la Cruz and took eight instead of 10 bonus seconds.
Henao, 29, trailed by a minute at one point but chased to finish 21 seconds down and secure the yellow jersey.
Team Sky have now won five Paris-Nice titles in the past six years and three consecutively, after former rider Richie Porte's success in 2015 and Briton Geraint Thomas' victory last year.
Ireland's Dan Martin completed the podium behind Henao and Contador, while Britain's Simon Yates finished ninth overall, following his victory on stage six.

1. Sergio Henao (Col/Team Sky) 29hrs 50mins 29secs
