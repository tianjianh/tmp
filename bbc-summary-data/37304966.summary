Plymouth Argyle summer signing Yann Songo'o says he is adapting well to his new role in central midfield.

The 24-year-old from Cameroon has spent his career as a centre-back, but has been converted to a more advanced role by manager Derek Adams.
"I prefer central defence - it's a new position for me, I never played that position before," Songo'o said.
"I learn every day in training and in the games how to play that position and I think I will get better and better."
Songo'o is following in the footsteps of Carl McHugh, who moved form a central defensive role to a midfield position under Adams last season, before leaving in the summer for Scottish Premier League side Motherwell.
The former Blackburn Rovers player spent time playing for Adams whilst on loan at Ross County in 2014 and says back then, the now Plymouth boss felt he had potential in the middle of the park.
"In a training session I played in midfield and the manager really liked the way I played, and since then he always said to me that maybe one day I would be used as a centre midfield," Songo'o told BBC Radio Devon.
"In pre-season I played for half an hour in the centre of midfield and I enjoyed it.
"The most important thing for me is being in the first 11 and whatever position he plays me in I'll always give 100%."
