The first "Super Express" train, that will replace ageing trains in the UK, has arrived from Japan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shipped to Southampton, the train is part of the Â£7.5bn modernisation of the Great Western railway line.
It will be used as a test train by staff on the rail network from April.
The 122 trains, which are longer and faster than those currently in service, are expected to start carrying passengers in 2017.
Produced by Hitachi for the Intercity Express Programme, the trains will be used on Great Western and East Coast lines.
They are capable of running at up to 140mph (225kmph).
Of the trains ordered, 12 are being manufactured in Kudamatsu City and shipped over. The remaining 110 will be constructed in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.
