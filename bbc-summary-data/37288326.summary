Lynsey Haycock, 41, was putting up a display in her classroom when she fell at Forge Valley School in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on Thursday.
Mrs Haycock was taken to hospital but died the next day as a result of medical complications.
Head teacher Dale Barrowclough said she was a "much-loved and respected teacher" at the school, an academy for 11 to 18-year-olds.
"Her dedication and hard work helped improve the life chances of all the pupils who were fortunate to have her as a teacher," he continued.
"We all came to know Mrs Haycock as a very warm-hearted person with a great sense of humour.  Not only was she treasured by staff, she was much-loved by the pupils at Forge Valley.
"As a community we are devastated by this tragic death and our thoughts are with Mrs Haycock's family and friends during this very difficult time."
It is believed Mrs Haycock was injured as she prepared for the new school term, which began on Monday.
A book of condolence has been opened at the school for people to leave their tributes to the science and health teacher.
The Health and Safety Executive said it was aware of the incident and making preliminary inquiries.
