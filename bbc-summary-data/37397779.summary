The 22-year-old, who won the 2015 US Open, shot a six-under-par 65 to pull clear of compatriot Sung Hyun Park, who signed for a 67.
Chun had six birdies and an eagle for the round, her only blot a double bogey on the ninth hole.
At 19 under, she could now record the lowest ever 72-hole score at a major.

Sweden's Henrik Stenson and Australian Jason Day jointly hold the major record at 20 under.
The women's record of 19 under is shared by four players.
"The game plan for tomorrow [Sunday] is just to keep doing the same thing," said Chun, who is in her first year on the LPGA Tour.
"I'm not going to think about winning. I just want to keep enjoying what I am doing."
