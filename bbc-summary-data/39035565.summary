[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull Moors' match with Torquay had to be postponed after a sudden downpour flooded the pitch.

Although the surface had passed an inspection earlier in the day, the amount of rain made it impossible for the match to take place.
Some Torquay fans had already arrived but Gulls manager Kevin Nicholson had no complaints about the decision.
"I don't think the referee had many options really so I can't moan, but it's a huge shame," he said.
