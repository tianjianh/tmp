Part of a Kent coal-fired power station building has been demolished in a controlled explosion.

The 35m (115ft) tall turbine hall at Kingsnorth Power Station once housed a boiler and four turbo-generators.
Many of the smaller buildings on the site have already been destroyed. The 198m (650ft) tall chimney is due to be demolished in 2017.
The power station on the Hoo peninsular was closed in 2013 after failing to meet EU emissions standards.
More than 2,000 tonnes of steel have been razed to the ground in the latest demolition, owner E.ON said.
Mike Cooper, head of demolition at E.ON said: "After the site has been completely flattened and levelled, we'll probably hang on to it.
"It was recognised as a good site for a generation station in the past, and it has a future for new technologies."
Kingsnorth Power Station was commissioned in 1970 with electricity production ending in March 2013.
In 2008 protesters gathered at the plant to campaign against E.ON's plans to build two new coal-fired units on the site.
The company announced in 2010 that it was withdrawing its plans for the new units.
The power station, which had not been adapted to meet emissions targets, ran out of its allocated operating hours under EU environmental laws.
Under the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, power stations not adapted to meet emission-reduction targets must close after generating for 20,000 hours or by the end of 2015.
