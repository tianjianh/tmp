England put in a "worrying performance" in their Euro 2016 warm-up victory over Portugal, says ex-defender Danny Mills.

Chris Smalling's late header secured a 1-0 victory over 10-man Portugal at Wembley on Thursday.
But Roy Hodgson's side, playing with a diamond formation, created few chances in their final match before their Euros opener against Russia on 11 June.
"There are many square pegs in round holes. I am not sure what system Roy is playing," Mills told BBC Radio 5 live.
Forwards Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy started an England game together for the first time, with Rooney in a number 10 role behind a Kane-Vardy strike partnership.
Tottenham's Dele Alli played on the left of midfield and James Milner on the right.
Vardy made only eight passes in the game and did not manage an attempt on goal, while Rooney and Kane had one attempt each.
"There were three centre-forwards on the pitch going for the same ball, in the same space. I don't get it. You are taking away from all those players all their strengths," said Mills.
"Rooney is taking away from Kane's position and Alli's position.
"There is a place for Rooney in this side, but it's not in the position he's in at the moment.
"You have to play Kane up front as the number nine, Alli in the 10 role and if Rooney has to play deeper or wide, he's good enough to play that role."
Tottenham's Kane and Leicester's Vardy scored 49 Premier League goals between them this season, but neither had many opportunities to receive the ball in the penalty box and were often found in wide areas.
"We played with split strikers," Hodgson said. "When you play with that system, you need your strikers to split.
"If you play with them going down the middle and Rooney in behind them, you would never be able to defend the wide areas.
"There were moments in the game where they were too wide, but basically speaking their job is to split and come together."
Captain Rooney, 30, who was replaced by Adam Lallana after 78 minutes, said England struggled to break down their opponents after Bruno Alves was sent off in the 35th minute for a high challenge on Kane.
But England won all three of their Euros warm-up matches, after victories over Australia and Turkey.
"They made it difficult but we kept going and we got the win, so that was obviously important to us," Rooney told ITV Sport.
"We are winning games when we are not playing well. We have to improve and in tournament football you have to improve to win games."
