The band announced the news on Twitter with a photograph of the field in which they'll be playing on 26 June.
They'll be the first band to headline at Worthy Farm four times.
No other Glastonbury headliners have been announced as yet - but Jeff Lynne's ELO have been confirmed for the Sunday teatime slot.
The announcement follows Coldplay's performance at the Super Bowl on 7 February, when they played a selection of their greatest hits and were joined on stage by Beyonce and Bruno Mars.
After their Super Bowl appearance, their new album A Head Full Of Dreams leapt to number one in the UK chart.
The album had previously only peaked at number two - held off by Adele at the end of last year. They have now topped the UK chart with every album they have released.
Coldplay previously headlined Glastonbury in 2002, 2005 and 2011.
The festival runs from 23-26 June.
