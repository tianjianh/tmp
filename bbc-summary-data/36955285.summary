[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee have signed striker Faissal El Bakhtaoui on a three-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old scored 30 goals for Dunfermline last season and opted to leave the League One champions under freedom of contract.
El Bakhtaoui joined the Pars from his native France in 2012 and turned down the offer of new terms.
Motherwell made an approach for the striker in May and he spent time on trial with Blackburn Rovers over the summer.
El Bakhtaoui arrives at Dens Park a few days after the transfer of Kane Hemmings to Oxford United.
Hemmings was Dundee's leading striker last season, netting 25 goals.
