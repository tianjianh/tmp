[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ben Flynn, 24, enticed the boy to his home in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, with promises to use his Playstation and offered to pay his bus fare.
Police described Flynn as a "dangerous predator".
At Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court Flynn, of Kings Walk, admitted 13 sex offences including two counts of rape and two sexual assaults.
He also pleaded guilty to three counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity and two counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act.
Flynn also admitted a breach of sex offence prevention order and one count of meeting a child following sexual grooming.
He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life.
In March last year, Flynn sent his victim a friend request on Facebook despite having never met or spoken to him.
The boy was then bombarded with private messages and Flynn offered to let him play computer games at his home.
When they met Flynn kissed the boy and touched him sexually before trying to take him to his bedroom but the boy refused.
He then pestered his victim, offered to pay his victim and went on to abuse him on two further occasions.
The boy's sister came across Flynn's messages to her brother and told her mother who phoned the police.
Det Con Claire Pickavance, of Greater Manchester Police, said the paedophile did not "show a shred of humanity" to the boy.
She added: "Ben Flynn is a dangerous predator who preyed on a young boy via social media before arranging to meet with him so that he could satisfy his own depraved urges."
