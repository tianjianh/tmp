The 26-year-old, who won one cap for Scotland in 2012, had been with the Latics for two seasons after he joined from Bristol City.
The former Kilmarnock midfielder is the seventh new signing of the summer for O's manager Andy Hessenthaler.
"He is an excellent player and we now have four central midfield players," said Hessenthaler.
"Liam played a lot of football last season for Oldham and we certainly did our homework on him and we are delighted to have him here. Liam is excited and sees where the club wants to go and he wants to be part of that."
