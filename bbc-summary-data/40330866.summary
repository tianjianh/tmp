Black pads, which formed part of the crossing, were taken from outside The Brewery Inn on High Street in Coalport, Telford, West Mercia Police said.
It is thought the theft took place between 22:00 and 23:00 BST on 12 June.
Officers want to speak to the driver of "an old Honda Civic" seen in the area at the time.

West Mercia Police spokesman Kieren Bodill said the theft had put "lives at risk for both road users and pedestrians wishing to cross the road safely".
Fiona Hotchkiss, landlady of the pub, discovered the theft the following day.
"It was a level surface but once the black bits had gone there were these panels all over the place," she said.
Miss Hotchkiss said CCTV from the pub had captured a man taking the panels.
"We've no idea why he would want them. It's a bit bizarre," she added.
