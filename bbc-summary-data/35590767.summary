Ronaldo, 31, has scored 32 goals this season but has not netted away from the Bernabeu since 29 November.
"Who else has scored more goals away from home than me since I arrived in Spain?" said Ronaldo, the all-time top scorer in the Champions League.
"Name one player who has scored more than me. No answer? OK. Thank you."
Ronaldo was speaking at a news conference before the first leg of Real's Champions League last-16 tie against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday.
In December, the Portuguese became the first player to score 10 goals in the competition's group stage.
Eleven of his goals this season have come away from home, but he has not scored in his past four away games.
"It's understandable that people have doubts," said Ronaldo. "It's like with a son when you give him everything and then when you take it away, he cries.
"I hope that I can keep this 'bad form' up until the season's end."
