[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fears have been raised that a new £37m stadium in York may not open for the start of the 2017-18 football season.

The 8,000-capacity stadium is to be home to York City Football Club and the York City Knights Rugby League Club.
It is due to open during the 2016-17 football season, but the Labour party has raised "serious concerns" about the project's progress.
Conservative Chris Steward, leader of City of York Council, said the stadium would "not fall through".
The stadium was initially due to open in August but it has already been delayed until spring 2017.
The Labour group on the council said further delays risk the stadium not being open for the 2017-18 season.
A key meeting of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat-controlled council to discuss construction contracts has been put back for a second time.
Originally scheduled for December, it is now due to be held in March.
Mr Steward said: "I can't say anything is concrete. I am not going to make any false promises.
"We will deliver that stadium, but I am not going to say one particular date."
York City said it was concerned, but would not comment further until any official notice of a delay.
Councillor Janet Looker, Labour leader on the council, said she would write to the council's chief executive for assurance the project remains on track.
