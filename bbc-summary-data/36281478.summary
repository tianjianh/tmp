A forensic psychologist has told the Liam Fee murder trial he has "no concerns" over the way two boys were interviewed by a social worker and police officer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Gary MacPherson was asked to view videos of two children Rachel and Nyomi Fee are accused of mistreating.
Nyomi Fee and her partner Rachel Fee deny murdering Liam on 22 March 2014 and blame his death on another child.
Liam was found dead in a house near Glenrothes, Fife.
The pair also face allegations that they neglected Liam and abused two other children, one of whom they blame for killing Liam, while in their care over a two-year period.
The women, who are both originally from Ryton, Tyne and Wear, deny all the charges against them.
Dr MacPherson concluded the interviews had complied with guidelines for interviewing with children.
During cross examination by Nyomi Fee's lawyer, Mark Stewart, social worker, Charlie Finlay who was one of the interviewers, defended his questioning of the boys.
He said: "I am satisfied we conducted the interview in a professional and attentive manner".
The trial at the High Court in Livingston continues.
