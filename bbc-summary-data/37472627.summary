Rovers won on Friday night to move a point ahead of the Candystripes, who were beaten 3-1 by leaders Dundalk.
"The boys were a bit down after the defeat but we're up for this game, it's a pivotal one," said Shiels.
"We have to play with passion, drive and energy - we're going to out to win and to do it in style."
Both teams have five games remaining with the Dubliners occupying third place in the League of Ireland table, which will ensure European football next season.
Derry take on Rovers before completing their league programme with games against Longford, Bohemians, Sligo Rovers and St Pat's Athletic.
City will aim to capitalise on home advantage, having played just one of their last seven matches at the Brandywell.
"It's great to be back in the city and hopefully give our fans something to cheer about," added Shiels.
"We've had nine away games in nine weeks and it's been hard on the players, while our next two after this one are also on the road.
"We're going to give them a tough match and we need to have our game heads on from the first whistle."
