Llangennech Welsh school plans backed by councillors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to close two Carmarthenshire schools and replace them with a Welsh-language school have been backed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council's education and children scrutiny committee met on Monday to endorse the closure of Llangennech Infant and Llangennech Junior schools next year.
A new Welsh-medium community primary school would be built in their place.
Carmarthenshire council said the move would ensure "bilingualism is increased" in the area.
Campaigners argue the proposal is taking away parents' choice, as pupils at both schools are currently able to learn in English and Welsh.
A petition to the council said the move would have a "massive impact" on children in the community who seek an English-medium education.
The new Llangennech Community Primary School includes nursery provision and would be built on the existing sites of the current infant and junior schools.
The council's executive will discuss the proposals on 20 June and decide whether to publish a statutory notice.
