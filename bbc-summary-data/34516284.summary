[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish business secretary role called for by small firms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The next Scottish government should appoint a business secretary to represent small firms' interests, according to a lobby group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The call came in a Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) manifesto ahead of the Scottish Parliament election next year.
It said the UK government model separated the roles of chancellor of the exchequer and business secretary and called for Scotland to follow suit.
The Scottish government said it welcomed ideas on economic growth.
The FSB has about 19,000 members in Scotland.
Its Scottish policy convener Andy Willox, said: "Scottish small businesses need an advocate at the top table, distinct from the person who holds the country's purse strings."
The FSB also wants local economies to be treated as a priority, with more investment in communities and better information on how they are performing.
Mr Willox said: "Headline economic statistics suggest that Scotland has made up some ground since the downturn.
"But these figures tell us nothing about the reality of doing business in Portree, the job prospects in Perth or the high street in Paisley.
"If the next administration is committed to a fairer and more prosperous Scotland, they must get under the bonnet of individual communities.
"They must develop new ways to turn around failing places and ensure that local economies aren't perilously dependent on a small number of mobile large employers or industries."
The organisation wants the Scottish public sector to spend 10% of its procurement budget through businesses with fewer than 10 employees by 2021, arguing the move would bring an additional Â£250m into the country's smallest firms every year.
The manifesto also calls for reform of the business rate system, action to improve broadband and mobile coverage, better online services for businesses and financial penalties for public bodies that close local offices and buildings.
Responding to the manifesto, a Scottish government spokesman said: "We welcome and actively consider proposals designed to boost sustainable and inclusive growth across Scotland as a whole.
"These recommendations will feature in our ongoing dialogue with FSB Scotland officials and members, recognising that the Scottish government is already investing in business support, digital infrastructure, and the Small Business Bonus Scheme."
Jackie Baillie, Labour spokeswoman for public services and wealth creation, said: "We recognise how important small business is to the economy of Scotland, and how small business will be at the heart of building a successful Scotland.
"Next year's Scottish Labour manifesto will be the most pro-enterprise ever."
Green MSP Patrick Harvie said: "Scottish Greens want to see a small business revolution. Compared to larger corporations they are more likely to be locally owned, have roots in the community and circulate profits and wages locally.
"All too often what is called the voice of business is the voice of big business; it's time Scotland listened to its SMEs, as they support almost half of all private sector jobs."
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "For years the SNP has completely shunned the business community.
"It has introduced anti-business levies, punishing taxes and placed needless red tape in front of organisations of all sizes.
"The Scottish government should heed the message of this manifesto and do all it can to help grow Scotland's economy."
