Ex-West Bromwich Albion boss Clarke has yet to make a decision on his future and took training at Reading earlier.
The 52-year-old is understood to be Fulham's preferred candidate to replace Kit Symons, who was dismissed from the job at Craven Cottage on 8 November.
Clarke has been at the Madejski Stadium for 11 months and led the club to an FA Cup semi-final last season.
Reading are four points ahead of Fulham in the Championship table.
Clarke was due to speak at his weekly news conference on Thursday, but Reading postponed it until Friday morning.
Reading are without a win in five league games, a run including a 4-2 defeat by Fulham at Craven Cottage on 24 October.
Clarke brought in several new players during the summer transfer window and led Reading to second in the Championship during a five-match unbeaten run.
Fulham, who were relegated from the Premier League in May 2014, are 12th in the table, eight points adrift of the play-off places.
After sacking Symons, Cottagers chairman Shahid Khan said it was time to take the club to a "higher level of success".
"Clarke joined Reading in December 2014 with the club languishing in 17th in the Championship.
"In 50 games, he's won 18 and there's not much doubt what the highlight was, as the Royals reached the last four of the FA Cup in April.
"The issue was just 12 wins in 41 league games at the end of last season.
"Plenty of deals were done in the summer transfer market, bringing in 11 new players and revamping the backroom staff, and the club has been as high as second in the Championship.
"Clarke's tenure of 11 months in charge is the average for a Championship club nowadays."
