[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives are "urgently" seeking the partner of an ex-EastEnders actress, after three bodies were found at the couple's home.

Sian Blake, 43, and the couple's sons, have not been seen at their south-east London home since 13 December.
Three bodies were recovered from the garden in Erith on Tuesday.
The Met has referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission over how the investigation was handled.
In a statement it said "potential issues regarding the handling and grading of the missing persons investigation" had been raised.

It follows the internal Directorate of Professional Standards looking at the "timeline of police interaction with the family".
The force said it spoke to Arthur Simpson-Kent, 48, Ms Blake's partner, on 16 December, but he disappeared three days later.
Police said the possibility he may have left the UK was "one line of inquiry" and he was being sought urgently.
Post-mortem examinations of the three bodies will take place later.
Ms Blake, who has motor neurone disease, played Frankie Pierre in EastEnders between 1996 and 1997.
The actress, whose character broke up the marriage of Alan and Carol Jackson, was last seen with sons Zachary, eight, and Amon, four, in Waltham Forest.
Her car was found on 3 January in Calvert Avenue, Bethnal Green, but it is not yet known how it got there.
Det Supt Paul Monk said: "It's too early to speculate. Our efforts are continuing to find Arthur Simpson-Kent... we do need to speak to him as a matter of urgency."
A 30-year-old neighbour, who did not give her name, said: "She was a lovely, caring lady. I was hoping she was just hiding away to have her last Christmas. I wish I had been a better neighbour. I'm devastated."
A family member had reported the three missing on 16 December with the police speaking to Mr Simpson-Kent that day.
Two days later a missing persons inquiry was launched, but not classed as high risk.
The same day officers returned to the house, and forced their way in when there was no answer. On Monday the homicide team took over.
The Met is also conducting a serious case review, which is standard in all major cases, to look at what lessons can be learned from the investigation.
As well as EastEnders, Ms Blake also appeared in the 1998 film Siberia and TV movie May 33rd in 2004 under her stage name Syan Blake, according to her IMDB profile.
