Ex-Barcelona midfielder Guardiola had a trial with City in the summer of 2005 but then-manager Pearce opted not to sign him.
Guardiola, 45, will replace current City boss Manuel Pellegrini in June.
"If I knew how good he would be as a manager I would have given him my job," Pearce told BBC Radio 5 live.
City, whose squad at the time featured the likes of David James, Trevor Sinclair, Joey Barton and Darius Vassell, finished the 2005-06 Premier League season in 15th place.
"He trained with us for a few days," said Pearce. "He had been playing in the Middle East, and was looking for a contract.
"Smashing fella but, back then, I didn't realise he would be a top manager. We didn't have anything on the playing side but top man, top manager, what an acquisition for City."
Guardiola, who was 34 years old in 2005 and eyeing a return to European football after leaving Al-Ahli in Dubai, had made more than 350 appearances for Barcelona between 1990 and 2001, winning the European Cup and six La Liga titles.
He went on to play briefly for Mexican side Dorados before taking charge of Barcelona B and later Barcelona.
He won 14 trophies in four years at the Nou Camp between 2008 and 2012.  He has since won the Bundesliga twice in two seasons in charge of Bayern Munich.
