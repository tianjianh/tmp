Maureen Quinn and her husband Alexander Malcolm, both 53, were in Queen Street when the tragedy unfolded.
Mr Malcolm threw Bethany's pushchair on to the road as the lorry mounted the pavement and hit pedestrians.
He said his family had been among the "lucky ones". Mrs Quinn said her "heart goes out" to those who lost loved ones.
The tragedy on 22 December last year claimed the lives of six people and saw 15 others injured.
A fatal accident inquiry has been hearing how the council lorry veered out of control when the driver, Harry Clarke, 58, blacked out at the wheel.
Speaking to BBC Scotland reporter Catriona Renton, Mrs Quinn said she had been looking after her two-year-old granddaughter that day and met her husband in central Glasgow.
They decided to go through George Square where the Glasgow Christmas Festival was taking place.
Shortly after crossing into Queen Street, they saw the bin lorry coming towards them.
Mrs Quinn recalled: "It was actually the speed of it that you knew there was something wrong."
She said her husband thought it was a terrorist attack and told her: "He's (the driver) not stopping."
Mrs Quinn said the couple had "nowhere to go" as the lorry mounted the pavement.
The next thing she remembers is how her husband picked up the buggy their granddaughter was in and "threw Bethany on to the middle of the road" before doing likewise with her. The pushchair landed upside down.
Mrs Quinn recalls the bin lorry going past and holding her granddaughter in her arms after she had come out of the buggy.
She was then helped to her feet by a passer-by.
Mrs Quinn added: "My only thought was to save Bethany. I don't remember much else that was going on round about but I just had to save Bethany. That was all that mattered."
Mr Malcolm said the incident "happened so fast" but his family "were the lucky ones".
The couple sustained minor injuries and took Bethany to Yorkhill Sick Kids Hospital after noticing that she had a bruised eye.
They did not feel their own injuries warranted staying behind for an ambulance as there were so many others in a worse state.
Mr Malcolm recalled that they hastily left the scene of the tragedy, operating on "adrenalin".
The couple said their granddaughter had recovered well but is afraid of bin lorries if she sees them in the street.
Mrs Quinn added: "My heart goes out to the people who lost someone in the tragedy. It must have been horrific for them."
