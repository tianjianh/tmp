Tell America it's great? 'That is so Canadian'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everyone needs a pick-me-up sometimes, and in the midst of a divisive election campaign the US might need it more than most.

Luckily for world-weary Americans, some light relief is on hand thanks to their northern neighbours in Canada.
Toronto-based creative agency The Garden has been asking fellow Canadians to help Americans, regardless of their political affiliations, through election season by sharing supportive messages on YouTube and Twitter, using the hashtag #TellAmericaItsGreat.
A compilation video the agency put together has racked up almost half a million views on YouTube.
In a blog post, the agency said: "It's no secret that America is going through a hard time right now.
"They've been bombarded with a tremendous amount of negativity, and it's likely that for many of them, the immediate future seems rather bleak."
A founder of the agency, Shari Walczak, told the New York Times that she and her co-workers had friends, family and colleagues who lived in the United States.
"Every morning we would come together at work, and there would inevitably be a discussion about another negative piece of news about the election," she said.
"We realised they are immersed in it day in and day out and how awful that must feel."
Thousands have chipped in on social media to throw admiring glances in America's direction.
Some were keen to highlight the history-making side of the US.
While others were more impressed by America's cultural footprint.
All this affection just left some Americans wanting to tell Canada they are the best ever and they love them.
Thanks for being you, Canada.
