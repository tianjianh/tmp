Returning top-scorer Martyn Waghorn has played himself into Scottish Cup final contention after finally making his comeback from injury with Rangers.

The 28-goal striker spent 11 weeks on the sidelines with a knee injury.
But he managed to play an hour after starting in a 2-2 draw with St Mirren in the Championship title winners' final league game.
Manager Mark Warburton said: "He has a chance of starting. He has worked hard and looked really fit."
Waghorn has been sidelined since picking up a knee injury in the 2-1 quarter-final win over Kilmarnock on 16 February.
"He looked as if he hadn't been away," said Warburton. "There was no rustiness to speak of on a difficult surface and I thought he was very good.
"He has made a good case for selection.
"It is all credit to him and the physios for the work that has been done.
"He has come back, is fit, hungry, sharp and you can see that he wants to play."
Cup final opponents Hibernian finished third behind Rangers and Falkirk in the Championship and could have played three gruelling promotion play-off ties by the time the teams meet at Hampden on 21 May.
Rangers have arranged an 11 May closed-doors friendly with Tottenham Hotspur to help keep them match fit before then and Warburton plans to give Waghorn another chance then to increase his sharpness.
The draw in Paisley means Rangers have failed to win in four outings since beating Celtic in the cup semi-final, but Warburton was not concerned about their dip in form.
"I was delighted with the second half," he said. "The pitch was dry and difficult for both teams, but the lads were brave on the ball, we had runners, created chances and hit the woodwork.
"It's just a shame the 92nd-minute equaliser dampened things a bit.
"That was the reaction I wanted after the Livingston game. We had lots of good things."
Meanwhile, Warburton played down being linked with Everton should the English Premier League club dispense with manager Roberto Martinez.
"Who is it this time?" he joked. "It will be Barcelona and Real Madrid next."
