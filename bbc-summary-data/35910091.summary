Louise James's partner, two sons, mother and sister died when their car slid off Buncrana pier and entered Lough Swilly on 20 March.
Ms James, along with family members and witnesses, took part in a ceremony held close to the pier on Sunday.
Vigils were also held in Strathfoyle and the Guildhall in Londonderry.
Four-month old Rionaghac-Ann was the only survivor.
She was rescued by passer-by Davitt Walsh after the car slipped into the water.
Louise James spoke briefly at the ceremony, expressing her gratitude to "everybody for your words of support, kindness, generosity, everything".
"Thank you so much," she added.
Ms James, along with her four-month-old daughter, sat beside Francis and Kay Crawford who had raised the alarm last Sunday night.
Local parish priest Father Francis Bradley said Louise James had shown courage.
"She has exhibited tremendous strength and dignity over the past week, especially at her home during the wake and the funeral mass," he said.
"For somebody who is naturally shy it is not an easy thing to do but she just feels the need to thank people for their kindness."
Five floral tributes were set afloat on the sea in memory of the five loved ones she lost.
A locked gate now blocks access from the pier area and warning signs have been erected.
Hundreds of mourners lined streets in Londonderry on Thursday as hearses carrying the five victims made their way to Holy Family Church for the funeral service.
Jim McGrotty, a brother of Sean, said his brother's efforts to save his family had been the ultimate display of his love for them.
"Sean's love for his family was proven, if proof was ever needed, with his selfless actions on last Sunday evening," he said.
In Derry, people came together at Guildhall Square to show their support.
There was a minute's silence as the Guildhall clock struck seven.
