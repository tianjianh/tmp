The move will bring its total number of shops north of the border to 72.
Aldi said that by the end of this year it will employ about 2,500 people in Scotland - an increase of 200% since 2012.
In the UK as a whole, Aldi plans to hire 5,000 more staff this year and open 80 new stores.
Planned store locations in Scotland:
• Annan, Dumfries and Galloway
• Polmont, near Falkirk
• Fruitmarket Place, Edinburgh
• Portobello, Edinburgh
• Cornhill, Aberdeen
• Strathaven, South Lanarkshire
• Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire
• Auldhouse Retail Park, Glasgow
The company also said it planned to continue growing its range of Scottish-sourced products, having increased the number of Scottish lines by 30% since 2013.
In the past year it has signed a number of large supplier deals, including a £250,000 contract with Montrose-based Stirfresh to supply fresh ready-to-cook vegetables and a six-figure deal with Dean's of Huntly to supply stores across the country with shortbread and oat biscuit selections.
Richard Holloway, managing director of Aldi in Scotland, said: "Our business model in Scotland has always been about working with the best local producers to bring top quality products to our customers at everyday low prices.
"In the year ahead, we want to grow relationships with existing suppliers and cultivate new ones too."
