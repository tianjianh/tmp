Nouri, 20, suffered "cardiac arrhythmias" - heart rhythm problems - against Werder Bremen on Saturday.
On Monday, Ajax said tests showed his "heart is functioning normally".
A brain scan since has not detected "any anomalies" and the Dutch club said more detailed testing will be carried out when he is conscious.
The Amsterdam-born player is in hospital in Austria - where the friendly was played - and is expected to be out of the coma in the next 24 hours.
He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in Innsbruck after his collapse and on Sunday, the 33-time Dutch champions said the Moroccan was "out of danger".
Nouri played 15 league and cup games for Ajax in 2016-17, scoring one goal in a Dutch Cup tie.
