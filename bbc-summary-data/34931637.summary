Tidal project to link Workington with Kirkcudbright

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been drawn up for a multi-million pound tidal energy project which would link the south-west of Scotland with Cumbria.

The proposal would also see a road run across a "tidal gateway" connecting Dumfries and Galloway with Workington.
It is part of a project which could see similar structures built across six estuaries in the north-west of England.
North West Energy Squared (NWE2) claim it would generate power, improve transport links and create jobs.
Chairman Alan Torevell said the entire project could generate enough affordable "green energy" to power more than five million homes for 120 years.
He estimated that the construction period could provide at least 20,000 new jobs and the transport links would boost the regional economy.
If the firm can secure financial backing, tidal gateways across Morcambe Bay and the Dudden Estuary are likely to form the first part of the project.
Construction work across the Solway would begin in around 2022, Mr Torevell estimated.
Turbines which harness the power of the tide would be built into a crossing from Workington to a location "south of Kirkcudbright".
The Â£12bn project would improve transport links to the port of Cairnryan from the north of England.
NWE2 claims vehicles travelling across the gateway would cut their journey between Workington and Stranraer from 137 miles to 67 miles.
Mr Torevell said the Solway crossing was a crucial element of the project.
"The Solway part of it, in terms of electricity production part of it, is the most important part," he added.
"We would produce probably 50% more electricity from that - maybe 12 million MW/hrs a year.
"It has the least positive impact on the local economy and the impact on transport improvements simply because the number of people going across the Solway towards the port of Cairnryan is fewer than the number of people potentially going across Morcambe Bay."
He said the project team has received "considerable public support" for the plans which have been displayed across the north-west of England.
