A shortbread version of Grayson Perry's "A House for Essex" has been named the winner of a baking competition.

The structure was one of the entries for the "edible masterpieces" challenge at Norwich Castle.
Its creator, Alison Newbery, 28, said she had been inspired by artist Perry's building in Wrabness, Essex.
"It took me about 14 hours to make, which was longer than I thought. But I did take a break to watch the Great British Bake Off final," she said.
The challenge was started by charity Art Fund, which supports museums and galleries across the country.
Miss Newbery, who works as an administration and finance officer at Norwich Castle, said she and her colleagues had been inspired by the BBC One baking series, which finished this week.
Norfolk Museum's head of service acted as the competition's own Mary Berry and declared Miss Newbery's biscuit creation the winner.
The BBC has contacted Perry to see what he made of the cake, but he is yet to respond.
Miss Newbery said she had grown up in north Essex, near the site of Perry's art work, and thought it would be the easiest of his creations to try to render in biscuit form.
Organisers said a "big favourite" was an edible version of Norwich Castle, which included cake at the bottom and top, and contained 16 eggs.
Another baker made a model of Kings Lynn town hall out of marzipan, while someone else created a cake covered in sugar work brooches, inspired by Norfolk finds in the museum's collection.
Miss Newbery said all the money raised during the bake sale would go to Art Fund and the museum.
She said the competition had left all the participants feeling "very happy and slightly high on sugar".
