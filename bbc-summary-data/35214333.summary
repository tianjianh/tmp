Murray Wallace: Scunthorpe sign Huddersfield Town defender

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scunthorpe United have signed Huddersfield Town defender Murray Wallace for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old Scot played 13 times on loan at the Iron this season and has agreed a three-and-a-half-year deal.
Having been a youth player at Glasgow Rangers, he moved to Falkirk where he became a professional in 2011.
He signed for Huddersfield in January 2012 in a Â£300,000 deal and made 60 appearances, but fell out of favour this season, playing just three times.
