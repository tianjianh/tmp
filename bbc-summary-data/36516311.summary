[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey picked up their first win of the season in the One-Day Cup as they beat Sussex by six wickets in a rain-affected match at Guildford.

The bad weather reduced Sussex's innings to 45 overs and after slipping to 100-5, Chris Jordan (55) and David Wiese (41) pushed them to 239 all out.
Chasing 235 in 43 overs, Surrey eased home despite a mid-innings wobble.
Rory Burns made 70 not out and Ben Foakes an unbeaten 61 as Surrey reached 235-4 with nearly 10 overs to spare.
Jason Roy (32) and Steven Davies (36) had put on 65 for the first wicket to give Surrey a solid start, but both fell to George Garton (2-66).
Ajmal Shahzad (2-34) got rid of Kumar Sangakkara (20) and Zafar Ansari for a golden duck as the home side slipped to 99-4.
But an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 136 in 111 balls between Burns and Foakes ended Surrey's run of two successive defeats in the South Group.
Sussex sit second from bottom with one win from four games.
