A number of families in Castlefin have also moved out of their homes.
Patients have been moved from the Castelfin surgery to its sister surgery in Lifford.
Dr Martin Coin, the GP for both surgeries, said Storm Desmond "has caused havoc". "We are dealing with an extra 200 patients now in Lifford because of the closure," he saidd
"The car park is crowded every day but we are trying to manage.
"The HSE is trying to get port cabins for us but everything takes time.
"So many things need replaced because of contamination. It will more thank likely be months rather than weeks before we are up and running again.
Stephen Kennedy, from the Castlefin Partnership Initiative, said "people are trying to rebuild their businesses again".
"People are trying to get on with things but it's awful that people have to travel so far to see their GP though.
"A number of families will have to spend Christmas out of their homes. They had up to 3ft of water inside their houses.
"Some people have gone to stay with family. Others have moved in to rented accommodation.
"The CPI centre had flooding issues before. We were working on that but Storm Desmond disrupted things.
"The surge of water was unbelievable."
The Health and Safety Executive said the Castlefin centre was flooded on Sunday 15 November and subsequently flooded again on 5 December.
It said the suitability of alternative accommodation was being assessed, with a "view to agreeing on the most appropriate interim accommodation".
"It is anticipated that the primary care centre will be reinstated within a time frame of five to six months provided there are no unforeseen difficulties that would delay the re-occupation of the property."
