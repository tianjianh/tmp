More than 600 football tops have been donated by UK fans to homeless people in Africa, Asia and South America as part of a shirt "amnesty".

The National Football Museum in Manchester invited supporters last summer to donate old shirts for the charity Street Child United.
BBC Sport commentator Guy Mowbray gave 26 tops while Scotland boss Gordon Strachan also donated shirts.
The museum has launched another amnesty this summer for the charity Kit Aid.
John Wroe, chief executive of Street Child United, said the donations were "a brilliant reminder of the power of the kindness of strangers and of football".
"A change of clothes is a rare option for street children. The closest some street children get to a 'wardrobe' is a plastic bag stuffed up a tall tree and carefully hidden from view."
The most donated shirts were of Manchester City, England, Blackburn Rovers, Manchester United and Liverpool.
Shirts from more than 80 clubs were handed over, as well as kits from Sunday league clubs.
This year's amnesty runs until 31 August.
