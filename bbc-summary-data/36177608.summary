[SN]TITLE[SN]
CCTV monitoring deal in Rhyl, Prestatyn and Rhuddlan agreed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 12-month "trial" partnership will take over the monitoring of Denbighshire council's town centre CCTV system.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It had planned to scrap monitoring footage to save Â£200,000 a year.
But now the council, North Wales Police and Rhyl, Prestatyn and Rhuddlan town councils will pay for it to continue.
There are 81 cameras located across the three towns, together with a small number on council land and buildings.
They are all linked to a control room in Rhyl police station.
Graham Boase, Denbighshire's head of planning and public protection, said: "We recognised the need to potentially have some kind of alternative provision.
"I'm confident we can work together over the next 12 months to look at developing the partnership so that the arrangements can become permanent."
