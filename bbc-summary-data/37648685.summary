A judge has signed a criminal summons accusing New Jersey Governor Chris Christie of misconduct for his alleged role in the 2013 closure of a bridge.

The case will move to the Bergen County Prosecutor's office to determine whether an indictment will follow.
The news comes as two former Christie aides are on trial for allegedly closing part of the bridge after a mayor refused to endorse the governor.
The Republican governor has repeatedly denied knowing about the lane closures.

Former aides Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni are facing conspiracy and fraud charges for allegedly closing part of the George Washington Bridge, a major bridge connecting New Jersey to New York City.
The move was allegedly political retribution for Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich's decision not to endorse the governor in his re-election bid.
David Wildstein, who pleaded guilty last year, testified late last month that Mr Christie was told about the bridge closure at a 9/11 memorial service two days after the lanes were blocked and laughed about the revenge plot.
Activist Bill Brennan filed the official misconduct complaint against Mr Christie in September after Mr Wildstein's testimony.
The prosecutor's office will decide whether there is enough evidence to indict Mr Christie for official misconduct, which could lead to a sentence of five to 10 years in prison.
Mr Christie appointed the prosecutor who will review the case.
The governor's spokesman told the AP news agency the ruling is being appealed and reiterated Mr Christie had no knowledge of the plot.
