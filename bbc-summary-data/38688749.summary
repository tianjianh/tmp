First fall in home-movers for five years, Lloyds says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of Britons moving home last year fell for the first time in five years, according to Lloyds Bank.

In total, 354,000 UK households sold up and bought elsewhere, 4% fewer than in 2015.
The bank said that was the first annual decline since 2011, after four successive years of growth.
One reason was the rise in prices. Home-movers had to pay an average of £291,777 for their new property, 7% more than in 2015.
In parts of southern England anyone moving house had to put down an average deposit of more than £100,000.
During 2016 two estate agents issued profit warnings as a result of falling sales.
Foxtons reported a 42% fall in profits in July, blaming uncertainty following the EU referendum and a slowing of the market in central London.
And Countrywide, which owns 55 High Street estate agents, said in November that it expected transactions to fall by 6% over the year.
Lloyds Bank mortgages director Andrew Mason said the number of people moving home was important, as it increases the supply of properties in the market - particularly for first-time buyers.
Lloyds calculated its own estimates for 2016, and compared them with historic data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders.
