Arlene Arkinson: Social services 'alerted police to murder suspect', inquest hears

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Social services alerted police to a possible relationship between County Tyrone schoolgirl Arlene Arkinson and the man suspected of killing her, a coroner's court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police notes read out revealed a social worker had confirmed the pair were at least known to each other - a few days after she went missing in August 1994.
Arlene, 15 from Castlederg went missing after a night out at a disco in County Donegal in 1994.
Her body has never been found.
Det Con Gareth Jenkins told the inquest in Belfast that the Omagh-based social worker had confirmed that a "relationship existed".
He added: "What sort of relationship that was, without having anything written down, it would be unfair to comment further."
She was last seen with convicted child killer Robert Howard, who died in prison last year.
Howard was acquitted of Arlene's murder by a jury unaware of his long record of sex crimes, including the murder of a south London schoolgirl. He always remained the police's prime suspect in Arlene's death.
Howard, 71, had been due to give evidence before the inquest.  He died at HMP Frankland in County Durham last October.
The court also heard that social services found Arlene had a poor attendance at school, was a smoker and drinker who did not go anywhere without make-up or money and who "looked about 19 years old".
There was also a brief mention of a "relationship" with a second older man.
At the time she was living with her brother, Martin Arkinson, in Castlederg and had, on occasion, gone missing, staying with her father or another relative. However, she had always made contact within 48 hours.
After two days family members told social services that Arlene was missing, but it took two more days before police were informed, the court heard.
The initial missing person investigation had two main lines of inquiry - that Arlene had travelled to Birmingham to obtain an abortion or that Howard was involved.
Although he was aware Howard had been on bail for serious sexual offences, Mr Jenkins said he was unsure whether he was still signing bail when the schoolgirl vanished.
"It was not a criminal investigation at this stage where I had taken my initial answers," he said. "It was not solely focused on Robert Howard. It also focused on the possible travel to England."
The police investigation was heavily scrutinised during Howard's trial.
Mr Jenkins said he had done everything possible but, as a junior officer, could not decide the course of an investigation.
"I had raised my concerns about irregularities in the accounts that the three or four people had given," he said.
Meanwhile, the court has heard harrowing details about an alleged sex attack carried out by Howard.
"I was terrified," said the victim in a statement read out to the court.
In another development, the coroner has requested further clarification on the public interest immunity application request by the Police Service of Northern Ireland to withhold a number of confidential documents.
Another behind-closed-doors hearing may take place on Friday to discuss the matter but this has not been confirmed.
The inquest has been adjourned until next week.
