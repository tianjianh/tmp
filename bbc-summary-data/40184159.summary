Chris Coleman's side are four points behind both group leaders Serbia and second-placed Republic of Ireland with five World Cup qualifiers remaining.
Wales will be without Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale for Sunday's game in Belgrade due to suspension.
"We have shown in the past in big games we can go and win matches people think we probably can't," Gunter said.
"We are in a situation where we have to go to Serbia and perform and pick something up.
"If we go and play as we have done over the course of the last two to three years, we give ourselves a really good chance."
Wales began their campaign with victory over Moldova but are third in Group D after drawing against Austria, Georgia, Serbia and the Republic of Ireland.
"It's been a strange group in terms of we haven't done a lot wrong but we probably feel we could have a couple more points," Gunter told BBC Wales Sport.
"At the start of a group you know to qualify you need to put a run of wins together and we haven't done that in the first-half but it doesn't mean you can't in the second half of the group.
"We come away from Serbia with something and we are right in the group with the games we have left to play."
Newport-born Gunter, who made his senior international debut against New Zealand in May 2007, is set to win his 79th cap in Serbia.
Defender James Collins and midfielder Andy King are out injured while Real Madrid's Bale and defender Neil Taylor of Aston Villa miss the game through suspension.
Bale, 27, will miss his first competitive Wales since October 2013 but Gunter believes they can cope without their talisman.
"You always want your best eleven out but we have shown in the past we have been able to manage," Gunter said.
"We have some really good players ready to come whatever way the manager wants to go."
