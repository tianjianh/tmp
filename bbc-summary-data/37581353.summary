Mimmi Larsson's powerful headed goal in the second half proved decisive.
Chances were at a premium in an evenly fought affair at the Tunavallen Stadium.
Hayley Lauder and Haley Rosen came closest to finding a leveller for the visitors, but City could not find an important away goal.
They will take heart from having matched their Swedish opponents for long spells in the match, however, and will feel they can turn around the one goal deficit in next Thursday's second leg at Airdrie's Excelsior Stadium.
Glasgow City manager Scott Booth: "We knew it was going to be a tough first leg here in Sweden, but we feel we did our homework well and put into practice a game plan that has kept us in this tie.
"The players worked extremely hard but we know we need to do the same in the second-leg as well as taking a couple of chances to get us through."
