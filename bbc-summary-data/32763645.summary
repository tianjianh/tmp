A 150-year-old pub is set to reopen after a lease was secured to refurbish the building.

The Chesham Arms Pub will start trading next month after a two-year legal battle by the Save The Chesham group.
Hackney Council granted the pub further planning protection after the group objected to the owner's unauthorised plan to turn the Mehetabel Lane pub into a residential property.
Campaigners said they were "delighted" at the news the pub would be reopening.
Jonathan Sockett, chairman of Save The Chesham, said: "We are delighted that a pub built when these streets were first laid out around 150 years ago can now continue to provide a warm welcome to local people for decades to come."
The group said local publican Andy Bird had signed a 15-year lease to reopen the venue.
In 2014, Hackney Council granted the pub "Asset of Community Value" status, after the owner continued with plans to turn part of the building into a flat without planning permission.
In March, an Article 4 direction was also made on the pub, which meant the building could not be changed into a shop, or financial services office.
Councillor Guy Nicholson, from Hackney Council, said: "With a new publican now on-board, the treasured historic local landmark will once again open its doors to residents and visitors from across London."
