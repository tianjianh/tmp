Langworth freight train derailment: 'Heat could be factor'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The current heat wave could have been a factor in the derailment of a freight train in Lincolnshire, Network Rail has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Up to eight wagons were derailed near Station Road level crossing at Langworth on Tuesday.
The line between Lincoln, Market Rasen and Grimsby will remain closed until Friday to allow for recovery work.
No-one was injured during the incident and an investigation is now under way to determine the cause.
Network Rail said it had not ruled out the possibility of the heat being a factor, as on hot days rails in direct sunshine can reach temperatures of 20 degrees centigrade above air temperature, which can cause the steel rails to expand.
Although fitted with expansion joints, in extreme heat the rails can buckle.
It is monitoring track temperatures and has put speed restrictions in place, meaning there is less pressure on the rails.
Sprinkler systems and painted rails which absorb less heat are also in use at key junctions on the network.
On the possible cause of the Langworth derailment, Toby Higgins, from the firm, said: "The weather is one of a number of potential causes - but that's what we hope the investigation will determine."
A replacement bus service is in operation on the service, which is operated by East Midlands Trains.
Passengers can use Stagecoach buses on route 53 between Lincoln and Grimsby.
