Dale took the lead against the run of play just before half-time when Ashley Eastham headed in from Donal McDermott's cross.
Joe Bunney turned in Rochdale's second from close range after the visitors had failed to clear a corner.
And Nathaniel Mendez-Laing slotted home to seal the win and extend Dale's unbeaten run to three games.
The result leaves Keith Hill's side eighth in the table, four points outside the play-off places, while Blackpool are two points adrift of safety in 21st.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"I'm pleased with the player's application and attitude. These games now aren't about technical ability or tactics, this is about endeavour pride and sacrifice and putting everything into a game.
"At this time of the season, whether you're fighting relegation or trying to get promoted, that's all it's about - heart.
"Results are important not performances, but in the second half I thought we put in an excellent performance."
