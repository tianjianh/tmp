Age Cymru, Age Alliance Wales and Woody's Lodge secured the funding from the Aged Veterans Fund.
They will work together on Project 360° to tackle issues including isolation, loneliness, health and wellbeing.
The project will run for three years, aiming to support more than 10,000 veterans.
Woody's Lodge is a centre in HMS Cambria in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, for armed forces and emergency services veterans.
It provides veterans with access to charities, advice, counselling and a place to socialise with other veterans.
Project 360° hopes to open a similar base in north Wales.
David Trottman, from Woody's Lodge, said: "This is a very exciting development and it will allow us to reach out to and help even more veterans by giving them access to potentially life-changing services."
Ian Thomas, chief executive of Age Cymru, said the £1m funding put the project in "a unique position to make a real difference to the lives of older veterans in Wales".
