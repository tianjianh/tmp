The body has yet to be identified and a post mortem will be carried out to determine the cause of death.
The man's body was discovered by volunteers searching for missing Newtownabbey man Dean McIlwaine.
Mr McIlwaine was last seen in the Carnmoney Road area of Newtownabbey in County Antrim on Thursday 13 July.
PSNI Superintendent Emma Bond said: "Police have been working alongside community search teams and members of the public in an effort to find Dean McIlwaine.
"Although the PSNI were not part of the Cavehill search party, we were aware it was taking place and had spoken to the organiser.
"Today, as part of our ongoing investigation, we carried out a number of other searches in the area for Dean," she added.
The 22-year-old barber's parents made an emotional plea for him to come home on Thursday.
Police had carried out extensive searches for him and also released CCTV footage taken on the day he went missing as they appealed for information on his whereabouts.
