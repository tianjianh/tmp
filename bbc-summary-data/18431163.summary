Euro 2012: Russia punished for a third time for their fans' behaviour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russia have been punished for a third time for the behaviour of their supporters during Euro 2012.

The latest incident is for "the setting off and throwing of fireworks by spectators, and displaying of illicit banners" in their final Group A match against Greece on 16 June.
The Russian Football Union has been fined £28,000 for the incidents in the game, which Russia lost 1-0.
Russia had already been punished for incidents at both their previous games.
The Russian Football Union was fined £24,300 for the behaviour of their fans during their 1-1 draw with Poland in which fireworks were let off, "illicit" banners were displayed and the pitch invaded.
That game in Warsaw on 12 June was also marred by clashes between opposing fans.
Uefa had already given Russia a suspended six-point deduction for their fans' actions in their 4-1 win against Czech Republic in their opening group game.
A Uefa statement at the time read: "The Football Union of Russia (RFS) has been fined 30,000 euros for the setting off and throwing of fireworks by spectators, displaying of illicit banners and the invasion of the pitch by a supporter at last week's Uefa Euro 2012 Group A match against Poland in Warsaw.
"The case in question and decision do not have any impact on the probation period for the sanction imposed on the RFS following the incidents at their first match against the Czech Republic in Wroclaw."
Russia were punished for supporters' use of fireworks and display of far-right banners in the victory over the Czechs.
The penalty was suspended for three-and-a-half years and would apply to Euro 2016 qualifying in the event of further breaches. It also included a fine of £96,000 (120,000 euros).
The Russian Football Union said it would do all it could to avoid being "subjected to this severe punishment".
