The world's first eye-tracking virtual reality headset has secured investment from Samsung Ventures.

The Fove headset lets users focus on specific areas of a scene and aim computer game weapons using just their eyes.
The device reached its crowdfunding target back in May, just 72 hours after its campaign was launched.
Fove said it would use the extra investment from Samsung Ventures to add extra functionality to the product.
The company had promised to look at integrating Valve's Lighthouse technology, to accurately track the headset's position, if it reached $700,000 in funding.
The BBC understands the extra investment means Fove has exceeded that goal.
Ik Hyun Lim, head of Samsung Ventures Japan, said: "We believe Fove will launch a competitive VR device in the market soon."
Fove said it hoped to send early units to software developers in spring 2016.
