Antrim's Matthew Fitzpatrick wins his appeal against 48-week ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim's Matthew Fitzpatrick will be able to play in Sunday's Championship match away to Donegal after winning his appeal against a 48-week ban.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fitzpatrick had been suspended on Monday when the GAA's Central Hearings Committee ruled he had misled a recent disciplinary hearing.
However, when the player's appeal was heard on Wednesday night, that verdict was overturned.
He is available to play in Sunday's Ulster Football Championship fixture.
Fitzpatrick had originally been banned for one match following an incident during a Division Three Football League game against Armagh in March.
Fresh video evidence then emerged which led to Fitzpatrick being handed the lengthy suspension.
The news will be a relief to Antrim joint-manager Gearoid Adams who feared Fitzpatrick might quit the game.
Antrim's Conor Murray will miss the match at Ballybofey because of a two-match ban imposed following his red card in the game against Armagh.
