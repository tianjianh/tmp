The remains were found in bushes in Manor Park, Church Hill, in Aldershot on Friday.
Hampshire Constabulary said the little girl had been named Baby M after being found in Manor Park in the month of May.
A memorial service for the child was held in the park at 18:30 BST on Sunday.
More on this and other stories from across the South of England.
No more details have been confirmed about the baby.
Concern continues for the welfare of the child's mother who, police say, may need "urgent medical attention".
Ch Insp Debbie Brooks said: "Our primary objective is the safety and the wellbeing of the mother of this little baby girl."
The force has appealed to any friends, relatives or healthcare workers with information to come forward.
David Shepherd, of Hope Pentecostal Church, Farnborough, led the service in the park and said there had been an "outpouring" of grief from the community.
"We want to reach out to the mother, who probably is feeling very vulnerable, there is hope somehow that we can reach out to her."
A post-mortem examination has taken place, but no details of how Baby M died have been released.
