The stumbling Division Two promotion hopefuls have turned to Cummins after Abbott was called into South Africa's Test squad for their current two-Test series against New Zealand.
Barbados-born Cummins, 25, is scheduled to arrive on Monday.
He is expected to play in the games against Essex, Sussex and Derbyshire.
"He is a young guy with no experience of county cricket or English conditions," said Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes, who signed him on the recommendation of England bowling coach Ottis Gibson, the former Glamorgan, Leicestershire, Durham and West Indies fast bowler.
"He's a little bit quicker than any of our bowlers, with a bit of bounce. I spoke to Ottis and he gave a very good recommendation.
"When you look to give someone an opportunity, you want someone with a point to prove. There is a lot of unavailability towards the end of the season and we're lucky to get Miguel."
Cummins, who has taken 125 first-class wickets in 44 matches at an average of 22.44, made his Test debut in the recent series against India and picked up nine wickets on his second appearance, including a second-innings haul of 6-48.
Worcestershire have twice before signed West Indies fast bowlers for late-season stints - Kemar Roach in 2012 and Shannon Gabriel in 2015.
