A bomb has ripped through central Bangkok close to the Erawan Shrine killing at least 21 people. Here is what we know about the incident so far.

At about 19:00 local time (12:00 GMT) an improvised explosive device detonated inside the Erawan Shrine in central Bangkok.
Thai police say it was a pipe bomb - 3kg (6.5lb) of TNT stuffed into a pipe and wrapped with white cloth, according to the Bangkok Post.
The explosions killed at least 21 people, according to officials, 12 of whom died at the scene. More than 120 people have been injured.
Correspondents describe a site of utter carnage with body parts  strewn across the area as well as broken glass and burned out vehicles.
Bomb disposal units checked two suspicious objects but found no other bombs.
The shrine, built to bring good fortune to the five-star hotel next door, is dedicated to the Hindu creation god, Brahma, but it is popular with Thai Buddhists too.
Thousands of people, including tourists, visit it every day, and Thais will often stop for a brief prayer as they pass by, at any time of the day.
Why do people visit the Erawan shrine?
The capital is no stranger to unrest and has seen small bombs before, during the years of tussling between political factions. But it has never seen an attack on this scale.
The Ratchaprasong intersection where the blast occurred has been the location of mass political protests in recent years and has been targeted before.
In February, two bombs exploded on the Ratchaprasong Skywalk outside the Siam Paragon shopping mall injuring two people.
Those were politically motivated according to the Bangkok Post newspaper, but it is still not known who was behind the attack.
No-one has  said they carried out this attack yet, but the government has said it was clearly designed to hit foreigners and Thailand's vital tourist trade.
The BBC's Jonathan Head in the city says there is no shortage of potential suspects.
Some will point fingers at Islamist insurgents who have for years been fighting for an independent state in the south of Thailand, he says, but they carry out small-scale attacks in the south. They have never perpetrated an attack outside the area, nor have they targeted tourists.
The army chief has said the attack does not match the tactics used by the insurgents.
Others, says our correspondent, will blame the recent political violence in Thailand.
Thailand is deeply divided between supporters of the Shinawatra family, mainly rural farmers, and the Bangkok elite that accuses them of corruption.
After months of unrest that sometimes erupted into violence on the streets, the military took control last May.
This has outraged supporters of Thaksin Shinawatra - a former prime minister -whose sister Yingluck Shinawatra was heading the democratically-elected government that was ousted.
