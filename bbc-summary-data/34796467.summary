The memorial event will be attended by hundreds of firefighters, police officers, paramedics and volunteers in a chapel overlooking the crash site.
Emergency workers and community leaders have organised the 22 November service.
It will come three months after a jet crashed on to the West Sussex A27 during the Shoreham Air Show.
The Right Rev Dr Martin Warner will open the service at Lancing College with a prayer for the victims.
He said it would be an important moment for people who were caught up in the "sudden and tragic events" of that day.
The names of the victims will be read out ahead of a minute's silence at 13:22 GMT - the exact time of the crash.
Each family will then light a candle to be placed on the chapel's altar.
The relatives affected will also give the readings.
Personal reflections of the rescue effort have been written and compiled and will be read out by Sussex Police Chief Constable Giles York, West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service Chief Fire Officer Sean Ruth, and South East Coast Ambulance Service chief executive Paul Sutton.
Two days after the crash, Assistant Chief Constable Steve Barry said he had  never before in his career seen anything like the Shoreham crash, in terms of its scale, tragedy and impact on the local community.
Friends and relatives gathered for the funeral of retired engineer Graham Mallinson at St Mary's Church, Newick, on Thursday,
The keen photographer had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber, which was making one of its last appearances at the air show, when the vintage Hawker Hunter jet crashed.
He was described as being a "very dearly loved" husband, father and brother who would be "very sorely missed".
