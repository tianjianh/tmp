Leyton Orient 1-3 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ricardo Santos scored his first Barnet goals as they moved into the League Two play-off places with victory at Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Portuguese defender's quick-fire brace put the Bees in control at Brisbane Road before Curtis Weston sealed the points in added time after Paul McCallum had halved the deficit.
Santos, a recent signing from Peterborough, seized on a fumble by O's goalkeeper Alex Cisak to break the deadlock from close range in the 63rd minute and he doubled the advantage three minutes later following good work from Nana Kyei.
McCallum gave the O's a lifeline when he powerfully headed in a Callum Kennedy corner with 10 minutes remaining but Weston guaranteed the three points when he crashed the ball into an empty net after a lob from substitute Jamal Campbell-Ryce rebounded off the crossbar.
Although the teams went into the interval all-square, the visitors should have been well ahead having missed five clear chances, and leading scorer John Akinde was the main culprit for their profligacy.
His best chance came after just four minutes when he stabbed wide from close range with the goal at his mercy.
Fellow striker Simeon Akinola spurned two straight-forward chances set up by Akinde as the home side struggled to contain the Bees' attacking threat.
However, an incisive display after the break deservedly earned the visitors their sixth victory in eight matches.
