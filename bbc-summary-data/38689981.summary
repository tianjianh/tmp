Two terrapins found abandoned before Christmas in a Tupperware container are looking for a new home after spending a month with the Scottish SPCA.

The charity said the terrapins, which staff have named Jingle and Bell, were dumped near Muirton Place in Dundee on 17 December.
The turtles are being cared for at the charity's centre in the city.
Centre Assistant manager Dale Christie said: "Both Jingle and Bell are quite small and can be handled.
"They appear to be in relatively good nick, apart from some knocks to their shell.
"They're lovely little guys and we'd love for them to find a loving home after coming to us after being through such an ordeal."
