It follows Port Talbot Town FC's suspension of midfielder Daniel Thomas, 28, on Wednesday.
It is widely reported to have followed a homophobic message sent to Daley's Twitter page.
Club officials said on Wednesday that Mr Thomas had been the victim of a "misguided prank" after leaving his phone unattended.
Port Talbot chairman Andrew Edwards confirmed the player had been arrested by police and released on bail.
"He [Mr Thomas] was called in by police and arrested yesterday [Wednesday] and is on conditional bail," he said.
"It will be some time next week so, pending the police investigation, he's still under suspension.
"We've taken legal advice and, when the police inquiry is concluded, we will deal with it from then."
Both the club and Mr Thomas have apologised "unreservedly" and said they in no way condoned the views in the tweet.
In a statement, police said they had "arrested a 28-year-old man from the Port Talbot area in connection with offensive comments made on the social networking site Twitter".
"The man was interviewed at Neath police station and has been released on police bail pending further inquiries," police added.
In a separate incident earlier this week, a 17-year-old was arrested and given a harassment warning over a malicious tweet relating to Daley's late father.
Daley and his diving partner Pete Waterfield came fourth in the 10m synchronised dive on Monday.
