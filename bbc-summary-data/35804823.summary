Last week, human remains were found close to Cribbs Causeway in Bristol which officers "strongly believe" are those of the missing pensioner.
A post-mortem over the weekend was inconclusive and further DNA testing is now being carried out.
However, Avon and Somerset Police said it was "satisfied that there's nothing to suggest [the death] was suspicious."
The 73-year-old went missing last July, sparking a high-profile campaign to find him.
Decomposed remains were found in undergrowth close to The Mall shopping Centre in Patchway by a member of the public, last Thursday.
Avon and Somerset Police said it had now completed an examination of the area and "strongly believe it is Derek" because of personal items found nearby.
DJ Derek's great-niece Jennifer Griffiths, said the discovery near the shopping centre had been "hurtful".
"I feel like the last eight months - all this searching and looking for him came to nothing because we were looking in the wrong area," she said.
"I feel guilty at the fact that I should have gone with my intuition and started looking at Cribbs Causeway."
DJ Derek, a former accountant, was known to thousands of music fans and played hundreds of sets at local clubs and pubs, as well as at the Glastonbury festival.
He was a resident of St Pauls in Bristol since 1978 and also appeared at gigs across the UK including the Big Chill, worked with Massive Attack and appeared in a Dizzee Rascal video.
