Stranraer marina jobs could cost £200,000 each

The business case for a key project to help "rejuvenate" Stranraer has estimated the jobs it creates could come at a cost of about £200,000 each.

It is thought the marina scheme could bring about 30 new posts to the town - but with a price of £6m.
The report said it was important to consider the "wider social and economic benefits" the project could bring.
Councillors are set to consider a number of options for taking forward the project later this week.
The Stranraer marina plan is seen as a vital element in helping the town to recover from the loss of ferry services.
The business case states: "We understand that a marina is more than a boat park - it is a mechanism for developing the tourism, socio-cultural, arts and economic fabric of an area.
"This project can offer a rejuvenation of Stranraer's economy and infrastructure.
"By creating an attractive waterfront development, it encourages visitors (both boat nights and other tourists) as well as encouraging investment in the area by the private sector."
However, it accepts that the cost of the scheme per job created is much higher than the "generally accepted ceiling" of about £25,000.
Four options for the project have emerged but one has been earmarked as the preferred plan.
It is thought to be the "most complementary to adjacent development" and able to "maximise the use of associated development on the reclaimed land".
Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was also felt that it would generate the most "commercially viable marina development" and "have the greatest impact on the wider regeneration of the town".
The proposal includes:
The business case backs that option but accepts that a private operator would be unlikely to be found.
"Due to the low projected returns it seems unlikely, at this stage, that an independent marina developer would find the project appealing and therefore it is likely that the council will need to run the expanded marina or grant a management contract/ operational lease," it states.
Councillor Marion McCutcheon, who chairs the Wigtown area committee, said building the local economy was the "number one priority" for the council.
"Developing the Stranraer waterfront is key to the regeneration of the town," she said.
"Expanding the marina is a vital component.
"There are sound business reasons for this, including bringing more visitors to Stranraer, generating business, and creating employment."
