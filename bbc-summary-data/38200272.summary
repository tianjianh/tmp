The event in Calne, Wiltshire was judged by an adjudicator after 1,254 people gathered on The Green dressed as shepherds, angels and wise men.
They beat the previous record set in Utah, America of 1,039.
Organiser Rachel Rounds thanked people for getting involved and said: "It just really goes to show what a community can do together."
She organised the attempt for Calne Town Council and the Bible Society and added she was "so proud of the whole town".
Guinness adjudicator Jack Brockbank described it as "a fantastic result".
