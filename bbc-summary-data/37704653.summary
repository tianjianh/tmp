[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Urgent action is needed following the closure of three care homes in Conwy County, the chair of Care Forum Wales has said.

The Plas Parciau care home in Old Colwyn, the Plas Isaf Residential Home in Rhos on Sea, and Colwyn Bay's Furze Mount have all closed.
Mario Kreft said: "We are saddened but unfortunately not surprised by the closures."
The Welsh Government said they were committed to social care.
Mr Kreft said: "At a time of escalating need, care homes and domiciliary care companies are afflicted by chronic underfunding.
"We are at a tipping point and unless urgent action is taken we are facing the prospect of even more care and nursing home closures which will result in extra pressure on the NHS, which is already creaking under the strain."
The Plas Parciau building and surrounding land is owned by North Wales Housing.
Owen Ingram, their interim chief executive, said: "Closing the home is not a decision we made lightly, but we have had to address that it is not a financially viable business."
At the time of closing there were 13 residents at Plas Parciau. Mr Ingram added: "North Wales Housing have worked closely with sociaservices, residents and their families to find a suitable, regulated home that best meets their care needs."
In their manifesto for the assembly elections, the Welsh Government pledged to "make social care a sector of national strategic importance".
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "We are working closely with our partners in north Wales to understand the challenges faced and to work to ensure the best outcomes for those receiving care.
"We are providing an additional Â£25 million for local authorities specifically for social services, as well as investing Â£60 million to support service transformation through the Intermediate Care Fund."
In England, the number of care homes has fallen over the past six years by nearly 1,500 to 16,600.
Recent evidence gathered by the Care Quality Commission shows the regulator is worried over the "pace" of care home closures.
