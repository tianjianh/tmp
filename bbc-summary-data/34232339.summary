Essex Police said the raid happened at the Santander branch inside the Intu Lakeside centre in Thurrock.
The break-in was at some point between 01:35 and 03:50 BST, officers said.
The branch has been closed while investigations are carried out. Police have appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
A police spokesman said one of the ATMs was broken in to, but the money was "removed from elsewhere in the premises".
