The match at Hampden Park on 21 May was disrupted when fans invaded the pitch after Hibernian's 3-2 win over Rangers.
Hibernian supporters invaded the pitch and some Rangers fans also made it past stewards before mounted police officers restored order.
Police have so far made 76 arrests as part of the ongoing investigation.
The Scottish Football Association (SFA) announced on Wednesday that neither club would face punishment for the crowd trouble, in line with the governing body's disciplinary rules.
Earlier, an independent report commissioned by the SFA said the Scottish government should consider making it a criminal offence to run onto a football pitch.
Anyone with information about the identities of the suspects should contact Govan Police Office or use the dedicated mailbox address.
Alternatively they can contact Crimestoppers where information can be given anonymously.
