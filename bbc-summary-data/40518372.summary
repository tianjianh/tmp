[SN]TITLE[SN]
Five takeouts from this Parliament so far

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Some take-outs from this Parliament:

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
1. Conservative Brexiteers maintain their public show of confidence that their vision will be fulfilled, but some are increasingly nervous.
The removal of Brexit Minister David Jones in the post-election reshuffle has crystallised fears that the government might offer a watered down version of Brexit, putting Britain in a kind of granny annexe to the EU, complete with a ground rent payable to the EU and a connecting door through which immigration could continue and the European Court of Justice could continue to regulate.
Alternatively, some fear a transitional deal that becomes such a long goodbye that the UK never, in the end, makes its final farewell to the EU.
Maastricht veteran Bernard Jenkin blogged recently that any retreat would destroy Conservative Party unity: "The message could not be clearer: if the Conservatives turn back on the referendum result in any substantial way, the huge divisions that beset the party from Thatcher to Cameron will re-open, and we will become again unelectable."
2. The snap election left Jeremy Corbyn with a parliamentary party dominated by his critics.
They now expect a purge, with some of the most prominent Corbyn-sceptics likely to face attempts at deselection. Meanwhile a number of MPs who quit the Labour frontbench in the last Parliament, in protest against Mr Corbyn, are returning to the colours.
3. Lindsay Hoyle looks increasingly like the next Speaker of the Commons - but maybe not for quite a while.
He dominated this week's election for the three deputy Speaker posts, leaving the two other contenders, Rosie Winterton and Roberta Blackman-Wood, trailing far behind him.
But Speaker Bercow, meanwhile, sits more safely in the chair of the Commons than at any time during his speakershipâ€¦..and he has been confident enough to select some testing backbench amendments to the Queen's Speech. The Speaker has never been more powerful - because it is hard to imagine a majority against him being mustered by his critics, and he could be called upon to make some crucial rulings in a House of Commons balanced on a knife-edge between government and opposition.
4. The scheme to empty out the Victorian buildings of the Palace of Westminster - Restoration and Renewal as it's known in Commons jargon - looks dead in the water.
Spending billions revamping Parliament is not a good look, in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster, and even before that, and before the election returned a hung Parliament, ministers seemed nervous of the necessary Commons vote on the issue.
But the risks of inaction remain; those iconic Victorian buildings are in a terrible state, but muddle through, and make-do and mend seem the most probable option - with the parliamentary authorities crossing their fingers and hoping fire or power cuts don't force them into a sudden and ramshackle exodus.
5. Summertime and the legislating is easyâ€¦
Any Commons drama before the summer looks likely to be supplied by events, dear boy, statements and urgent questions, rather than big controversial bills.
The legislation in both Houses, so far, is uncontroversial, technical fare, rather than the anticipated diet of big-ticket Brexit bills.
And without select committees to provide occupational therapy, MPs can look forward to a torpid July, before their holidays begin.
Hostilities will resume in September.
