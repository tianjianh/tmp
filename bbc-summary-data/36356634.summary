A 45-year-old man has died after being attacked by his pet dog at his home, police in Cumbria have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was pronounced dead at the scene of the attack at the house in Robert Owen Avenue, Cleator Moor, at about 14:00 BST on Sunday.
The animal, believed to be a Staffordshire pitbull crossbreed, was destroyed.
Three other dogs were seized from the property and will be examined to determine if they are a banned breed.
The victim has not yet been identified.
Insp Gary Hunter said the man's two teenage daughters are thought to have pulled the dog away from their father before calling police.
When officers arrived they found the animal shut in a bedroom in a distressed state.
Efforts to subdue the animal using deterrent sprays failed, and officers were forced to use a Taser gun.
Insp Hunter said: "In 20 years I've never seen anything like that. The dog had been angry for a good three hours or so.
"There was a lot of blood everywhere and the dog was still in a room quite close to the landing.
"The door wasn't that secure and behind the door the dog was barking very loudly and trying to get out."
