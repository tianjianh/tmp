Two David McMillan goals and an injury-time Robbie Benson strike earned the Irish champions a 3-0 home-leg victory at Tallaght Stadium.
That ensured a 3-1 aggregate success over their Belarusian counterparts.
It also guaranteed Stephen Kenny's Dundalk at least a place in the Europa League group stages.
Dundalk were already guaranteed £1m after progressing to the Champions League third qualifying round but that sum has now increased to around £5.9m.
The draw for the final Champions League qualifying round will take place in Monaco on Friday, and Dundalk could meet Celtic after the Scottish champions progressed against Astana of Kazakhstan.
Other potential opponents are Viktoria Plzen, Apoel Nicosia, Legia Warsaw and Red Bull Salzburg.
Dundalk's victory on Tuesday avenged last year's 2-1 aggregate defeat by the Belarusians in the Champions League second qualifying round.
The League of Ireland champions secured their remarkable win despite having to move their home leg from Oriel Park to Tallaght Stadium in Dublin because of Uefa ground capacity rules.
Those rules state that Champions League matches from the third qualifying round onwards must take place at venues with a minimum of 4,500 seats. Oriel Park has only 3,000 seats in its 4,500 capacity. Around 5,000 supporters were at Tuesday's match.
BATE, regular qualifiers for the Champions League group stages, were left to rue missed first-half chances as Yuri Kendysh headed over and Aleksei Rios shot wide when well placed in the 16th minute.
Against the run of play, Dundalk took the lead on the stroke of half-time as Daryl Horgan's cross picked out McMillan, who guided a header past Sergei Veremko.
Dundalk had an escape in the 56th minute as Rios shot wide, but three minutes later the Irish side were ahead in the tie as McMillan nodded a Dane Massey cross into the net.
After repelling some BATE pressure, Dundalk made the tie safe in the first minute of injury-time as substitute Benson broke clear and slotted past Veremko.
