Ross County 1-2 Motherwell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Motherwell moved into the Premiership's top six as they beat Ross County to end a run of three games without a win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jay McEveley's mistake allowed Motherwell striker Scott McDonald to run through on goal unopposed and knock the ball past goalkeeper Scott Fox.
However, McEveley made amends when he headed in Martin Woods' corner.
Louis Moult headed Motherwell back in front from Chris Cadden's corner and, despite chances from Alex Schalk and Liam Boyce, the visitors held on.

Motherwell came into this off the back of two defeats by Rangers, with uncertainty surrounding the future of McDonald who has been the subject of interest from Australia.
The script was written and he delivered. Any doubt about his focus was quickly extinguished, mainly thanks to McEveley's lack of it.
He let a simple ball slide under his boot straight into McDonald's path and he did what he does in such situations with a composed finish.
He nearly added a second from close range before Moult flicked the ball off a post from an offside position.
Moult delivered though with a firm header after being allowed too much space from a corner.
There was a lot to like about Motherwell. They were comfortable on the ball and caused problems for the County back-line by pressing early.
They had to defend more as the match wore on but they stood firm, which will delight Mark McGhee.
Stephen Pearson will sign on to bolster the midfield and if McDonald is retained with interest in Celtic's Nadir Ciftci very much alive at time of writing, this could prove to be a pivotal evening for the Fir Park side after a well-earned win.
Manager Jim McIntyre talked before the match about the need for his players to cut out unnecessary errors and maintain concentration.
McEveley must take responsibility for allowing the ball to skid under his foot with little danger, straight to McDonald who netted.
You could see in McEveley's reaction to his equaliser how much it meant; he knew he had made a disastrous error beforehand.
Their goal was typical of County at set-pieces. It was straight off the training ground with McEveley's looping header evading Craig Samson, although the goalkeeper felt he was impeded by Schalk.
County create chances and score goals, but they are conceding too many too cheaply, as was also the case for Motherwell's second.
Schalk came close on three occasions while Boyce might have done better from a few yards out.
Michael Gardyne should definitely have done better from an angle but screwed well wide.
Consecutive defeats here and against Kilmarnock have been damaging for their top-six hopes with Rangers at Ibrox next.

Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "Again, even in games we've won, we've had calamitous moments that have led to us gifting teams goals and we've got another two tonight.
"We never played well at all tonight but created opportunities - but until we stop gifting teams it's tough to win games.
"There's no doubt Motherwell were playing the better stuff. We had a poor 45 minutes at Kilmarnock and it carried on tonight.
"I think if it continues to happen, [players] have to be left out. It comes from a lack of concentration. It's not good enough at this level.
"Nobody's questioning the boys' attitude or effort but I'm certainly questioning that mentality."
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: "I thought it was tidy. I was disappointed to lose a goal from a corner. That was a set-back but we dug in and I feel comfortable that we deserved to win.
"That's why we've been desperate to keep [Scott McDonald]. He leads the line so well. I thought the two up front were brilliant.
"I hope McDonald stays you just never know right up to the last minute but we do want him to stay."
