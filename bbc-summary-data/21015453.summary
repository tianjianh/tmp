Police say a row broke out just after 23:00 GMT inside the pub and there was a further altercation outside.
Mr Prosser, was taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, but died. The ages of the arrested men range from 24 to 48.
A forensic team from South Wales Police were taking evidence inside and outside the pub, which remained closed on Monday.
A post-mortem examination is ongoing.
Det Supt Paul Hurley said: "I am particularly keen to speak to anyone who was in St Mary Street at the time that may have witnessed an altercation involving a number of people outside the pub."
He added: "Our thoughts are with Mr Prosser's family at this very difficult time.
"I would urge anyone who was in the area and witnessed what happened, either inside or outside O'Neill's, to please contact us."
Police are appealing for witnesses to call 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
A spokesman for O'Neill's in St Mary Street said: "A serious incident took place late yesterday evening.
"The police are currently investigating and we are co-operating fully."
A statement on the Beddau RFC website said: "Lyn was a huge character in the village and was well known by many from not just our community but from far and wide.
"He was a larger than life character and a friend to so many.
"He starred in the back row for both the Beddau and Llantrisant clubs and will be so sorely missed by all.
"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this sad time."
