Vince, 24, who is also the county's one-day captain, was appointed on an interim basis after Jimmy Adams decided to step down to focus on his batting.
Hampshire held on for a draw against Durham in Vince's first County Championship match in charge.
"There's a nice period between now and the end of the season to get a taste for it," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's game by game for now, but I think the likelihood is it will probably be until the end of the season.
"I can see if it's something I would want to take on in the future. I was more than happy to give it a crack when Jimmy decided to step down."
Hampshire currently sit 18 points adrift at the foot of the Division One table and Vince was dismissed for 19 and 0 against Durham.
But his batting has flourished while captain in the T20 Blast, including carrying his bat three times.
"We've had too many individuals under performing," he added.
"We've got to up it as individuals and Jimmy obviously decided by not captaining, he could bring his game forward.
"Personally, I think captaincy takes a bit of my mindset of my batting, which has been a real help in Twenty20."
