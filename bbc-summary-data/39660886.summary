Jon Stead: Striker '50/50' on his Notts County future with USA offer on the table

Notts County striker Jon Stead says it is "50/50" if he will stay at the club after this season or move to the USA.

Stead, 34, joined the Magpies from Bradford in 2015 but nearly left the League Two club for the US in January.
He stayed at Notts County following Alan Hardy's takeover and Kevin Nolan's appointment as manager, but his future is again in doubt with his contract set to expire at the end of the season.
"I've got to go with where my heart tells me," he said.
Stead has dismissed offers from other English clubs and will decide at the end of the season between a potential extension at Meadow Lane and moving to America.
"If you'd asked me in January I knew exactly where I wanted to go, but since the new owner and the gaffer have come in I've absolutely loved working here," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"I'm still not sure. I have days when I wake up and I think I want to be on a plane and I have days when I want to be back here next season.
"I'm torn 50/50. We'll have discussions and I'll have to sit down again with my family. It'll probably wait until the end of the season."
