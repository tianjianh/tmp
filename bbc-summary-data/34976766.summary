A public vote has seen Peebles emerge as the preferred location for a whisky distillery project in the Borders.

R&B Distillers launched its "big question" survey earlier this year.
Peebles has been announced as the winner after stacking up more votes than all the other potential sites added together.
The company said that "exactly how and when" its plans would unfold was now being developed.
The project is one of a number which hope to open the first distillery in the Borders in nearly 180 years.
Two weeks ago the Three Stills Company announced it had secured funding of Â£10m to support its plans to establish a distillery in Hawick.
Last year, Mossburn Distillers also unveiled plans for a Â£40m project south of Jedburgh.
R&B found overwhelming public backing for Peebles over the other sites it was considering.
They were the Tweed Valley, Kelso, Eyemouth, Selkirk, Coldstream, Melrose and Galashiels.
