French club Clermont replace Helena Costa with Corinne Diacre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clermont Foot have appointed a second female coach - former France captain Corinne Diacre - as a replacement for Helena Costa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Costa had become the first woman to manage a men's professional football team in the top two tiers of any European league when she was appointed last month.
But the 36-year-old quit on Monday, claiming players had been hired without her authority.
Diacre, 39, has signed a two-year deal.
"Corinne Diacre has accepted the position of coach of Clermont Foot for the next two seasons and will take up the post early next week," read a club statement
Clermont play in the French second division.
Diacre has been assistant coach to the national team for the last seven years, as well as managing her former club Soyaux since 2010.
She made 121 appearances for France between 1993 and 2005.
In 1999, Carolina Morace was appointed coach of Serie C1 club Viterbese in Italy but quit after two matches, blaming media pressure.
