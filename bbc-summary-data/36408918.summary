The world number two saved three set points in a 16-minute first-set tie-break and was leading 7-6 (11-9) 2-1 when play was stopped because of rain.
Murray, 29, outclassed 15th seed Isner after the break to seal a 7-6 (11-9) 6-4 6-3 win in two hours and 40 minutes.
The Scot faces either Japanese fifth seed Kei Nishikori or France's ninth seed Richard Gasquet in the last eight.
Murray, who needed five sets to win his first two matches in France, followed up his emphatic third-round win over Ivo Karlovic with another solid display against a big-serving opponent.
The Briton also held his own serve throughout - saving five break points, including three with aces - and finished the match with another ace to maintain his 100% record against Isner.
A key moment came in the first set tie-break when Murray saved a set point on Isner's serve by firing a backhand down the line past the advancing American.
Murray saved two more before taking the first set and never looked back as he secured his place in the last eight.
With more rain expected he will be pleased to have finished the match on Sunday to ensure he has a day off on Monday.
"It was a very important tie-break to win. I got lucky on his first set point when I guessed right on a short forehand," said Murray, who has reached the quarter-finals at 19 of the last 20 Grand Slam events he has contested.
