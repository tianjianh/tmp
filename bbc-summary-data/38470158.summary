Carl Campbell, 33, was shot on High Street in West Bromwich on Tuesday.
Mohammed Humza, 19, and Vikesh Chauhan, 24, are also charged with attempted murder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and possession of a prohibited object.
They appeared at Wolverhampton Crown Court earlier and are due to appear again on 26 January.
Relatives have described Mr Campbell as a "much loved son, devoted father and beloved brother".
The family addressed reports he was jailed in 2009 for causing the death by dangerous driving of Clarence Elwin in Tipton.
His family said: "Carl was a young man at the time who had a full driving licence, tax and insurance. He just panicked and left the scene.
"He was not a killer, it was an accident and he panicked so please don't judge him on that incident alone."
