London 2012: Ex-soldier's Olympic torch relay joy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An injured soldier from Doncaster who feared the Olympic torch route had changed to an "undulating" area can now carry the flame on a level road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson has prosthetic limbs after losing his legs in an explosion in Afghanistan in 2006.
He was due to carry the torch on 26 June on a flat route in Bennetthorpe but then heard it had changed, putting his participation in doubt.
The London 2012 organising committee, Locog, has now reversed its decision.
Lance Bombardier Parkinson was originally due to walk past the cenotaph in Bennetthorpe but was then allocated a stretch of the A630 Balby Road.
His mother, Diane Dernie, said he would be unable to walk on the route using artificial legs without the aid of crutches.
That decision has now been altered.
Mr Parkinson's family said they "were delighted at the change of heart at Locog".
Lance Bombardier Parkinson, who served with the 7 Para Royal Horse Artillery, also suffered brain damage and a broken back when his Land Rover was ripped apart by an anti-tank mine.
Ms Dernie said: "For Ben it's not just a matter of turning up and running. He's worked for this ever since he was nominated."
Ms Dernie said Locog had told her a wheelchair could be used to carry the Olympic torch but the suggestion was dismissed by Lance Bombardier Parkinson.
