Germany's Red Baron relative meets Welsh WW1 victim's family

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a World War One airman who was one of the first to die in battle with Germany's Red Baron pilot has met his relatives 100 years on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Red Baron - Manfred von Richthofen - went on to have 80 aerial combat victories credited to him before he was killed in 1918.
Capt Tom Rees, from Brecon, had joined the Welsh Fusiliers and put his name forward for the Royal Flying Corps.
He died aged 21 on 17 September 1916 with pilot Lionel Morris from Croydon.
Capt Rees' great-niece Meriel Jones met the Red Baron's great-nephew Baron Donat von Richthofen and relatives of Lt Morris at a ceremony to mark the 100th anniversary of the air battle.
Ms Jones told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales that her great uncle , who went to school in Brecon County School and Aberystwyth University college, joined up near the start of the war and volunteered to join the Royal Flying Corps.
She said: "This day 100 years ago, he was the observer in a plane with a pilot, Lionel Morris. They were sent to escort some bombers to go to bomb a station behind the German lines and they were intercepted by some squadrons of German fighters.
"Six of the British planes were shot down, including the one with my great-uncle in it. He, of course, was trying to stop the Red Baron from shooting them down."
Baron von Richthoven said his great-uncle, although famous in Germany, was better known in English-speaking countries.
Following the deaths of Capt Rees and Lt Morris, the Red Baron started a tradition of commissioning a silver goblet after every successful battle to toast his fallen opponent.
By the time of his death in April 1918, he was known, feared but respected on both sides of the battle lines.
