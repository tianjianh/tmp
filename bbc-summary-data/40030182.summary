The 25-year-old is available to play in both the County Championship and T20 Blast, which starts in July.
Milne has played 34 one-day internationals and 18 Twenty20 games for the Black Caps and is a handy lower-order batsman.
"I'm delighted to be joining Kent and working with such a talented squad pushing for promotion," said Milne.
The final of the Champions Trophy is on 18 June, with Kent starting their Championship match against Worcestershire the following day.
"Adam is capable of bowling in excess of 90mph and will add even more penetration to our attack in red-ball and white-ball cricket," added Kent chairman of cricket Graham Johnson.
"It's a long season so we will need to rotate the bowlers and we hope Adam's arrival will add impetus with the ball."
