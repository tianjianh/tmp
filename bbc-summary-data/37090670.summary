[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Surrey bowlers dominate Warwickshire to earn victory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Surrey's bowlers dominated the final day as the visitors cruised to victory over Warwickshire at Edgbaston.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Resuming on 2-1 in pursuit of 396 to win, the hosts were reduced to 72-4 by lunch and then lost Laurie Evans shortly after the interval.
Tim Ambrose (27 not out) batted for nearly three hours, while Ian Bell top-scored for the Bears with 32.
But the hosts lost wickets at regular intervals, as they were all out for 169, 227 runs short of their target.
Gareth Batty, Mark Footitt and Stuart Meaker accounted for two dismissals each, while Zafar Ansari, Tom Curran and Sam Curran also took a wicket.
The result rounded off a miserable day for Warwickshire, who have lost pace bowler Boyd Rankin for the rest of the season with a broken leg.
Surrey climb to second in the table with three games left to play this season, 30 points behind leaders Middlesex, who have four games remaining.
Warwickshire remain fifth, 39 points off the top of the table but well clear of the relegation zone.
