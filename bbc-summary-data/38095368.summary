[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Durham teaching assistants announce further strikes in pay row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Teaching assistants striking over a pay dispute have announced four further days of industrial action.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Support staff in County Durham say a council plan to pay them only during term time would result in a salary cut of up to 23%.
Further action will be taken on 1 December, followed by 6-8 December.
Durham County Council has said it could face equal pay claims from other employees if it does not make changes and cannot afford to raise wages.
It has proposed ending the contracts of support staff and re-engaging them on amended terms.
Unison, which represents many of the teaching assistants, has described the planned cut to salaries as "heartless and cruel".
About 100 schools had to close or cut lessons during a two-day stoppage earlier this month.
The latest 48-hour strike affected 87 schools - 70% have been partially closed with 19 shut both days, the council said.
