Zoe Clark, 24, of Carronbridge, Thornhill, was driving a Vauxhall Corsa that was involved in the collision on the A76, five miles south of Mennock.
One of the ambulance crew members received a head injury and was airlifted to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.
The driver of the ambulance and two casualties suffered minor injuries.
The ambulance was leaving the scene of an earlier accident when it was involved in the second incident at about 08:40.
It blocked the main road between Dumfries and Kilmarnock for about seven hours.
A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said the accident happened while the ambulance was transferring two patients to hospital in Dumfries.
He added: "Our deepest sympathies go out to the family of the driver of the car, who tragically died.
"One member of the ambulance crew has been airlifted to hospital with potentially serious injuries.
"The other crew member and the patients were also taken to hospital by ambulance but are not seriously injured."
A spokesman for Police Scotland said a woman in the rear of the ambulance had been involved in a road accident further north on the A76.
She was being transported to hospital in Dumfries, accompanied by her husband, when the second crash happened.
Sgt Doug Millar said: "There was a previous road traffic collision further north and the ambulance which had dealt with that was returning to Dumfries with two people in the rear.
"There has been a northbound motor car and, for reasons we do not yet know, they have collided."
He said it was one of a spate of crashes across the region.
"Conditions across Dumfries and Galloway have been very difficult this morning," he said.
"I have just come from the A74 motorway and I was dealing with three collisions over there.
"There have been numerous collisions in Dumfries and Galloway this morning."
Meanwhile, all three emergency services were in attendance at a crash in central Galashiels.
Two cars and a bus were involved in the accident at the junction of Tweed Road and Nether Road just before 09:30.
Fire crews from Galashiels and Selkirk were cutting one of the drivers free from the wreckage.
