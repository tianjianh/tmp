A flagship arts centre in Denbighshire still has a good future despite the closure of its cafe and two artists returning their shop keys, according to a senior councillor.

Ruthin Craft Centre's coffee shop shut before Christmas and only one out of six workshops are currently occupied.
The cafe's former tenants blamed a fall in visitors for its closure.
But councillor Huw Jones said four applicants were interested in running the cafe and four of the empty units
He also said 80,000 people visited the centre in 2015 with 5,500 in December - down a "few hundred" on usual figures which he blamed on the weather.
The craft centre, which is funded by the council and Arts Council of Wales, was revamped in 2008 in a scheme costing Â£4.3m.
Mr Jones, Denbighshire council's lead member for rural development, said the departure of the artists and cafe tenants within a short space of time was a "perfect storm".
He said he expected four applications soon for vacant workshop spaces while the cafe could reopen before Easter as tendering application forms were being sent to several applicants this week.
"If this would have happened over a 12 month period, as things do, it would not have been a problem but it happened at the same time," he said.
"Officers at Denbighshire County Council are working tirelessly to get this sorted. In the next few months we will be back up and running and things will be fine.
"Fresh people with fresh ideas is not a bad thing, especially with culture and crafts," he said.
Sole tenant, textile artist Cefyn Burgess, said: "It's sad that it got to the stage that two of the businesses have gone, and finally the cafÃ© gave up as well.
"It's been good to be here, but one must consider is this a good place to be to develop further because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen to the other units.
"This is something I'm going to have to consider in the next few months."
