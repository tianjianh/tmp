More than 200 schools were closed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on Wednesday and police advised motorists to take care when travelling on untreated roads.

BBC weather presenter John Hammond said: "Wet and windy weather is going to sweep across the whole of the country on Wednesday evening and overnight."

Scotland and Northern Ireland could also see some more snow falling as well as rain, our forecaster said.
The harsh weather is set to continue on Thursday and into the weekend.
Met Office spokesman Jonathan Hunter said: "Tomorrow we may see wintry showers across the UK with sleet, snow and rain.
"There may be strong winds tomorrow but easing through the day. On Friday and towards the weekend it will be really cold and we may see some snow showers in the north and at high levels."
Road operator Bear Scotland vowed its teams would be working around the clock to keep routes clear.
Police Scotland advised against travelling unless completely necessary.
Ch Insp Louise Blakelock said: "If you do decide to travel, ensure your vehicle is well-prepared before setting off, make sure your windscreens are completely free of snow and ice, and your lights are working and clean."
Scotrail said services would be suspended on a number of West Coast routes from 12:00 GMT on Wednesday until 18:00 GMT on Thursday due to the stormy conditions being forecast.
