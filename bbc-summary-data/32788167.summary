London Fire Brigade (LFB) was called to the warehouse in Lombard Wall, Charlton, at about 16:10 BST.
About 10% of the 100m-long (328ft) building was ablaze, and six lorries were damaged.
Four people were assessed for the effects of smoke of inhalation at the scene and the fire was under control by 18:30 BST, the brigade said.
LFB said that at the height of the fire businesses and residents in the area were advised to keep their doors and windows closed.
Station manager Bruce Grain said: "During its early stages this was a very intense fire.
"Crews wearing breathing apparatus attacked it extremely quickly and thanks to their efforts the fire was prevented from spreading any further into the warehouse and causing even more damage."
LFB said an investigation had begun into the cause of the fire.
