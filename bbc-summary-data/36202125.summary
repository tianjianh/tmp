A Jamie Vardy lookalike was mobbed in his car outside Leicester City's ground when ecstatic Foxes fans mistook him for the star striker.

Ian Haughey, a car salesman from Derby, went to the King Power stadium to celebrate the Foxes' first Premier League title on Monday night.
But fans thought they recognised him and surrounded his car asking for pictures and autographs.
When he called police for help they queried if he was not Mr Vardy.
Mr Haughey, who was only recently told he bears a resemblance to the striker, was driving his work BMW and wearing a shirt and blazer.

He agreed to have his photograph taken with several fans but when he was approached for autographs he confessed that he was not the star they were looking for.
"It was funny, I joined in on a few photos but that gathered the attention. I thought I better escape," he said.
"I kind of got bombarded... everybody started crowding round, people climbing on the bonnet. I had to lock the doors and bring up the windows.
"I had mixed emotions. I was thinking 'I'm never going to experience this again. This is quite funny.' I was looking around and then when the car started shaking it was slightly scary."

Mr Haughey filmed the moment he was surrounded which has since been watched thousands of times on Facebook.
After about an hour trapped in his car with friends, police helped him make his escape.
He has no plans to become a professional lookalike - but has offered his help to the Leicester legend.
"If the real Jamie Vardy wants to have a night out and needs to be in two places at once, he can just message me," he joked.
Another Jamie Vardy doppelganger was "dragged" on to the team bus during Tuesday's celebrations and was pictured with the real Jamie Vardy.
