Nipsa: Electoral office industrial action 'will affect' EU referendum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Industrial action at the Northern Ireland Electoral Office will disrupt preparation for the EU referendum, the public service union Nipsa has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Strike action has been scheduled for Friday, 3 June and Tuesday, 7 June.
These dates are the deadlines for postal vote applications and voter registration.
Nipsa added that further strike action could be scheduled "up to and possibly including the day of the referendum".
The vote will be held on Thursday, 23 June.
Union members had voted to take industrial action over plans to close six regional electoral offices.
The offices facing closure are in Ballymena, Banbridge, Londonderry, Newtownabbey, Newtownards and Omagh.
The Electoral Office plans to centralise many of its services in Belfast.
The Electoral Commission has said it is focused on "ensuring that voters don't face disruption."
