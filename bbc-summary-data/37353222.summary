In pictures: How the Scottish indyref campaign unfolded

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If a week is a long time in politics, then two years is a lifetime, so here's a visual reminder of some of the key moments and some of the lighter ones which led up to the Scottish independence referendum of September 18, 2014.

The big question - YES or NO - Should Scotland be an independent country?
Before long, facts, figures, demographics and projections would become a battleground of claim and counterclaim.
As the campaigns began to build up, so did the leaflets, newsletters, flyers, badges and car stickers.
The indyref very quickly became a hotbed of social media activism - serious, not so, or a bit of both - like Lady Alba going a bit Gaga.
Scottish actor James McAvoy also brought some light relief to the campaign, issuing the Ice Bucket Challenge to some of the key players.
But there could be no doubt that the serious issues were being debated across the country - as Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond clashed in a series of debates.
And as the debates unfolded on screen - the reaction across social media mirrored the flashpoints of the arguments.
Meanwhile, official broadcasts drove home the campaign messages - some creating more of an impact than was maybe intended.
Out on the streets, there were grassroots events and soap box politicians - with Jim Murphy even taking an egg for his troubles.
The road leading to the indyref vote had of course been a long one, and BBC correspondent Allan Little wrote a long read to take a long look back.
As momentum grew so polls narrowed in the weeks running up the historic vote - a big moment coming with one showing independence in the lead.
And TV studios, town halls and streets across the Scotland became an arena for intense political debate.
At the same time as connecting and dividing Scots, the indyref energised and informed the country - drawing attention throughout Europe and across the globe.
At home, some Yes supporters even took their message to the steps of the BBC.
But among the TV showdowns, new online media ventures, tweets and Facebook groups it was an old fashioned newspaper front page which delivered the big pitch from the Better Together parties.
Efforts to win votes continued right up to the wire, with the outcome still considered to be on a knife-edge.
And then, late into 18 September 2014, the votes themselves began coming in.
The overall result was slightly wider than predicted with 55% No to 45% Yes.
For Alex Salmond it was the end of a long night, and would signal the end of his term as first minister, but he insisted his dream of independence would never die.
The vote had been No and the promise had been for a "once in a generation" decision. Alex Salmond had altered his phraseology to talk about once in a "political generation".
The Scottish referendum fallout, the general election and the Brexit aftermath have left Mr Salmond, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg in their wake.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has now said an indyref2 is highly likely - if two years can indeed be a lifetime in politics, how long exactly is a generation?
