North Yorkshire Drive Alive campaigner Janet Warin honoured

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road safety campaigner, whose son died in a car accident, has been appointed MBE in the New Year Honours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janet Warin, 67, from Pickering, North Yorkshire, is honoured for her work with a project which educates young people about driving safely.
She is also honoured for her community volunteer work.
Also honoured in North Yorkshire is Hillsborough campaigner Trevor Hicks, from Giggleswick near Settle, who becomes a CBE.
Mr Hicks' daughters Sarah, 19, and Victoria, 15, were among the 96 people who died at the FA Cup semi-final in April 1989.
Mrs Warin said working with the Drive Alive campaign, run by North Yorkshire County Council, helped honour her son Daniel's memory.
"We decided to make something good out of an awful tragedy. We are part of a whole day of events and we've spoken to around 32,000 students since we started all those years ago," she said.
"We just wanted to do something useful that would help us as well as others and we have never regretted it."
Mrs Warin, who also volunteers with Compassionate Friends which supports bereaved families, said she had found it hard not to tell people about the honour.
"I don't keep secrets very well at all and going to work every day and seeming normal was very difficult."
Others made MBE include Caroline Gardner.
Mrs Gardner, 74, from Leyburn, served as a magistrate for 17 years and founded the Wise Owl group, an organisation for retired magistrates.
Her charity work also includes establishing the Clervaux Trust, which supports young people with a range of difficulties.
