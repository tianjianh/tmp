[SN]TITLE[SN]
Antonio Reyes-Minana jailed for infecting men with HIV

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 25-year-old man who recklessly infected two other men with HIV has been jailed for seven years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antonio Reyes-Minana tested positive for HIV and went on to have unprotected sex with two partners without telling them he had the virus.
The Crown Prosecution Service said he had "explicitly lied" about his HIV status in the case of one victim.
Reyes-Minana, from Coppice Road, Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm.
The judge sentenced him to three and a half years in prison for each victim, with the sentences to run consecutively.
James Allen from the CPS said the sentence "reflects the seriousness of his offending".
"The consequences of Reyes-Minana's actions will remain with his victims for the rest of their lives," he said.
The two victims, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, gave evidence during the trial at Nottingham Crown Court.
Mr Allen said they gave "important evidence" to demonstrate how Reyes-Minana "must have known he was taking the risk of transmitting HIV".
Test results showed that the same virus was present in both victims and the defendant, and further results indicated the victims were likely to have been infected during the time period they were acquainted with him.
"Scientific evidence supported the prosecution case that it was Reyes-Minana had transmitted the virus to the victims," said Mr Allen.
Reyes-Minana was charged in October 2015.
Det Sgt Andrew Hall said: "It has taken a long time to bring the case to court and we are pleased with the result today."
