Burnett, 23, floored the 38-year-old in the opening round after a combination but Booth showed his experience to take the bout the distance.
The new champion had never gone further than six rounds in his 11 career bouts.
Burnett had Booth in trouble in the fifth and eighth rounds and he earned a 120-107 verdict from all three judges.
Booth had been aiming to become the first boxer in 80 years to become a three-weight British champion.
The Nottingham-born fighter previously held the British flyweight and super-bantamweight titles and also was Commonwealth champion at three weights.
Burnett is now trained by Adam Booth having recently moved to Eddie Hearn's Matchroom stable.
The Belfast man was previously managed by former world champion Ricky Hatton.
