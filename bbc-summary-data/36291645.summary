The discovery of the bomb on Thursday led to the evacuation of hundreds of homes and many road closures in the Lansdown area of the city.
A cordon around the site was lifted on Friday evening, more than 24 hours after residents were asked to leave their homes.
The bomb was destroyed in a controlled explosion late on Friday.
The Army took the device to Torr Quarry near Shepton Mallet where it was blown up.
Ch Supt Ian Smith said: "First and foremost, I would like to thank each and every resident who has been affected by this incident and numerous businesses in the local area.
"We have worked as quickly and diligently as possible to limit the disruption caused but, as you can expect with an incident of this nature, public safety has to be our primary concern."
