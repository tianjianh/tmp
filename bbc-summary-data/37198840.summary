[SN]TITLE[SN]
Appeal over Gwynedd council's refusal of 366 new Bangor homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A housing developer which was refused permission to build 366 homes in Bangor because of fears over the effect on the Welsh language is appealing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwynedd councillors also rejected the planning application by Morbaine because of concern about the impact on local traffic and schools.
The developer wants to build the houses at Pen y Ffridd in Penrhosgarnedd.
The planning inspectorate will consider the appeal before making a recommendation to the Welsh Government.
The application for the houses was the biggest considered by Gwynedd council and was refused using new planning rules designed to protect the Welsh language.
Residents had organised a petition against building at the 35.36 acre (14.3 ha) site raising concerns about overdevelopment and lack of infrastructure.
