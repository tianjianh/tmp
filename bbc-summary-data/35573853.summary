One teenager of 16 suffered serious stab injuries and is in a stable condition in hospital while two other boys aged 15 were treated for minor injuries.
They are believed to have been attacked on grassland near Westcote Close, Solihull, about 18:00 GMT on Saturday.
Det Sgt Sam Price said: "It is still unclear as to what actually happened and we have officers working around the clock to establish the circumstances."
She appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact West Midlands Police.
The three teenagers went to hospital with stab injuries shortly after the incident.
Detectives cordoned off an area of Hobs Meadow while specialist search and forensic officers examined the scene. Police are also carrying out house-to-house inquiries and examining CCTV footage.
