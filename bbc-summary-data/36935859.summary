The Rapids had Michael Azira sent off before Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo set up 38-year-old former England international Lampard for his first.
The ex-Chelsea player completed his hat-trick with two late goals after Tony Taylor and Steven Mendoza scored.
"I know it's a very short history but it's a great accolade for me," he said.
"I am really happy. I'm playing well, feeling good and obviously I can score goals."
Shkelzen Gashi scored in added time for the Rapids, whose 15-game unbeaten streak came to an abrupt end.
New York City were formed in 2013 in a partnership between baseball giants the New York Yankees and Premier League champions Manchester City.
Lampard endured an injury-hit start to the season and was booed by his own fans during a 7-0 defeat by New York Red Bulls in May.
But the former England midfielder, who signed for the franchise in 2015, has now scored eight times in his past seven games.
