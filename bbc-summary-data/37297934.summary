Dog owner Vickilee Galloway admits ordering dog attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A dog owner has admitted ordering her Staffordshire bull terrier to attack another woman in Peterhead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vickilee Galloway, 37, set her dog on Stacey Findlay after the two women started arguing in February last year.
Part of Ms Findlay's ear was torn off. A man was also attacked.
Galloway admitted assault by inciting her pet to attack Ms Findlay. Sentence at the High Court in Aberdeen was deferred, and she was remanded in custody.
She also pled guilty to being the owner of a dog that was so dangerously out of control that it attacked Brian Pennie.
Both victims had parts of their ears missing and needed hospital treatment.
Advocate depute Gillian Ross told the court that the incident happened after Galloway fell out with Ms Findlay while drinking in Mr Pennie's flat.
She said: "The accused started telling the complainer that her name was not in fact Stacey."
Ms Ross said Galloway then told her pet dog Jake to attack the other woman.
She told the court: "She used the words 'get her', 'Jake attack', or something similar.
"She was bitten on the arm which caused her to fall to the ground.
"The dog then started biting and attacking her left ear."
Galloway eventually managed to get the dog under control by grabbing his collar after it injured Mr Pennie and an ambulance was called.
Galloway sobbed in the dock as Lord Kinclaven remanded her in custody.
Sentence was deferred until 5 October at the High Court in Edinburgh for background reports.
