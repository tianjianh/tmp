[SN]TITLE[SN]
Leyton Orient 1-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jay Simpson's goal gave Leyton Orient victory over 10-man Accrington in a game marred by crowd trouble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Orient had not won a home league match since August 16th but Simpson's third goal of the campaign ended that wretched run of eight successive defeats on their own soil.
Stanley skipper Sean McConville was red-carded after denying Gavin Massey a goalscoring opportunity when he pulled back the O's midfielder just outside the penalty box.
Referee Darren Drysdale spent some time in consultation with one of his assistants before dismissing the visiting player and then also booked John O'Sullivan for dissent, while fans clashed behind the goal at the Accrington end.
Massey was the most impressive player for the Os on a rain-soaked pitch before setting up a number of decent chances for his colleagues that were wasted.
The visitors almost snatched the lead on 20 minutes when a shot by Jordan Clark on the greasy surface was spilled by keeper Alex Cisak, who recovered the ball to avert any damage.
Orient eventually broke down their resolute opponents in the 65th minute when full-back Myles Judd sent in a cross that Simpson forced over the line from six yards to give new manager Andy Edwards his first win in his second match in charge.
