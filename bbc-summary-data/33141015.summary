Newbie urban beekeepers 'lead to increase in swarms'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Beekeeping has become an increasingly popular hobby among people in towns and cities, but it also means swarms are being spotted more frequently.

In the most recent incident, a parked car in Greyabbey, County Down, was covered in bees.
While it might be alarming to see a swarm of bees, beekeeper Tom Canning says it is nothing to be worried about.
"Nobody wants to have to pay an extra parking fee because there's a swarm of bees on their car," he says.
"People are terrified of bees, but they don't need to be terrified of a swarm - I could take a swarm off a car within 15 minutes."
He says the message is "don't panic, leave them alone and call an experienced beekeeper who can deal with it".
"What you do is spray them with water, which makes them cluster in tighter and the bees will think it's raining - when they think it's raining, they're not going to fly so you've immobilised the outside of the swarm," he says.
"They'll hang there placidly for two hours."
Mr Canning, who has been a beekeeper for 50 years, says he is pleased that there is a new generation of hobbyists coming through "because they are the future protectors of bees".
However, he says that inexperienced beekeepers are often not learning what to do when their bees swarm, and it is important to take extra care of them in towns.
"Beginner hobbyists have to learn how to control swarms, which involves inspecting them once a week from the last week in April until the end of August, which is regularly the swarming season," he says.
"You could be a beginner beekeeper with a day job; it only takes bees 10 minutes to swarm and in that time, you're sitting at a desk miles away and don't know what's happening."
Mr Canning says swarms may be spotted in urban areas more frequently simply because there are more people there to see them.
While he says bees are not a threat, Mr Canning will not completely rule out the possibility of getting stung.
"There's a theory that bees can't sting you when they're swarming as they've gorged themselves with honey which prevents them from using their sting mechanism.
"This is 90% true, but you'll still get the 10% that will sting you!"
