Their 21-18 21-14 victory over Barbara Seixas and Agatha Bednarczuk dashed the crowd's hopes of a fourth home gold.
Earlier on, fellow Brazilians Talita Rocha and Larissa Franca were beaten in the bronze medal match by Kerri Walsh Jennings and April Ross of the USA.
Brazil has won 12 medals in the event since its inception at Atlanta 1996.
They could yet claim gold on home soil, with world champions Bruno Schmidt and Alison Cerutti playing Italy's Daniele Lupo and Paolo Nicolai in the men's final on Thursday (03:59 BST on Friday).
The women's medal matches started badly for the hosts with Walsh Jennings and Ross coming from behind to win 17-21 21-17 15-9.
And on a packed Copacabana beach, Ludwig and Walkenhorst dealt with blustery conditions and partisan atmosphere to earn Germany's 12th gold of the Games.
