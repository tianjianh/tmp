Hampshire Constabulary branded the air rifle attacks in Hartley Wintney "disgusting".
Another duck was shot in the head with an air rifle but was taken by a villager to a vet, and is expected to make a full recovery.
The shootings happened between Monday evening and Tuesday afternoon, police said.
PC Geoff Hill said: "The duck pond is at the heart of the village and has provided amusement for generations of families.
"It is disgusting that someone should curtail this by killing innocent and defenceless wildlife."
