The head of the consular department at Russia's embassy in Greece has been found dead in his flat in Athens, police say.

Initial signs suggested Andrey Malanin, 55, died of natural causes, but police said they were investigating the death.
Greek media said Mr Malanin had failed to report for work on Monday and did not answer his phone. He lived alone on a heavily guarded street.
Russian officials confirmed the consul's death.
The Proto Tema website said colleagues accompanied by police went round to the apartment to check on Mr Malanin but found the door locked from the inside.
He was found lying on his bedroom floor. Police said the body had no visible injuries and there had been no obvious break-in.
Moscow's ambassador to neighbouring Turkey, Andrei Karlov, was assassinated in December, apparently in protest at Russian involvement in the bombardment of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
