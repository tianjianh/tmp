Seth Rollins: Triple H's human side deserves respect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's the moment WWE fans have been talking about all week - Triple H stepping down to comfort a crying boy in the crowd at Monday Night Raw.

"It comes as a surprise and maybe that's because you don't see that side of Triple H that often," Seth Rollins tells Newsbeat.
"But you've got to remember that this is a father."
As Rollins points out, it's rare that viewers ever get to see WWE stars break character.
"I guess stuff like that doesn't get caught on camera as much as it actually happens but it's awesome.
"It just shows the real human side of Triple H.
"He's obviously an incredible character in our universe, however there's this man who's a great father so it's cool that people get to see him in that light, even in a very candid sort of way like that."
Rollins calls Newsbeat from the US, where he is preparing for Royal Rumble and one of the biggest moments of his career - facing John Cena and Brock Lesnar.
"The position that I'm in now is something that I've worked for, for my entire life and I think it's well-deserved," he says.
"Things could not be going any better for me heading into the 2015 WrestleMania season.
"It's an extraordinary time to be Mr Money in the Bank."
And, despite the pressure, he's confident people are going to be impressed with his performance on Sunday.
"I think I always rise to the occasion, I always come up big and I always make sure to hit a homerun and I don't foresee the situation on Sunday at the Royal Rumble being any different," he says.
"This is a very high profile match, my first shot at the WWE world heavyweight championship, and there's not a chance that I'll let that slip through my fingers."
He agrees he's one of the "polarising" figures in WWE - the kind of character people love to hate.
"The fans really, really, really dislike me so if you want to consider that support then I suppose that's getting me exactly where I need to be," he says.
"You want people to react and you want people to care about what you're doing."
Some fans in the UK had been disappointed by the multiple delays in the launch of the WWE Network.
In October 2014, the company blamed delays to the launch of the UK branch of the service on ongoing "discussions with potential partners".
It promised an announcement of the new date by 1 November 2014, but this was again put on hold.
"I know it was very frustrating for a lot of our fans," says Rollins.
"I'm stoked that we've finally launched the thing and everyone's happy and gets to finally see Seth Rollins and WWE on the Network.
"It's really worth the wait."
