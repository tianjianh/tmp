Jay Whiston was 17 years old when he was murdered by Edward Redman in Colchester in 2012.
Jay's mother Caroline Shearer, of Clacton, became an active campaigner on the dangers of knife crime after her son's death.
She said she had decided to stand as an independent for the Clacton seat, which has been held by Douglas Carswell.

In her message on Facebook, Mrs Shearer said: "I've gone and done it.
"I will now be intending to stand for Independent MP for Clacton and Tendring.
"I'm not interested in what other parties have done. It is about what we can do.
"I've created a charity to help reduce crime in the community. That's been my life since my son died.
"I'm now prepared to hand that all over so I can help people."
She said she wanted to try and solve the various problems in the Tendring area of north east Essex.
Former major UKIP donor Mr Banks admitted earlier this week knowing "nothing" about Clacton despite announcing he would be standing for election there. He has not confirmed which party he will stand for.
Following his announcement, the incumbent Mr Carswell, an independent who previously represented UKIP and the Conservatives, said he would not be seeking re-election.
