Officers said they were keeping "an open mind" over the motive for the stabbing.
No arrests have been made but a police spokesman confirmed the force was looking for a suspect or suspects.
Mr Appleton was in Nightingale Park with friends when two youths pulled up on a moped, police said.
The pillion passenger on the moped attacked the victim, stabbing him a number of times with a large bladed item before making off on the vehicle into Nightingale Road, a spokesman said.
BBC London reporter Emilia Papadopoulos, who was at the scene, said the Mr Appleton was stabbed in Nightingale Park, but managed to stumble across the road to Caldy Walk where he collapsed.
She added: "This attack happened in broad daylight and right in the middle of the estate, and witnesses told me there were children playing here at the time."
The moped involved is described by police as having a clear front screen and displayed an L plate to the rear, while the pillion passenger was wearing dark clothing and a dark helmet.
Det Ch Insp Chris Jones said: "I am very keen to hear from everyone who was in the area of Caldy Walk.
"We are also keen to hear from anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious or who has information that could assist the investigation."
