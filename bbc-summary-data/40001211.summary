Ryan Christie: Ineligible midfielder will not be in stands for Aberdeen v Celtic cup final

Ryan Christie has a foot in both camps for the Scottish Cup final - but, with no place for him in either side, he will not make the trip to Hampden.

The 22-year-old helped Aberdeen reach the final during a loan spell, but as a Celtic player, he cannot feature when the sides meet in Saturday's showpiece.
"I'm not planning on going. I'll be sitting on my couch watching it at home," Christie told BBC Scotland.
"I don't know what to say about it as it's a strange position to be in."
Attacking midfielder Christie joined the Dons on loan in January and has enjoyed a fruitful spell at Pittodrie, netting seven goals, with five of those coming in the last five matches.
Due to the terms of his loan deal, however, he cannot turn out for Aberdeen against Celtic.
And, while Christie will not join the thousands of supporters in the Hampden stands, he expects them and the viewers at home to be treated to a spectacular ending to the Scottish season.
"I wish both clubs all the best and I'm really looking forward to it," he said. "I think it will be a great cup final and a great way to round off the season."

Christie signed for Celtic from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in a deal worth around Â£500,000 in September 2015 but immediately rejoined the Highlanders on loan.
He started this season in Glasgow, scoring in Celtic's 4-2 victory over St Johnstone in their first match of the league campaign, before joining Derek McInnes' side in January.
And he has relished his time with the Dons.
"It's been amazing," he said. "I've enjoyed every minute of it, the training, the fans and just getting back on the field week-in, week-out.
"I'm happy that I've been able to add goals to my game in the latter part of the season as that was something I wanted to do.
"It's all positives that I've taken away from this experience.
"It's been a brilliant club to come into, a great changing-room and a real talented group of boys. I've really enjoyed my time here."
Christie revealed that Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has kept in touch with him during his loan spell and he now hopes to return to Glasgow and force his way into the champions' first team.
"That's the best case scenario, although I know it's going to be hard," he added.
"Celtic have been very dominant this season in every competition.
"Up until now, I've been thinking short-term and focusing on my games for Aberdeen and now I'll go away and have my break, return to Celtic for pre-season and we'll take it from there."
