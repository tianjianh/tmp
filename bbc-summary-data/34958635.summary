[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jose Mourinho says there is "no issue" with Diego Costa after leaving the striker on the bench against Tottenham.

Costa was dropped after netting just one goal in his last eight Chelsea matches and reacted angrily by tossing his substitute's bib at Mourinho.
But Blues boss Mourinho said: "For me his behaviour is normal. A top player on the bench will not be happy.
"If he wants to hurt me it would not be with a bib. I have a good relationship with him."

Mourinho defended his decision to name Costa, 27, as a substitute for Sunday's goalless draw at White Hart Lane, despite the striker scoring the winner against Norwich last weekend.
"I think Diego is very privileged," he said. "He is the last player to be on the bench. Everyone has been on the bench - the captain [John] Terry, [Branislav] Ivanovic, [Gary] Cahill, [Cesc] Fabregas, Pedro and player of the season [Eden] Hazard.
"Diego is privileged to have been kept in the team for all these matches and today we thought our best strategy was to play with this. I am happy with my decision and the players.
"[Today] Eden could play the 90 minutes and was so good and dangerous for us, I felt he could have scored a goal."
But Mourinho said he had no problem with the attitude of Spain international Costa.
"Diego is physically fine, no problems," he said. "He works well, every day his mood is positive, he is the positive guy in the team.
"I do not expect to have a player on the bench jumping and shouting because he is not playing."
