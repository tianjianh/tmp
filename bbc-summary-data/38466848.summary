RadioTimes.com voted for the scene from the Cornwall-set drama, where Ross Poldark - played by Aidan Turner - is bathed by wife Demelza, portrayed by Eleanor Tomlinson.
Turner takes the prize for a second year running, following his topless scything scene from series one in 2015.
More than 2,000 people took part in the online poll.
They were asked to choose from a shortlist of 35 clips said to be among the most dramatic, inspiring and emotional TV moments of the year.
