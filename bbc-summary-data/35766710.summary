Lee Clark says he has analysed Aberdeen and worked out a plan he hopes will help him claim his first win as Kilmarnock manager.

The Rugby Park side, currently in the relegation play-off spot, have gone four games without a win.
But Killie's outfield play has given Clark hope they can get a result at Pittodrie against the second-placed Scottish Premiership side.
"We go there with a lot of belief that we can win the match," said Clark.
"It's going to take a fantastic performance both with and without the ball.
"We've got a strong game-plan when we haven't got it, but when we have it, we have to be confident of creating chances and when we do start scoring with some of the chances that we do make."
Killie have failed to score in five of their last seven games, but 32-year-old Kris Boyd - a scorer on over 90 occasions for the club - did not make the substitutes' bench for Saturday's 2-0 loss to Ross County at Rugby Park.
However, Clark, says reputations count for nothing as far as claiming a place in his starting line-up.
"He's done it over the years, but it's the then and now - it's the now that is important," explained the Englishman.
"I wasn't a bad player 10 years ago, but I'm not going to be running out at Aberdeen on Saturday.
"It's about doing it now, and it's about what's been done in the weeks just gone by or just coming up. There are many, many players who've had great years gone by but we've got to deal with what's happening now.
"No, it wasn't an injury [for Boyd], I decided to go with Dale Carrick with his pace off the bench to stretch Ross County. When you get opportunities like that to get on the park you've got to make sure that you stay on the park for the up and coming games.
"I certainly don't look at what's gone on in the past, all that matters is now and in the future. That's the way you've got to deal with things as a manager and I've got to find a solution to putting those chances away.
"We made good chances at Hearts [in the 1-0 recent loss at Tynecastle] and didn't get on the scoresheet and before I got here scoring was a problem so everybody has to take responsibility for that."
