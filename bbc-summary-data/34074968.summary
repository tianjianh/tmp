The first major air show since the Shoreham disaster opened with a "pause for thought" for those who died.

Clacton Airshow's commentator paid tribute to the victims of Saturday's crash involving a vintage jet, which left up to 11 people dead.
Before flying began at Clacton, Peter McNamara sent "heartfelt respects to the residents of Shoreham".
Displays by the Red Arrows and the RAF Battle of Britain memorial flight will take place at the event.
Mr McNamara also spoke of the Shoreham air show's organisers who with the residents "have endured a very difficult and distressing time since Saturday".
"We now look forward to today's flying programme but will not forget the events of five days ago and their impact on so many lives," he added.
The Vulcan XH558 also took part in fly-pasts at RAF Mildenhall and RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk.
Neil Stock, the leader of Tendring District Council which organises the event, now in its 24th year, said the schedule had been approved by the Civil Aviation Authority earlier this week.
Vintage jets have been banned from carrying out "high-energy acrobatics" over land after what happened in Shoreham.
Mike Carran, Clacton Airshow's director, said flying takes place over the sea with a "huge exclusion zone", which means the show's programme has not had to be altered.
"We hone our plans every year, we're never complacent and we improve them all the time," he said.
"So, we're looking forward to a great family day out with a great line up."
