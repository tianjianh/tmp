The 19-year-old was part of Jose Mourinho's squad on their pre-season tour to North America and has now completed a move to Stamford Bridge.
"I very much enjoyed my time with the squad during pre-season and I am very grateful to Fluminense for allowing me this opportunity," said Kenedy.
"I am very happy to complete my transfer to Chelsea."
"It is an exciting time for me to join the English Premier League champions and I hope I can become an important player for the club."
Kenedy joins other Brazilians Ramires, Oscar and Willian at the club, while Nathan, who is also from Brazil, has moved on loan to Vitesse Arnhem after joining Chelsea in the summer.
