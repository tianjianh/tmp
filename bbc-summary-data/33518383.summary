A number of youths threw stones that broke windows on two buses in Greysteel on Monday evening.
No one was seriously hurt, although the police said one person had been injured.
A police investigation is now under way.
William Wray, from the City of Londonderry Grand Lodge, had family members on the bus.
"The window smashed and glass came in around the people," said Mr Wray.
"There were children on one of the buses - they were petrified. There was a lot of stress on the bus.
"We need community leaders in Greysteel to do something about this.
"I would be critical of the police - they weren't there for the return journey."
Londonderry mother of four, Shirley Hunter, was on one of the buses when it was attacked.
"We just heard a bang and the glass shattered - one man was sleeping and the glass went over him.
"I was sitting beside one of my daughters and the other was in front of me. One is aged 10 and one is 15.
"We just couldn't wait to get out of the area. I saw young boys throwing stones and it's down the parents to know where they are.
"As the bus moved the glass continued to shower over people. The kids were frightened.
"We don't talk about Catholics and Protestants at all. We were away for a family fun day.
"It was scary. I grew up in the Troubles but the children are still asking questions."
DUP MP Gregory Campbell said: "I was in the village yesterday and this has become a regular thing over the years.
"I was concerned about the lack of police in the area and I will be raising the issue with them.
"This was very serious. The driver could have been hit and 30 or 40 people could have been seriously injured."
SDLP MLA John Dallat said those responsible for the attacks should be "thoroughly ashamed of themselves".
"The behaviour at Greysteel should be condemned by everyone who genuinely reflects the right of people to travel to demonstrations whether it is in Derry city or indeed anywhere else in the North," he said.
"That right applies to all organisations and individuals irrespective of whether they are involved with the Orange Order, the Hibernians or indeed any legitimate organisation wishing to participate in cultural or musical events.
"Anyone who has respect for the good name of Greysteel and its wonderful people will want to protect the history and dignity of those people and not allow its reputation to be besmirched."
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said on Twitter that he unreservedly condemned those who attacked the bus.
Chief Supt Raymond Murray said: "An investigation is under way to find those responsible for the attack and I would appeal for anyone with any information to contact police on 101.
"Police will review the incident at Greysteel and address any issues that are identified, accordingly."
