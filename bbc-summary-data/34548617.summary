[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Trojan Horse' Park View pupils 'told wives must obey men'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils at a school embroiled in the so-called "Trojan Horse" scandal were handed leaflets saying Muslim women must obey men, a misconduct panel has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The claim was made by a former Park View staff member who resigned from the Birmingham school in October 2013.
Teachers Inamulhaq Anwar and Akeel Ahmed deny unacceptable conduct.
Park View was investigated amid claims of a plot by Muslim hard-liners to take control of several city schools.
Susan Packer told a National College for Teaching and Leadership panel she had become upset at reading the worksheet, and had heard of boys telling girls they had to obey them when they got married.
She said she raised her concerns with then-head teacher Lindsey Clark, who was "very dismissive".
Mrs Packer, the school's former public relations and enterprise co-ordinator, told the panel she not seen the sex education lessons, where the work sheet was allegedly handed out.
She also said she had misplaced a copy of the worksheet she had taken home.
Mrs Packer also claimed:
Mr Anwar, 34, and Mr Ahmed, 41, are both former Park View teachers who taught sex education.
They are said to have agreed with others, on or before 31 March 2014, to the inclusion of an undue amount of religious influence in pupils' education.
Mr Anwar is also accused of breaching recruiting policy.
Mrs Packer said they were amongst a group of men close to Moz Hussain who seemed to discuss things and follow each others' views.
She also listed several incidences she said reflected the changing ethos of Islam at the school, including:
Mrs Packer said she had resigned from the school after an Islamaphobia complaint was made against her.
The "Trojan Horse" allegations sparked several investigations including one by the Department for Education.
Park View was placed in special measures by Ofsted, and is now known as Rockwood Academy.
The hearing continues on Monday.
