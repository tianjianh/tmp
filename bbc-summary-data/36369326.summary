Pony and foal seeking home together in Aberdeenshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish SPCA is seeking a new home for a Shetland pony and her foal in Aberdeenshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three-year-old Missouri and six-week-old son Jefferson are being cared for at the charity's centre in Drumoak.
Centre manger Graeme Innes said: "Missouri had a rather round tummy when she arrived in our care and gave birth to the adorable Jefferson in April.
"We're surprised we haven't had any interest yet and we're hoping we can find this sweet pair a loving home."
Missouri's owner could no longer care for her.
Anyone who can offer Missouri and Jefferson a new home is asked to contact the Scottish SPCA's Aberdeenshire centre on 03000 999 999.
