The 24-year-old came through the club's academy making 182 appearances for the Seagulls but missed all of last season with an Achilles injury.
The central defender is set to compete with Steve Cook, Miles Addison, Stephane Zubar and Adam Barrett.
Elphick told the club website: "It's exciting, I've had a tough 14 months with injury, this is a new challenge."
