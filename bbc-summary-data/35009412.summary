Hermitage Academy reviews exam system after row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Changes could be made to the controversial way new school qualifications are put into practice at Hermitage Academy in Helensburgh.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some parents at the school are unhappy no pupils at the Argyll and Bute school get to sit exams in fourth year.
At most schools, students typically study for National 4 and 5 qualifications in fourth year.
A review by the council is suggesting that there should be more flexibility in the system.
A final decision is expected soon.
The way the new qualifications are put into practice at Hermitage is unusual.
In other schools, after taking exams in fourth year, those who are able to, then go on to study for Highers in fifth year.
But at Hermitage, students chose the six subjects they would eventually like to achieve a Higher in when they are in third year.
Then in fifth year, they are presented for the qualification they have the best chance of achieving.
This means students who might want to leave in fourth year do not get the chance to gain a qualification.
Some parents at the school also argue students are also losing out in fifth year - for instance because they have had little practice sitting exams - and are getting poorer results then than they should have.
Argyll and Bute Council has been carrying out a review of the curriculum at the school.
In a letter sent to parents on Friday, the council highlights planned action.
This includes the possibility of allowing students to gain qualifications in fourth year if this is the right thing for them.
Decisions on just what should happen are expected later.
The council's policy lead for education, Councillor Rory Colville, said the review recognised "many positive aspects to the current model" but also identified a range of improvements that could be implemented.
Mr Colville said: "Amongst a wide range of improvements the school will look to apply greater flexibility in the delivery of the current curricular pathways; improve tracking and monitoring of individual pupil progress to inform early and appropriate interventions and improve engagement with parents and pupils to develop a shared understanding of assessment and presentation policies.
''Wherever possible we have taken action as the review has progressed.
"A full outline of the findings and proposed actions can be found in a report to the Community Services Committee, available on the council website on Saturday. The committee will consider this paper at its meeting on Thursday 10 December.''
The council said it acknowledged that there was "a significant level of parental concern" about the way the new system had worked out at the school.
National 4 and 5 qualifications replaced Standard Grades across Scotland during the 2013-14 school year.
The new system is designed to be more flexible and the focus is now on the highest level of qualification a student achieves in each subject by the time they leave - not what they have by the end of a particular school year.
The argument is that a National 5 qualification is redundant once a student gets a Higher in a subject in the same way as an O Grade or Standard Grade was. But the question is whether studying for it, actually helped them to go on to get the Higher.
Many schools give able students the chance to bypass National 5 qualifications so they can spend two years working towards their Highers. Some believe this helps students to avoid a sudden increase in the difficulty of the course when they enter S5 so improves their chances of a good grade in the Higher.
However decisions on whether to go down this path are usually taken on a subject by subject basis by schools, students and parents.
A spokesman for the parents campaigning for change at the school said: "I welcome the findings of the report however hold judgement until the action plans are published and understood.
"Greater flexibility is what parents want for their children and we can only wait and see if the changes alluded to meet the parents wishes.
"I hope and wish that both the school and parents can move forward and develop a strong partnership for the benefit of the pupils now. However as I said once the action plans are understood then we will be in a better position to move forward."
