Scotland's Maguire had opened up a 6-2 advantage, but breaks of 114, 90 and 61 put him through to the last eight for the first time since 2012.
England's McLeod, who beat pre-tournament favourite Judd Trump in the first round, struggled throughout.
Elsewhere, Neil Robertson and Marco Fu are all square at 8-8.
Australia's Robertson, the 2010 champion, looked in fine form, stroking in breaks of 105, 90 and 62 to open up a 4-1 advantage.
But Hong Kong player Fu showed his battling qualities, compiling a superb 118 break followed by 60 to take three in a row and level.
In an absorbing second session, the pair made five breaks of 50+ which included Fu's 109 clearance. They resume on Monday at 19:00 BST.
Former champion Graeme Dott trails 2013 finalist Barry Hawkins 10-6, with that match playing to a finish on Monday from 13:00.
England's defending champion Mark Selby is 10-6 up against China's Xiao Guodong. They resume on Monday at 13:00.
Five-time ranking title winner Maguire has dropped to 24th in the world and came through three matches in qualifying.
He thumped fellow countryman Anthony McGill 10-2 in the first round, his first win at the Crucible Theatre since 2012 when he reached the semi-finals. Another comfortable victory on Sunday means he has an extra day off and faces Hawkins or Dott in the next round.
Maguire said: "It is nice knowing I don't have to get ready and worry about it. I am totally ready for the match. I don't fear anyone and if I play my game, I fancy winning.
"I have never been in the final so I cannot say I fancy winning it, I don't know what it takes."
McLeod never got going - falling 5-0 behind - and blamed his shock win over Trump for his poor performance.
"I was distracted after my first-round win and all the commotion around it.
"All the hype from it distracted me, I should have just locked myself away and not get involved."
