[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Bennett, of Lingholme, Redcar, was at Teesside Magistrates' Court for the short hearing during which he confirmed his name and address.
He is accused of murdering Lynne Freeman, 46, and 30-year-old Jodie Betteridge, on Wednesday evening.
He was remanded in custody and will appear at Teesside Crown Court on 29 March.
Police were called to Mapleton Crescent, where Mrs Freeman lived on Wednesday evening, then seven minutes later to Ms Betteridge's address in Byland Close.
Ms Freeman's children Sarah Helm, 28, James Helm, 27, Kimberley Helm, 25 and Lauren Freeman, 18, previously said in a statement: "We shouldn't have to be writing a tribute to our mother who was taken from us so early. She should still be here to watch her four kids and grandkids grow."
In tribute to Ms Betteridge, Theresa Largan, 51, said: "Jodie lived for her kids. I don't think I ever saw her on her own, she always had the tribe with her."
