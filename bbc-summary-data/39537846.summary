What do you think of Harry's new single?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harry Styles has finally unveiled his new single called Sign Of The Times.

It's his first song since his boy band One Direction announced they were taking a break in January 2016.
He told BBC Radio 1, which played the track: "It's the song I'm most proud of writing."
After Jenny went to find out what some kids in Liverpool thought about the track, we want to hear from some of you!

I quite like Harry's new single but the only thing is that it is a bit sad.

It's very slow and I think that's because he's still sad about the split-up with his former band. If he made it more lively, it would improve a lot!

Harry's new album is great! The song is well-written and I like the beginning as it starts slow and then gets a bit faster and  slow again. Zayn's and Niall's singles were great as well. You can't compare them to Harry's solo as all of them have different style.

We'll I'm not a big fan of Harry styles and I don't like his new single on his own. sorry to all of his fans.

I love Harry Styles' new single,  I am his biggest fan and the way the music matches his voice is just beautiful.

When Harry was on 1D, I liked his vocals a little bit but now I just think they are dreadful.
