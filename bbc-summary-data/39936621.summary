The 25-year-old was left without a club when Notts County folded in April, a day before the start of the Women's Super League Spring Series.
The former Doncaster Rovers Belles player is now looking forward to helping Liverpool maintain their unbeaten start after four games.
"Hopefully I am able to make the squad even stronger," said Turner.
"This is a fantastic move for me and I'm really excited to join up with the squad.
"Liverpool Ladies are a team with big ambitions and I am confident that we can have a successful end to the Spring Series before the full season starts in September."
Turner made her debut for England at the 2015 Cyprus Cup after Casey Stoney withdrew through injury and has collected three caps since.
Liverpool manager Scott Rogers added: "Amy is a versatile defender who is equally comfortable at full-back or as a central defender so this is another great signing for the club."
Liverpool are top of the Spring Series table, three points ahead of Manchester City after three wins and a draw. Their next game is at home to Sunderland on Wednesday (19:00 BST kick-off).
