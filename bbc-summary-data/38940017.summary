[SN]TITLE[SN]
Middlesbrough v Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gaston Ramirez is available to make his first start for Middlesbrough since 2 January after returning from injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adlene Guedioura is cup-tied and Antonio Barragan is out, but George Friend returns after missing three weeks with a calf problem.
There are no new injury concerns for Oxford, who have defender Joe Skarz available following illness.
Christian Ribeiro and Sam Long remain sidelined, although in-form Kane Hemmings is set to start.
Robyn Cowen: "Premier League survival remains the priority for Middlesbrough, so their increasingly tenuous position in the table might lessen their commitment to this fifth-round tie against Oxford United.
"Aitor Karanka's side should not underestimate their League One opponents. Oxford's form in cup competitions this season has been outstanding. As well as their FA Cup exploits, they're into the semi-final of the EFL Trophy and a late push for the play-offs is also in their sights.
"It remains to be seen whether juggling three separate competitions will finally prove too much for the U's, but Michael Appleton's men have already conquered the big team from Tyneside; could Teesside be next?"

Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka: "I always said that, for me, every competition is important. The FA Cup is an amazing trophy. We have to keep our belief and keep dreaming.
"Roberto [Martinez] won the title with Wigan and that shows it can be done. Our main aim is to stay in the Premier League this season, but for this week my priority is the cup.
"Our players are intelligent and know this is a good opportunity to go through. But to reach the next round we have to be at our best."
Oxford manager Michael Appleton: "We've beaten eight sides from a higher division, one of them a Premier League side. We give sides above us a really good game. We've got players that can play at that level. On a one-off, in a cup competition, they've proved they can do it.
"The cup competitions have been good to us. Some people see them as a distraction and they can be for some clubs, but we view it completely differently."
This is an absolute free hit for Oxford. I would love my old team to get through, but I fear this might be a hurdle too far.
Prediction: 2-1
