After receiving a bye in the first round, Britain's London 2012 gold medallist proved too classy for Kob.
Quick on her feet and dangerous with the jab, Adams dominated the flyweight bout, though Kob was aggressive and impressive working on the inside.

Adams faces a semi-final against Canada's Mandy Bujold or China's Cancan Ran, whom she beat in the London final.
Defeated semi-finalists do not fight again and both receive bronze medals.
Adams is aiming to become the first British boxer to retain an Olympic title for 92 years.
"Once you get the first fight out of the way, you get rid of the ring-rust," Adams told the BBC.
"I wasn't at my best there but I'll improve as the competition goes on."
