[SN]TITLE[SN]
Most senior woman bishop consecrated in Canterbury service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The most senior woman bishop in the Church of England is to be consecrated at Canterbury Cathedral later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Venerable Rachel Treweek, 52, who is Archdeacon of Hackney in the Diocese of London, will become the new Bishop of Gloucester.
Two women bishops have already been appointed, but Archdeacon Treweek is the first woman to run a diocese and will be one rank below archbishop.
She is succeeding The Right Reverend Michael Perham, who retired last year.
Representatives and clergy from churches across Gloucestershire are expected to be in attendance to welcome the new bishop to the diocese.
She is expected to join a procession to the cathedral before being consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury and giving her first sermon.
It is understood she will also become the first female bishop to enter the House of Lords.
Archdeacon Treweek said it was "an immense joy and privilege" when she was appointed to the role in March.
The Church formally adopted legislation to allow women bishops last November.
