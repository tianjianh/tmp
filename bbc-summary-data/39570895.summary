It's almost Easter and bunnies are everywhere you look - but animal charities want to remind people that real rabbits take a lot of looking after.

Last year, the RSPCA had to rescue more than 3,000 rabbits and almost 1,000 of them had been abandoned.
Some pet shops are worried that at this time of year people might want to buy a rabbit, without understanding how much care they need.
So some stores are not selling rabbits over Easter to help stop this.
Ricky has been to an animal rescue centre to meet some rabbits and find out how much care they need.
