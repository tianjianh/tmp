Heroin courier Marcus Kelman jailed for five years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drugs courier who was caught with £53,000 worth of heroin has been jailed for five years and seven months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marcus Kelman, 44, from Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, was caught with the Class A drug in a van in Renfield Street, Renfrew, on 9 November 2015.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that police officers became suspicious as Kelman had double parked outside a house connected with drug dealing.
Judge Lady Scott noted this was his third drugs offence conviction.
The court heard that after becoming suspicious police followed Kelman before stopping his van.
The officers found £450 in cash and a box with brown powder inside which they suspected was heroin but Kelman claimed was chocolate protein.
When Kelman was arrested he stated he was "going down for this" as this was his "third strike".
Kelman later claimed he had agreed to act as a courier as he owned money.
It emerged that Kelman was jailed for drugs offences for four years in 2008 in the High Court in Glasgow and for two years in 2012 at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
It also emerged that in May 2005, a civil action brought by the Crown resulted in the confiscation of the Kelman's two Glasgow flats, £40,000 from his bank account and a £4,000 diamond encrusted watch.
That action was taken despite Kelman's not guilty plea to drug dealing charges being accepted at the High Court in Glasgow in May 2004.
