Glasgow bin lorry tragedy: a city remembers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For many in George Square at 14:29 on Tuesday, the atmosphere was one of Christmas cheer.

Most were unaware that it was exactly one year since the Glasgow bin lorry tragedy, but there were many who had remembered.
They gathered around the fair in George Square, in darkness as a mark of respect, and the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art.
They stood in silence to remember those who had been affected by the tragedy.
A woman stood beside the road on Queen Street sobbing heavily, comforted by a companion.
Another quietly sobbed as she looked at the floral tributes outside the Gallery of Modern Art.
Many more stopped for a minute as they walked past the flowers to read the messages left with them.
Some of the flowers had been left by friends and relatives who were affected by the tragedy but most were placed anonymously by members of the public.
They served as a reminder for many of the shoppers and and city-centre workers who may otherwise have forgotten the tragedy's first anniversary.
Several times today, passers-by questioned their companions about why the flowers had been laid.
Some did not know, but when the bin lorry crash was referenced usually it was followed by a respectful silence.
It was an overcast day in George Square, but the scene was brightened by a big bunch of yellow flowers.
They were laid by two young colleagues of Erin McQuade, who was 18 when she died in the tragedy.
The pair worked with her at Cameron House.
As they laid the bunch of yellow flowers outside of the Gallery of Modern Art, one said: "We picked these flowers because they were so bright and we thought it was a nice way to remember her on what is obviously a sad day.
"It has really affected all of her colleagues. Although we went to her funeral, we also had a night out to our local pub as a way of remembering her.
"She was genuinely the nicest person I have ever met - she was so funny."
Another mourner, Jane McIntyre, said she did not know any of the victims, but she felt it was important to remember them and their families, especially because of the time of year.
As she laid a bunch of roses, she said: "I came last year with my daughter to lay flowers on Boxing Day, because all I could think about on Christmas Day when I was standing cutting my sprouts was that poor woman who lost her daughter and both of her parents.
"I've brought my daughter back today because I'll never, ever forget this day. It's just so sad. If that was me I don't think I'd ever be able to celebrate Christmas again."
She laid her flowers next to those left by Glasgow's Lord Provost Sadie Docherty.
Ms Docherty's message said: "Always in our thoughts and prayers. The Lord Provost of Glasgow, Sadie Docherty."
