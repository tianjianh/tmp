Jann Mardenborough crashed his Nissan GTR Nismo in the first race of the season at the Nurburgring Nordschleife.
The team said the 23-year-old was upset by what had happened.
He has been released from hospital, along with two injured spectators, and Nissan Nismo said it is co-operating with the investigation.
"Everyone at Nissan would like to again extend their deepest sympathies to the family of the deceased and to the spectators who were hurt," the team said in a statement.
"Nissan would also like to thank everyone for the support they have shown for the fans involved, the team and for Jann Mardenborough."
Mardenborough's car flipped and left the track at high speed as it negotiated the Flugplatz section of the circuit on Saturday.
After crashing through the trackside fencing, it landed on its roof in a spectator area.
Mardenborough, whose father Steve played football for Wolves, Coventry, Cardiff and Swansea, began racing in 2011 when he beat 90,000 entrants to win the GT Academy, a video game competition.
He has since competed in the British GT Championship, Le Mans 24-Hours and the 2014 GP3 series.
