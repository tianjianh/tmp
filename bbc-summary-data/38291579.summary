Premiership side Sale Sharks have announced the cross-code signing of Castleford Tigers winger Denny Solomona on a three-year deal.

The 23-year-old was registered in Sale's Champions Cup squad last week despite the move not being confirmed.
Cas are taking legal action after Solomona did not report for pre-season having "resigned" from rugby league with two years left on his contract.
"He is a great player," said Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond.
"He has an eye for scoring tries and has the added bonus of having played rugby union in his time at school and college."
Solomona broke Lesley Vainikolo's record for the most tries in a Super League season this year when he crossed 40 times.
He has joined fellow winger Josh Charnley in making the switch to the 15-a-side game with Sharks.
Despite the deal being done, BBC Sport understands that Sale could end up paying Castleford a compensation fee for signing Solomona.
The Tigers are prepared to take the issue to the High Court and have appointed London barrister Nick Randall QC and Leeds-based sports lawyer Richard Cramer to fight their case.
Rugby Football League chief executive Nigel Wood spoke about his concerns about the "implications for the game" because of Solomona's breach of contract.
The RFL have discussed the transfer with the Rugby Football Union and Premiership Rugby.
New Zealand-born Solomona, who made his Samoa debut in a rugby league international against Fiji in October, was contracted to Castleford until 2018.
