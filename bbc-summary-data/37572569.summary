Andrew Benain approached a couple for drugs in a Birmingham street but police said the pair fled with his Â£80.
In a rage, he chased them across a park in his vehicle, causing "catastrophic" leg injuries to the woman when she fell and he accelerated over her.
At Birmingham Crown Court, Benain admitted wounding with intent.
He also admitted dangerous driving.

The actions of the 40 year old, from Oldbury, caused multiple fractures to the woman's pelvis and ruptured her bladder and bowel.
Investigating officer Det Con Sarah Evans said the incident, on 25 September last year, could have ended in a murder inquiry as the woman was only freed when her partner dragged her away from the VW Touran.
Nearby officers who went to the Ladywood park after hearing the commotion had to jump for cover as Benain drove around trying to escape before exiting through a wooden fence.
He was arrested when police traced him to his home address.
Ms Evans said: "In interview, Benain claimed he was asleep at the time of the incident and that he'd sold the Touran days earlier to a man he knew only as 'Slim'.
"However, in the face of the evidence we presented he eventually changed his story and admitted being the driver.
"This was an outrageous act and a gross over-reactionâ€¦ he has now paid the price and will have plenty of time in prison to consider his actions.
"I wish the victim well in her continued recovery."
