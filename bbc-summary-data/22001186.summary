Rail travellers at Reading have been hit by further delays after station redevelopment work overran.

Over the past 10 days, trains to London Paddington were cancelled and other services severely reduced while part of a Â£895m upgrade was carried out.
However the work was extended by an hour due to signalling issues on Tuesday while a broken down train in Oxfordshire added to rush-hour delays.
The station has four new platforms, two entrances and a new link bridge.
Passenger Jim Barrow, from Oxford, who missed his connection to Windsor because of the delay said: "It's useless, but what you expect after the weekend."
Sarah East from Tilehurst who was at Reading to meet her sister on a delayed train from Tiverton, described the new-look station as "rather beautiful".
"We were confused when we arrived at the back, but it's amazing what they've done, fantastic and should be good for Reading."
Train timetables over the next week remain revised while work continues on several platforms.
Works started in spring 2011 and are on course to be completed a year ahead of schedule in 2015.
