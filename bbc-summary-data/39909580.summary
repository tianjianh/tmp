[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joe Hart was beaten five times as Napoli thrashed Torino to boost their chances of earning a spot in the Champions League group stages.

Jose Callejon slotted home an early opener, with Lorenzo Insigne smashing home a second after an hour.
Dries Mertens then beat Hart at his near post to finish a good move, before Callejon got his second and Piotr Zielinski completed the rout.
Napoli go above rivals Roma into second spot in Serie A - for now at least.
Roma will move back into second if they beat Juventus later on Sunday (19:45 BST). If Juventus draw or win that game, they will clinch the Serie A title - for a record sixth consecutive season.
Earlier this week, Torino president Urbano Cairo admitted he "didn't expect so many mistakes from Joe Hart", who is on loan from Manchester City.
