The engineering firm says the £250m expansion of its Malmesbury headquarters will eventually bring 3,000 new jobs to the town.
Planning conditions have been added regarding archaeological issues and addressing site access, along with concerns about increased traffic.
The expansion is expected to be the largest in the firm's 20-year history.
A spokesperson for Dyson said the decision was just one part of a number of stages in the planning process and they did not want to comment further.
