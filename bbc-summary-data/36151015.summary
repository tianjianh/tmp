[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shane Tunney, 24, from Stockton, suffered severe head injuries during the assault on Norton High Street on 27 June last year and later died.
The 17-year-old, who cannot be named, was spotted on CCTV with the six other defendants running after Mr Tunney.
But he told Teesside Crown Court he took no part in the fatal assault.
The jury has heard how Mr Tunney was set upon by a gang and died from his injuries in hospital five weeks later.
The teenager was asked by his barrister, Jamie Hill QC, whether he saw what happened to Mr Tunney.
He replied: "I saw him being kicked."
He was then asked if he had seen who did the kicking.
The teenager said: "No, I couldn't say."
Earlier, the court heard food had been thrown at Mr Tunney and friend Anthony Kirk as they used a cash machine.
A short time later they were set upon by a group and Mr Kirk was stuck on the side of the head with a metal pole, and then kicked and punched while on the ground.
When the gang ran off, he found Mr Tunney unconscious.
Four 18-year olds, Kearon Terry Davis, of Trent Street; Kieran Harry Davis, of Holme House Road, Jake Douglas of David Road and Brandon Pitt, of Tithe Barn Road, all from Stockton, are accused, alongside two 17-year-olds and one 16-year-old, who cannot be named.
All deny murder and attempted grievous bodily harm..
The trial continues.
