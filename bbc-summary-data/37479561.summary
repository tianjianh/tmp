The Hornets let in goals from a corner and a cross as they suffered a third Premier League defeat in six games.
The last seven goals the team have conceded in the top flight have come from crosses.
"People need to take responsibility," said Deeney. "Look at [goalscorer] Michael Keane - he wanted it more than the other boys involved."
Jeff Hendrick and Keane both scored from Steven Defour deliveries as the Clarets moved level with Watford on seven points.
The defeat for the Hornets came after wins over West Ham and Manchester United.
"It is not the first time we have let in a goal from a corner so questions need to be asked and people need to be held accountable," added Deeney, 28.
"It was not good enough. We just didn't turn up. We got bullied to a man all over the pitch and played right into their hands."
