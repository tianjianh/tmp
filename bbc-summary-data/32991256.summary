[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Newry-based firm First Derivatives has reported a rise in pre-tax profits of 120%.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The financial technology company made Â£17.5m for the year to the end of February.
First Derivatives employs around 1,200 people across the world.
It is one of only two publicly listed companies in Northern Ireland.
It has had a busy year in terms of acquisitions.
It bought a series of companies including Kx Systems in California in October 2014.
And it has made a further three purchases since the start of this year - Prelytix in Massachussetts, Dublin software firm ActivateClients and Affinity Systems in Ontario.
Seamus Keating, chairman of First Derivatives, said the purchase of a majority stake in Kx Systems enabled the group to "broaden its strategy".
He said: "The subsequent investment across the business, including three strategic acquisitions in 2015, positions First Derivatives as a leading player in big fast data across multiple vertical markets.
"This has been achieved while maintaining a strong focus on current trading, with a strong second-half performance from both our consulting and software activities, enabling the group to report record results and upgrade expectations for the current financial year."
