BBC Wiltshire report the 23-year-old forward left Sixfields before kick-off, having been told he wasn't involved in the squad for the League One match.
Head coach Luke Williams said the matter would be dealt with "in house".
The Robins are in the relegation zone after five straight losses, four points from safety, with 14 matches remaining.
Swindon have won three, drawn four and lost 11 of their 18 games in all competitions since Tim Sherwood's appointment as director of football on 10 November.
