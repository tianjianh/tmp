St Comhghall's: Lisnaskea school programme opens classrooms to parents

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Fermanagh school has opened its classrooms to parents as part of a programme to support families.

A dozen families have completed the Families and Schools Together (FAST) project at St Comhghall's in Lisnaskea.
The school is in an area with high levels of rural deprivation. 43% of its pupils receive free school meals, so it gets extra funding to help pupils to achieve their best.
The scheme has been developed by Middlesex University in London.
Principal Gary Kelly said it was important for both students and parents to recognise the value of education.
"If we can get the parents to get involved in the school, they can help their youngsters out, they see the value of education, they see the importance of school, and they encourage their youngsters and their children to work harder in school, to achieve more," he said.
"School as far as we would see is no longer the scary place for parents - it's an open door policy."
During the 10-week scheme, parents, pupils and younger brothers and sisters all take part in weekly activities at the school, and each week one family cooks a meal for all of the others.
The parents are offered lessons in computers, cooking, health and sports as well as having one-to-one time with their children to discuss any problems they might be having.
The Moran family is one of those taking part, and mum Helena says it is an opportunity to spend valuable time together.
"I don't see my children, I lift them from school when I finish work, straight into homework, straight in to dinner and they're gone, football, soccer, Gaelic and dancing," she said.
"So I know on a Thursday evening that I have two-and-a-half hours where they can't go anywhere, that they're here and other than that you don't spend time as a family because everybody is too busy."
Anne-Marie Pennell is another parent who feels her relationship with her son Ryan has improved through taking part in the programme.
"I find myself and Ryan communicate much better and he feels maybe that this is the time that if there's anything worrying him during the week he will come now for those 15 minutes to talk about it," she said.
Her six-year-old twin daughters also love having the chance to come to their older brother's school to mix with other children.
Dr Carmel Clancy from Middlesex University said the FAST programme is offered in 2,000 schools in 14 countries and brings benefits to children beyond the classroom.
She said: "They actually achieve more in the school both educationally, in terms of their attainment but just wider social skills.
"We see better parent/child relationships, we see community relationships with the school increasing.
"We have community partners who participate so they get to know their local school, their local families, so it really is that explosion of network."
The families were presented with certificates by the Education Minister John O'Dowd at a graduation ceremony to mark the completion of the programme in Lisnaskea.
St Comhghall's received extra funding for schemes such as FAST through the extended schools programme, but it also relied on sponsorship from businesses in the local community.
The education minister said that schools will increasingly need to find alternative sources of funding for extra-curricular activities.
