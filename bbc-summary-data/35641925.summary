Bottom-of-the-table London Irish have not won away from home in the Premiership since 28 February 2015.
The Exiles welcome back Scotland duo Sean Maitland and Blair Cowan as the only changes from the defeat by Exeter.
Leicester have lost their last three games in the Premiership, but have not lost four in succession since the 2003-04 season.
Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester:
"We are going to make the right choices at the right times and be more accurate. There is nothing wrong with how we are playing, it's how we are executing.
"There is a bit of learning in that, but we have to learn very quickly. It is not acceptable that we keep making those errors three weeks on the trot.
"We have to take our physicality to another level - and we did that at the weekend - but that should be a given. We need to be smarter and make better choices. We have done that in lots of games. Three poor results does not mean we are a poor team.
"Sunday is a huge game and we have to win. It is now time to show some character."
London Irish assistant coach Clark Laidlaw told BBC Radio Berkshire:
"We're certainly having a real good look at preparation in terms of an away game.
"We've talked a lot around how tactically we approach the game against Leicester. Getting the balance between kicking and gaining territory, as well as our attacking game.
"It's been a long time between drinks (winning) away from home, but we're certainly working on getting our preparation and our tactics right.
"The mentality has to be right away from home as Welford Road is a tough place to go."
