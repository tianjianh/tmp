Messi finally matched Telmo Zarra's 251 goals with a fantastic free-kick, having failed to score in his last three La Liga matches.
Sevilla levelled through a Jordi Alba own goal, but Neymar made it 2-1.
Ivan Rakitic scored a header before Messi's record breaker from a counter-attack and goal number 253 came after a one-two with Neymar.
The 27-year-old's goal tally is all the more remarkable given his goals have come in only 250 starts for Barcelona.
Earlier in the month, Messi drew level with Raul's all-time Champions League record of 71 goals after scoring twice in Barcelona's 2-0 victory against Ajax.
"Messi is without doubt the best player I've seen as a player and a coach," said Barca manager Luis Enrique after that feat.
Against Sevilla he was in irresistible form, equalling the record with a breathtaking free-kick around the wall and past goalkeeper Beto to give Barca a 1-0 lead.
He struck again from close range in the 72nd minute and scored a third goal six minutes later with a powerful low drive from the edge of the penalty area.
After scoring the goal that took him past Zarra's total, Messi's team-mates picked him up and threw him into the air several times while the crowd at the Nou Camp roared its approval.
The legendary Zarra scored 251 goals in a 15-year stay at Athletic Bilbao in the 1940s and 50s.
Messi, who joined Barca's academy at the age of 13, has taken 10 seasons to overhaul Zarra - also setting a record for goals in a single campaign with 50 in 2011-12.
The Argentine became became the third-youngest player to play for Barcelona when he made his debut aged 17 years and 114 days in October 2004 and scored his first senior goal for the club against Albacete Balompie the following May.
