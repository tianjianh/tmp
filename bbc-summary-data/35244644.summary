Dr Addenbrooke's Cambridge legacy hospital 250 years on

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two hundred and fifty years ago to the day, a 20-bed hospital in Cambridge "for poor people" opened its doors to patients.

Now, Addenbrooke's Hospital treats nearly 900,000 patients a year, has an income of more than £719m and is Cambridge University's teaching hospital.
It will mark its anniversary by opening a museum at the hospital, using papers and artefacts from its archive.
Cambridge University Hospital's archivist Hilary Ritchie said one of the exhibits included a ledger from the day of its opening.
"We have the first minute book [from] 13 October 1766 and like all the other paper archives, it has never been on display before," she added.
The original building on Trumpington Street was funded by a bequest of £4,500 - worth about £13m today - from necromancer and St Catharine's College, Cambridge fellow, Dr John Addenbrooke, who died aged 39 in 1719.
Miss Ritchie said not much was known about him.
She added: "He was a very mysterious man and burnt all his documents, including a portrait, before he died."
In the later 19th Century, the hospital strengthened its links with the University of Cambridge, due to the work of physician George Paget and surgeon George Humphry.
However, when they died the connection ended.
Miss Ritchie said: "University students would do the theory here and do their clinical practice in London because they didn't think that the right kind of patient came to Addenbrooke's."
The hospital began its move to its current site on Hills Road in 1961, which included a neurological centre and "that's when it all changed".
Surgeon Roy Calne developed links with Terence English at nearby Papworth Hospital, to expand the hospital's transplant programme. The world's first heart, lung and liver transplant took place jointly with Papworth in 1986.
Addenbrooke's Hospital is now part of Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, including the Rosie Maternity Unit.
The trust, which has a deficit of £32.3m, has had a troubled few years after Dr Myles Bradbury was convicted of abusing young cancer patients.
In 2015, the Care Quality Commission found its governance to be inadequate - although it rated the quality of its care as outstanding.
Following an inspection in May, the rating was lifted to "requires improvement".
