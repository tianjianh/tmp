England women have made six changes for their Pool B World Cup decider with the USA in Dublin on Thursday.

Both sides are unbeaten and the winner of the match will automatically qualify for next week's semi-finals in Belfast.
Sarah Hunter returns to captain the side at number eight, while prop Sarah Bern has recovered from a sprained ankle to start at tight-head.
Kay Wilson, who scored four tries in the opening 56-5 win against Spain, returns to the wing.
Full-back Danielle Waterman is the only player to have started every game for the reigning world champions.
"I believe we've got a strong enough squad to make sure we get the job done and done well, but we're under no illusion that it will be an easy contest," she said.
Hooker Vicky Fleetwood will start from the bench after joining up late with the squad as she continues to recover from a knee ligament injury.
"This is a winner-takes-all game in terms of topping the pool and will require a full effort from the squad to get the job done," said head coach Simon Middleton.
Following the Spain victory, England beat Italy 56-13 on Sunday, while the USA beat Italy 24-12 and Spain 43-0 in their two pool games.
Middleton added: "We know playing against USA will be tough. They play a very physical game and have some dangerous players on the ball, but we have prepared well and the squad are in a good place, not only physically but mentally.
"We have confidence in the entire squad and it's now about going out and making sure we put in a full 80-minute performance."
The Red Roses have played USA in four previous World Cups, winning three and losing once.
While England have been in full-flow on the try-scoring front during the tournament, putting ten tries past both Italy and Spain, there has been criticism of their place kicking.
England captain and first choice goal-kicker Emily Scarratt has only managed a 27% success rate from the tee.
In 2014, when England were crowned World Champions, Scarratt's right boot was often credited with being the difference between England and their opponents.
But Middleton has rushed to the defence of the centre: "Emily doesn't get phased, she's very confident in her own ability and we're very confident in her," he said.
"We've scored an awful lot of tries out on the flanks, it makes goal kicking very difficult. Emily's been very close with a lot of her kicks.
He added: "She asked the other day 'are you ok with me leading the goal-kicking?' I said 'yes, absolutely', because I know she'll get it right."
England team: Danielle Waterman, Amy Wilson Hardy, Emily Scarratt, Amber Reed, Kay Wilson, Katy Mclean, Natasha Hunt; Vickii Cornborough, Amy Cokayne, Sarah Bern. Abbie Scott, Tamara Taylor, Alex Matthews, Marlie Packer, Sarah Hunter.
Replacements: Vicky Fleetwood, Rochelle Clark, Justine Lucas, Poppy Cleall, Harriet Millar-Mills, Leanne Riley, Rachael Burford, Megan Jones.
