Author George RR Martin's epic science fiction story series Wild Cards is to be developed for TV following the success of Game of Thrones.

The 22 volumes imagine a scenario in which an alien virus spread across the Earth after World War Two.
Most humans are wiped out, some are left deformed and 1% gain superpowers, which they may use for good or evil.
The TV rights have been bought by Universal Cable Productions, which was behind shows like Psych and Mr Robot.
"Development will begin immediately on what we hope will be the first of several interlocking series," Martin wrote.
The author has enlisted more than 30 writers to join him in contributing to the Wild Cards anthologies, graphic novels and games since the series began in 1986.
"Most of all it is a universe, as large and diverse and exciting as the comic book universes of Marvel and DC (though somewhat grittier, and considerably more realistic and more consistent), with an enormous cast of characters both major and minor," Martin wrote.
"There are thousands of stories to be told in the world of the Wild Cards."
Martin will not work on the series himself because he has an exclusive development deal with HBO, but will hand it over to Wild Cards assistant editor and writer Melinda Snodgrass and former DC Comics and Syfy Films writer and producer Gregory Noveck.
"They know and love the Wild Cards universe almost as well as I do, and I think they will do a terrific job," Martin said. "Wish them luck."
