A Facebook post describing attacks on Christopher Cooper's son and daughter drew worldwide attention earlier this year when it was shared 200,000 times.
Furness Magistrates' Court heard in the following weeks he then jabbed his finger towards the alleged bully's face outside North Walney Primary School.
Mr Cooper, of Walney, Cumbria, admitted a Section 5 public order offence.
District Judge Gerald Chalk said it was ironic that in complaining about bullying, Mr Cooper had used bullying behaviour himself.
Speaking outside court after the sentencing, Mr Cooper, 37, said the school and Cumbria Police had failed to act when he repeatedly raised concerns his children were being targeted.
"When you're let down by two institutions that are there to protect your children, then you're left with no option," he said.
In addition to the two-year restraining order, he was ordered to pay a Â£120 fine, Â£85 court costs and a Â£20 victim surcharge.
Supt Rob O'Connor said: "We understand Mr Cooper had his children's welfare as priority and that parents will sympathise with his desire to protect them.
"However, this case has shown that there is no excuse to take the law into your own hands."
In a statement in March, the school said it did not accept Mr Cooper's description of its actions.
It said: "Our understanding to date was that while he was understandably angry that incidents had occurred, he was satisfied with the actions of the school and the plans put in place."
