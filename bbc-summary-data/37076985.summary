However, no weapons were found in or near the plot at Brandwood End Cemetery in Kings Heath.
West Midlands Police said it had received "credible evidence" that firearms were near the grave.
A spokesman stressed the coffin remained untouched throughout, the family of the deceased were informed and no machines were used.
The intelligence had been corroborated by a scan of the ground before the search was made, the spokesman said.
The grave is thought to have been that of a stabbing victim who died several years ago. It was examined while the cemetery was closed on May 27, police said.
"West Midlands Police obtained a licence from the Ministry of Justice earlier this year to excavate a grave plot in Birmingham," a spokesman said.
"The excavation happened in private, behind a screen, while the cemetery was closed and the team carried out the search with the utmost sensitivity and respect.
"We suspected potential weapons were just a couple of feet below the surface of the ground and it's our duty to ensure they don't end up in the wrong hands."
