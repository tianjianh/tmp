Mooney, 33, scored 963 runs in 64 one-day internationals, and 231 across 27 Twenty20 matches for Ireland.
"A business opportunity has arisen which I must pursue," said the Dubliner.
He added: "I've always given 100% to the team, and it wouldn't be fair on them to keep going if I'm not fully committed."
Mooney, who also took 48 wickets in ODI competition, and 10 in the T20 format for Ireland, added: "I've been playing internationally for 14 years and over the past few seasons have found that the intensity and demands of the modern game have placed a considerable strain on my body.
"It's also become increasingly difficult to spend such long periods of time away from my wife and young family."
Mooney is one of only four Irish players to play in three World Cups, along with the O'Brien brothers and Irish skipper William Porterfield.
The highlight came in 2011 when Mooney secured a stunning victory for Ireland against England in Bangalore.
"I've some fantastic memories having played in three World Cups, the first of which in 2007 included my elder brother Paul," said the North County player, who designed his own helmet which he wore at this year's tournament.
"In 2011 I also had what I described as my 'Ray Houghton moment', hitting the winning runs against England."
