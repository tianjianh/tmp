Former Paralympic rowing champion Tom Aggar has retired after 10 years in the sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aggar, 32, began rowing after an accident left him paralysed in 2005.
He won Paralympic gold in the arms-shoulders single scull in Beijing in 2008 and took bronze in Rio last year.
"Rowing has shaped my life in so many ways. I will miss being alongside the team as they push towards Tokyo," said the four-time world champion from London.
