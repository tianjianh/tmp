Greece crisis: Flowers and problems for Merkel's birthday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is Angela Merkel's 61st birthday. Friday's vote on the Greek bailout talks may have gone the chancellor's way but I suspect she is in no mood to celebrate.

This is thought to be one of the most difficult votes of her chancellorship.
More than 100 MPs voted against her proposal. Compare that to the vote over the controversial decision to end nuclear energy production, when about 70 MPs voted against her.
But what will concern the chancellor even more is the rebellion she faced from within the ranks of her own party.
She was defied by 60 conservative MPs who voted against the motion for Germany to take part in negotiations over a new â‚¬86bn (Â£60bn) bailout deal for Greece.
One of them told me nothing would have persuaded him to change his mind.
"This is money for our children and grandchildren," said Klaus-Peter Willsch.
Like many, he is finding it hard to persuade his constituents of the benefits of a bailout package.
A poll this morning revealed 49% of Germans think it is a mistake to even enter negotiations over a deal.
The majority of Germans do not trust the government of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to deliver promised reforms in exchange for more money.
Other MPs voted yes - but with a heavy heart. One told me afterwards he did not think this was the end of the crisis. Ralf Brinkhaus said he anticipated there would be more bailouts for Greece.
Why did he vote yes?
"Because," he answered "We're Europeans".
Mrs Merkel has often been described as "unter druck" ("under pressure" in English) by the German media in the last few weeks. Her approval ratings have taken a hit but as one pollster here told me it is not significant.
She still enjoys some of the highest approval ratings of any world leader. Peter Mattuschek from the polling agency Forsa, says people see her as a crisis manager.
Significantly, there is no one waiting to challenge Mrs Merkel for the chancellorship.
Even Klaus-Peter Willsch agrees; he and his constituents may disapprove of a move towards a third bailout but he believes the "Iron Chancellor" will remain unscathed.
