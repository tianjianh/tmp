Raith Rovers 0-1 Alloa Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Raith Rovers striker Greig Spence scored the only goal of the game to knock his old team out of the league cup.

The crucial moment came in 34 minutes when Spence sped clear of the sluggish Raith back line to rattle in his third goal of the competition.
The win sees Alloa top Group D with a 100% record.
The League One side will now be seeded in Sunday's last 16 draw.
Alloa had already knocked holders Ross County out of the competition prior to kick off and this was another deserved win against higher league opponents. Jack Ross' men join Partick Thistle and Rangers as the only teams to win all four of their group matches
It was a battle between two new look sides as Rovers manager Gary Locke started five players he has brought in since replacing Ray McKinnon as manager in the summer.
Alloa Athletic counterpart Ross topped that by fielding eight of his additions to the squad after relegation to League One at the end of last season.
Despite those extensive changes it was the Wasps that carried more of a sting going forward, showing pace and variety down the flanks with Spence a hard working focal point up front.
The striker, who played in Raith's Challenge Cup final winning team against Rangers in 2014, did his old club no favours when he broke the deadlock in 34 minutes, exposing Jean-Yves M'Voto's lack of pace.
Jon Robertson slid the ball in behind the former Barnsley defender and Spence sprinted clear to blast the ball into the back of the net.
It took a desperate Kyle Benedictus tackle to prevent Iain Flannigan scoring a carbon copy goal just a few minutes later, while Rovers rarely caused Alloa goalkeeper Neil Parry any problems in the first half.
Hearts legend Rudi Skacel made his Raith debut in the second half after an impromtu striptease in the technical area due to a colour clash between his cycle shorts and the club's shorts.
Not that the 37-year-old striker was able to influence the outcome of the game as he was obviously short of match sharpness and got little service anyway.
The main reason for that was the hard work and organisation of an Alloa side who defended effectively with wily old Jim Goodwin controlling things from just in front of the back four.
The vast majority of the second half was played in the visitors half but Parry was so well protected that he did not have a serious save to make for all the Kirkcaldy club's possession.
