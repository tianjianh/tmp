Officers are carrying out searches between the Stuarts' home and Tilbury, Essex, where suspect Ali Qazimaj lived.
Officers previously said there was "very little hope" Mrs Stuart would be found alive. It has now been more than two weeks since she was last seen.
Det Ch Supt Simon Parkes said: "While search officers in Suffolk, Norfolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire have been working together in the UK, we're also continuing to work with international law enforcement on the hunt for Ali Qazimaj,"
Mr Qazimaj, a Kosovan immigrant, went on the run around 24 hours after Mr Stuart's body was discovered.
The 42-year-old, who goes by the name Marco Costa, caught a ferry from Dover to Calais, at around 18:30 on 4 June. He was unaccompanied on the journey.
Mr Parkes said: "He is a suspect in a murder investigation in which someone was repeatedly stabbed - we have to assume he may be dangerous. We have no way of knowing if he is armed."
Mr and Mrs Stuart were captured on CCTV walking into Goodies Farm Shop in Wood Lane in Pulham Market, at around 10:20 on 29 May.
