The cold, wet summer weather has taken the fizz out of sales at Irn-Bru maker AG Barr.

Sales for the past six months, down 5% on the same period in 2014, at Â£128m, were also depressed by tough price competition in the soft drinks market.
The Cumbernauld-based firm is no longer selling the Orangina Brand and Finlays water. Stripping out those brands means there was a decline of 3.5%.
AG Barr said it hoped to regain momentum in the second half.
In a update issued to the stock exchange, the company said trading had "remained subdued as anticipated".
The share price fell 4% on the news.
The firm, which also makes Tizer and Rubicon, said its performance compared to a period last year when it was buoyed by its sponsorship of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
It said this "along with poor weather, particularly in the north of the UK", had hit sales while a switch-over in IT systems had produced "short term customer service challenges which have also impacted our overall revenue performance".
Barr added: "Market conditions have remained competitive with ongoing deflation across the soft drinks market and continued high levels of price promotion.
"Despite these challenges our margins remain in line with management expectations."
In recent months, it has closed its site in south Wales, started new packaging lines at its new Milton Keynes plant and acquired the Funkin cocktail drinks business.
The statement went on: "Our objective for the second half of the year is to bring improved operational stability and growth to the business and to begin to realise the benefits associated with the changes we have made."
After a disappointing first half of the year, AG Barr said it expected its sales and profit targets to be made up in second half.
The group will publish half-year results on 22 September.
