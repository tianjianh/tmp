The Gunners had two penalty claims denied and had chances to win the game through Theo Walcott and Danny Welbeck.
Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic made a string of saves, most notably touching Joel Campbell's free-kick on to a post.
The Tigers created little, but defended admirably to frustrate Arsene Wenger in his 100th FA Cup game as Arsenal boss.
The two sides made a total of 19 changes between them from their previous games - nine for Arsenal and 10 for Hull.
But Steve Bruce's Tigers not only ended a 14-game winning run in the FA Cup for the Gunners, they also prevented a repeat of their defeats by the Londoners in the 2014 final and last season's third round.
Relive Arsenal's draw with Hull

Arsenal's priorities undoubtedly lie elsewhere, with Wenger's side only two points off the top of the Premier League and a visit of Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie coming up on Tuesday.
Europe is particularly pressing for the Gunners, who have failed to go past the last 16 in any of the past five seasons, which meant there was no place for key man Mesut Ozil in the squad, while Olivier Giroud and Alexis Sanchez were restricted to contributions from the bench.
Despite the team bearing little resemblance to the XI that started in the 2-1 win over Leicester City last week, the Gunners were good enough to control the game from start to finish and created enough chances to have secured a comfortable victory.
However, the draw means Arsenal are still in with a chance of becoming the first team to win three consecutive FA Cups since Blackburn Rovers accomplished the feat 130 years ago.
It is not only Arsenal who have distractions away from the FA Cup this term, as Hull continue their bid to return to the Premier League after last season's relegation.
Only Curtis Davies remained in the side from last week's draw with Brighton, and the former Aston Villa defender blocked, headed and tracked runners enthusiastically alongside Alex Bruce and Harry Maguire in a defensive three.
Hull boss Bruce could be forgiven for the pragmatism in his team selection, as his men are in the midst of a run of 10 games in 35 days, which will now become even more congested thanks to the replay.
And while his team's resilience with have pleased the former Birmingham City manager, he will also have been delighted by the performance of 16-year-old Josh Tymon, who looked confident and composed at left full-back.
Arsenal's only issue came in front of goal, as they moved the ball around with precision to carve out 24 shots - 11 on target - compared to the six shots mustered by Hull.
But they could not find a way past Jakupovic, who allowed himself a self-congratulatory moment after taking time out to watch a replay of one of his saves on the big screen at the Emirates.
January signing Elneny, making only his second start for the Gunners, put in a standout performance for the home side.
The Egypt international was always available for the ball in midfield and dictated the pace for Arsenal from the middle of the park.
And there were promising signs from 19-year-old Nigerian Iwobi, who found plenty of space behind striker Theo Walcott to attempt through balls into a congested Hull penalty area, only for the hosts to draw a blank every time.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger: "The replay is not especially good news but Hull defended very well.
"We were not incisive or accurate enough in our passing in the final third. As long as they did not concede, they maintained with how they played. We had 20 shots, 70% possession, but no goals.
"I cannot influence the referee's decisions, only the technical quality of my team. If we have no injuries, we can cope with the fixtures.
"I think FA Cup replays is a particularity of the English rules and you have to respect that."

Hull manager Steve Bruce: "I don't know when we're going to play the replay. That's added to the fixture pile-up we've got.
"We made 10 changes and we rode our luck a bit, but the team deserved it for the spirit and the 100% effort they gave.
"It bodes well when I see the strength in depth we've got, because we're going to need it.
"Josh Tymon didn't look out of his depth and it's great to see someone from the academy, from Hull, come in and wear the shirt."
Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic: "My little daughter, my father, everybody is here. We knew it would be a difficult game and would be defend all game. We got a 0-0 and I hope the replay will be the same."
Arsenal have the small matter of the visit of five-time European champions Barcelona on Tuesday, for the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
Hull go to Ipswich on Tuesday and then host Sheffield Wednesday on Friday in the Championship.
