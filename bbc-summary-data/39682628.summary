Bristol Rovers 3-4 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shaun Hutchinson headed an 85th-minute winner as Millwall grabbed the final play-off place in League One with a thrilling win at Bristol Rovers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The big defender, wearing a dressing on a head wound and a shirt with no number, rose high above the Rovers defence to glance home Shane Ferguson's right-wing corner and send 1,200 travelling fans into party mood.
Millwall looked to have blown their chance when Billy Bodin made it 3-3 with a superb 30-yard free kick on 74 minutes.
An action-packed first half saw the visitors take a fifth-minute lead when Lee Gregory hooked in a close-range volley after a left-wing corner had been headed down.
Millwall doubled their advantage 20 minutes later, Steve Morrison heading on another corner for skipper Tony Craig to tap home from only a yard out.
Rovers hit back when Jermaine Easter rifled home on 33 minutes after Bodin's deflected shot came back off the inside of a post, but two minutes later the impressive Morrison produced a perfect cross from the right for Gregory to bundle in his second.
A right-footed rocket from Chris Lines after more good work from Bodin brought Rovers back to within a goal of the visitors on 42 minutes before the late drama.
