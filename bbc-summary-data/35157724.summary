The 34-year-old batsman has confirmed that the two-Test series against Australia in February will be his last.
McCullum is second on the Kiwi's all-time Test run scorers, with 6,273 runs from 99 matches, including 11 hundreds.
"I've loved my opportunity to play for, and captain the Black Caps. But all good things have to come to an end, and I'm just grateful for the wonderful experience," he said.
Kane Williamson will captain New Zealand at the World Twenty20 in India, which starts on 8 March.
McCullum, who made his Test debut in 2004 against South Africa and became captain in all formats in 2013, will become the first man to play 100 successive Tests from debut when he leads the Black Caps in the first Test against Australia in Wellington on 12 February.
The former wicketkeeper has been crucial to the Black Caps' run of seven Tests unbeaten until a recent defeat in Australia, becoming the first New Zealander to score a triple century when he reached 302 against India in February 2014.
He also led the Kiwis to their first Cricket World Cup final earlier this year, where they also lost to Australia.
The right-hander scored 5,909 runs in 254 one-day internationals with five hundreds and 31 fifties, and is the only player with two international hundreds in Twenty20 cricket.
