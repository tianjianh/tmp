The 34-year-old won the most recent of his 55 England caps against Chile in November 2013.
Uncapped Southampton duo Nathan Redmond and James Ward-Prowse are also selected, as is 19-year-old Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford.
Gareth Southgate's side face Germany away in a friendly on 22 March before a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on 26 March.
Captain Wayne Rooney is absent as he recovers from a leg injury, while Tottenham striker Harry Kane is missing after injuring his ankle against Millwall on Sunday.
West Brom midfielder Jake Livermore, who made his sole international appearance against Italy in 2012, returns to the squad.
Burnley defender Michael Keane and West Ham winger Michail Antonio - both of whom are uncapped - are also selected.
Southgate has also called up Manchester United left-back Luke Shaw, who has made two appearances since December, and Everton midfielder Ross Barkley.

Defoe has scored 19 times for England since making his debut against Sweden in 2004, and has 14 Premier League goals this season, the second most by any English player behind Kane (19).
"You can have the young players who are hungry and the old players who are hungry as well," Southgate told the England website.
"I think we can't just look at young players all the time. I think we have to get results now and also plan for the future."
Southgate said there was "a chance" Rooney would be fit for Manchester United's Premier League game against Middlesbrough on Sunday.
"The injury, coupled with the fact he's not really had a lot of game time recently and others have, has sort of determined my decision on that one," said Southgate.
He added: "There are some very good players and it's a battle to get in this squad.
"Wayne totally understands that. He's the most realistic senior player I think I've dealt with in terms of how he views the game.
"He doesn't have any expectations of being treated differently or treated in a special way."
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is also absent through injury, while Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has not been selected.
"I've got to say [Walcott] wasn't chuffed to bits to get the call this morning and I understand that," said Southgate.
"Quite rightly, he said: 'I'm one of the leading goalscorers in the league.' I don't mind being challenged on that at all. I totally respect that. I don't expect him to be happy.
"But I've got to make decisions and I think it was the right think to call him to talk that through, even though the timing probably wasn't great.
"He's a player I still like. I've said to him I'm not ruling out, but in terms of just having him as a squad player, I think it's a better opportunity for me to look at one or two others and see what they can do."

Harry Redknapp, who managed Defoe at Tottenham, believes the forward will believe he has a chance of playing at the 2018 World Cup.
Redknapp told BBC Radio 5 live: "Jermain is a fantastic professional and good to have around the place. I'm sure he'll be a big influence on the younger players.
"He really does take care of himself and spends time on the training ground when everyone else is finished.
"He's never short of confidence and he'll be eyeing the next tournament with relish. He will feel he has a chance."
