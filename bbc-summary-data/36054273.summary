Revenge pornography victims as young as 11, investigation finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children as young as 11 are among more than 1,000 alleged victims of revenge porn who reported offences in the first year of the new law coming into effect, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In April 2015, it became an offence to share private sexual photographs or films without the subject's consent.
The BBC analysed Freedom of Information requests from 31 forces in England and Wales between April and December.
Online safety charities said victims were left "hugely damaged".
Revenge porn refers to the act of a partner or ex-partner purposefully distributing images or videos of a sexual nature without the other person's consent.

The new law was introduced after campaigners lobbied MPs to make it a criminal offence.
Previously, convictions for this type of offence were sought under existing copyright or harassment laws.
It covers images shared on and offline without the subject's permission and with the intent to cause harm. Physical distribution of images is also covered.
An NSPCC spokesman said: "It is shocking that children as young as 11 are becoming victims of revenge porn - and underlines the urgent need for action by social media sites to improve safety.
"Young people also need to be aware of the serious risks of sending explicit material or photos of themselves."
Laura Higgins, of the Revenge Porn Helpline, said being a victim was a "hugely distressing, damaging and violating experience".
She said: "The effect on victims is often pervasive and long-lasting.
"Whilst they have been the victim of a crime, often individuals internalise feelings of guilt and shame, which can negatively affect an individual's sense of self-worth and self-esteem.
"Victim-blaming attitudes only exacerbate these feelings.  Some feel so isolated and overwhelmed they consider suicide."
Ms Higgins said the new legislation was flawed because it did not ensure the anonymity of the victim; it did not cover historical cases; and it did not cover images that had been altered via Photoshop.
The English Regions data unit analysed data from police forces in England and Wales. Some 31 responded - Dorset, Hampshire and Lincolnshire denied the request on cost grounds, while responses from Avon and Somerset, Leicestershire, Bedfordshire, Cleveland, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Dyfed Powys and Gwent Police remain outstanding.
There were wide variations in the charge rate among police forces.  Nobody had so far been charged in Lancashire, Devon and Cornwall or Cumbria, for example. In the West Midlands, 25% of reported offences resulted in a charge, while in Staffordshire, the rate dropped to 3%.
Simon Kempton, the lead on cyber crime for the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: "While some officers have had training in the new legislation across the board, there have been some inconsistencies, and there may be some officers who are yet to be given a full awareness and understanding of the new offence."
Mr Kempton said the federation welcomed the new legislation.
"Any sexual offences, including revenge porn, can have a devastating effect on victims. Until the new offence was enacted, police officers were often unable to show a criminal offence had taken place," he said.
A petition urging a change in the law to give victims the right to anonymity has been launched by the Police and Crime Commissioner for North Yorkshire, Julia Mulligan, and a revenge-porn victim.
Media outlets routinely withhold the names of victims.
Dr Emma Short, the director of the National Centre for Cyber-Stalking at the University of Bedfordshire, is conducting a survey into the effect revenge porn has on its victims.
She said: "The number of young people affected is an area for great concern, but the figures probably only represent the tip of the iceberg.
"Sending 'nudes' in dating or pre-dating relationships has become something of a norm for young people aged 18 and under."
The Crown Prosecution Service was contacted for a comment, but has not yet responded.
