Sgt Jon King, from Staffordshire Police, lost his right eye after being shot with a rubber bullet in October while helping ambulance staff deal with an aggressive patient.
Sgt King, 48, said surgeons have done a "fantastic job" with the finished eye.
A 34-year-old man was detained under the Mental Health Act following the incident in Rugeley.
Sgt King, who has retained the sight in his left eye, underwent surgery on Thursday to fit the new eye, designed to match more closely his right one.
He said the replacement feels "a little bit sore" but he has been told it will "bed in".
"It moves - I just can't see out of it," he said.
Sgt King had a temporary prosthetic replacement fitted in February, to test if his body would reject it.
He said he does not plan to return to front line policing and will be talking to Staffordshire Police about medical retirement.
"I just want to go to something easy - something where I don't get shot at," he said.
He has served with the force for 26 years.
Chief Constable Jane Sawyers said: "Sgt King's determination and courage, together with lack of self-pity, is truly inspirational."
