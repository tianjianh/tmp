[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men jailed over their part in the £25m Hatton Garden raid have failed in their appeal bid.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Wood, William Lincoln and Hugh Doyle wanted the Court of Appeal to reconsider their convictions.
But on Wednesday, three judges ruled the men had no realistic chance of winning their appeals.
The gang breached the vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in London in April 2015, stealing items initially thought were worth £14m ($20m).
That estimate was recently revised to £25m ($30m).
In total seven men were jailed.
Wood, 59, and Lincoln, 61, were found guilty of conspiring to burgle and conspiring to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property. Wood was given a six-year jail term and Lincoln was sentenced to seven years.
Doyle, 49, was found guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property and was given a 21-month jail term suspended for two years.
