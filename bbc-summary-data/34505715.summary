Edinburgh Airport has reported its busiest September ever, with more than one million passengers.

It reported passenger growth of 8.7% on the same period in 2014, after 1,073,541 people used the airport last month.
Meanwhile, Glasgow Airport experienced its busiest September for a decade, with almost 900,000 passengers.
The figure represents a 14.5% rise in passenger numbers compared with the same month last year.
Domestic growth of 10.7% at Edinburgh was attributed to more people travelling to London City and Stansted, while a 7.2% rise in international traffic was due to the popularity of Ryanair flights to Dublin and its wider route network.
The airport also reported more passengers on Norwegian Air flights to Malaga, and on SAS services, particularly to Stockholm, as well as on Etihad's route to Abu Dhabi.
Gordon Dewar, Edinburgh Airport chief executive, said: "It's fantastic to see our new routes are working well for our passengers - with over one million passengers through the doors at Edinburgh Airport last month and in every one of the last five months.
"This success is thanks particularly to the increased services from Flybe to London City and the recently launched Etihad service to Abu Dhabi.
"We've listened to our passengers for domestic connectivity and start an Edinburgh to Liverpool service with Flybe at the end of the month. We're also launching Stuttgart with EasyJet in early November.
"It's great that we can continue to announce new routes and services throughout the winter months."
At Glasgow, the number of international travellers rose by 16% on the same period in 2014, and domestic travellers grew by 12.3%.
Major sporting events including the Davis Cup and the Scotland v Germany Euro 2016 qualifying match were reported to have contributed to international growth.
Amanda McMillan, managing director of the airport, said: "September was an extremely positive month, both in terms of passenger growth and for new routes.
"With Air Canada Rouge announcing a new service to Toronto, and Air Transat announcing a brand new route to Montreal from next summer, we are continuing to strengthen our long haul connectivity.
"In terms of European routes, we will welcome another new airline, Blue Air, to the airport on 17 December with a service to Bucharest, and we received further welcome news in September that Wizz Air will also serve the Romanian capital from 2016."
