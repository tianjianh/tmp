Tunisia holiday booked - what are your options now?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Holidaymakers who have booked package deals to Tunisia are being offered breaks to the Balearics, mainland Spain and Cyprus instead.

Tour operators are bringing home UK tourists in Tunisia following a Foreign Office warning that another terror attack is "highly likely".
Thousands of UK tourists booked to travel on summer package deals are being given an alternative or a refund.
The financial impact for independent travellers could be more complex.
So what does the change in Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice mean for your summer getaway?
The FCO now advises against all but essential travel to Tunisia owing to the risk of a further terrorist attack after a gunman killed 38 holidaymakers, including 30 Britons, in the 26 June beach attack near Sousse.
This has prompted tour operators to start bringing more than 3,000 holidaymakers back to the UK, and about 500 independent travellers have also been advised to return.
Although this travel advice could be changed at any time, many tour operators have cancelled flights and holidays to Tunisia for the summer season.
For the most part, those with package deals can go to another destination, or get their money back.
Most of those who are travelling back early will get a refund for the holiday days lost.
Customers should get in touch with their tour operator, travel agent or possibly their airline.
Those travelling in the next 48 hours are being given priority. Travel association Abta suggests that anyone with bookings beyond the summer should wait until closer to their departure date before getting in touch.
The biggest operators - such as Thomson - are allowing people to choose from any destinations "currently on sale".
Clearly, the biggest operators will have more choice of destination. Holidaymakers should be given a decent choice, rather than a "take it or leave it option".
In the rules of Abta-registered package deals is a right to an alternative holiday or a full refund - the customer can choose between the two.
This is where things get a little more complicated.
Airlines will generally reschedule flights, allowing people to travel at a different time or to a different destination.
Cancellation fees may apply for accommodation or car hire. To get that money back, a claim on travel insurance may be needed. Some travel insurance policies, but not all, will cover the cost of cancellation.
Many of those who only bought flights and are in Tunisia now are being helped by tour operators, but others should contact their airline.
It is in the small print, but the insurer will be able to tell you.
First of all, you would need to have bought the travel insurance before the advice from the FCO changed to advise against all but essential travel.
Some insurers would have required policyholders to pay a bit more for travel disruption cover.
Q&A for holidaymakers from Abta
Foreign Office advice for travel to Tunisia
No, no additional compensation is paid to package holiday customers.
Thomson and First Choice are giving a Â£50 discount to some customers who take new flights to some alternative destinations.
Those who are there are being strongly advised to return.
Those who want to go should be looking at the FCO advice to find out when it might be safe again to travel.
While the current FCO warning is in place, most travel insurance policies will be invalid for those who plan to travel anyway.
