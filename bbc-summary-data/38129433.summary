Wycombe Wanderers striker Adebayo Akinfenwa reported an incident to the referee after a match against Cambridge United on 19 November.
The Football Association confirmed it was investigating, as did Cambridge United and the police.
It has now emerged a Cambridge fan has been banned by the club.
Akinfenwa, 34, reported the incident to referee Trevor Kettle, who included it in his match report.

The FA contacted both Akinfenwa and Cambridge United for their observations of events during the League Two match earlier this month, and both clubs confirmed they would take "appropriate action" against those involved.
