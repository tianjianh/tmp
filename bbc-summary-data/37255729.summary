University and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) statistics revealed 19,320 Welsh students have had their applications accepted as of 1 September - 14 days after A-level results.
Of those, 10,920 are due to study in Wales and 8,260 in England.
This is up from 17,790 who entered higher education at the same point in 2012.
According to Ucas, 140 Welsh students are set to attend university in Scotland while just 10 will study in Northern Ireland.
Figures also showed 1,310 Welsh students had won a place through clearing.
A breakdown across the UK shows a 15% rise in English students being accepted into higher education in the past four years along with a 19% increase in Scottish students and a 14% rise in Northern Irish students.
In total, 498,270 students across the UK have been accepted into universities so far.
There are still places available at universities across Wales via clearing - although Cardiff University said on its website that vacancies for 2016 have been filled.
Olivia Jones, of Universities Wales, said it was encouraging that the majority of Welsh students have chosen to study in Wales.
"With 92% of graduates from full time first degree courses in Wales employed or in further study six months after leaving - a higher percentage than the UK average - this is an attractive offer for prospective students," she said.
"Universities across Wales are committed to increasing opportunities for people from a diverse range of backgrounds to higher education and firmly believe that every person, regardless of circumstance, should have the opportunity to access a higher level learning experience that is appropriate, relevant and valuable."
