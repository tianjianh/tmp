Torsten Kulke, 48, was reported missing on 31 July after arriving on the island a few days earlier.
A member of the public reported finding a man's body on Cliff Beach, near to the Valtos area of Lewis, at about 15:25 on Saturday.
Formal identification is yet to take place, however Mr Kulke's family have been informed.
Mr Kulke was last seen near Aird Uig at about 18:00 on Friday 28 July.
A rucksack containing personal items belonging to the 48-year-old was found a week later during searches of clifftops on the island.
There are not thought to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding Mr Kulke's death.
Police Scotland said a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.
