Local media said the woman checked her husband's mobile phone after becoming suspicious he was having an affair.
The husband complained to the police and his wife was prosecuted under a cybercrime law, Gulf News reported.
The unnamed woman - an Arab expatriate in the UAE - was fined 150,000 dirhams (Â£28,000; $41,000), the report said.
She admitted to the court that she had accessed his phone without permission and transferred photos to her device, her lawyer told Gulf News.
The lawyer, Eman Sabt, said the couple were in their 30s and of Arab origin, but gave no other information.
