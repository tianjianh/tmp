Holidaymakers have reported at least 12 people falling ill after staying at the Bay Torbay Hotel in Torquay.
The three-star hotel on the seafront, which has 111 rooms and a swimming pool, will be closed from Friday until Monday as cleaning takes place.
Residents said the "horrendous" experience "ruined their Easter break".
A small number of bays have been closed at Torbay Hospital, Paignton Community Hospital and Totnes Community Hospital after an increase in norovirus cases.
A spokesperson for the Bay Torbay Hotel said: "We have chosen to close the hotel for a short period this weekend as a precautionary measure so that we can carry out a deep clean.
"All guests who were due to arrive on Friday will be relocated to a sister hotel close by, and the Bay Torbay Hotel will be reopen as usual from Monday onwards."
Torbay hospital says it has seen an increase of norovirus cases in the community.
A Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust spokesperson, said: "We can confirm that as a result, a very small number of our hospital wards are currently affected by either flu or norovirus.
"In addition, some of our community hospitals have restrictions in place regarding discharges, admissions and visiting because of norovirus.
"Staff in clinical areas, our infection control team and cleaning team are working to deal with the outbreak."
The trust has asked for visitors to help restrict the outbreak by washing their hands, using a tissue when sneezing or coughing, and using soap and warm water rather than special hand-gels, particularly after using the toilet and before eating and drinking anything.
