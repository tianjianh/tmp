People will be able to travel between Stratford and Stanmore throughout the night on Friday and Saturdays, with one train every 10 minutes.
In addition, London Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced the Northern Line will run through the night from 18 November.
An all-night service began on the Central and Victoria lines in August, with nearly 750,000 journey having been made.
Northern Line services will run from High Barnet and Edgware, via the Charing Cross branch, to Morden. The Night Tube services run from 00:30 and 05:00 BST.
The Piccadilly Line will join the Night Tube service later this year once drivers have completed training.
Mr Khan said the ambition was to have a Night Tube service on all lines.
He added: "There was a real buzz from when we launched the first Night Tube services in August, and I am delighted that the Jubilee Line services are now up and running.
"Hundreds of thousands of Londoners have already benefited, and it's  great news that so many more will now be able to enjoy our world-class cultural venues on the South Bank, as well as venues such as The O2 and Wembley Stadium, without needing to make that late dash for the last Tube.
"Being from Tooting, I'm also really looking forward to the start of services on the Northern line next month."

After all those false dawns, strikes and a year of delays, nothing now seems to be stopping the roll out of the Night Tube.
I've got some figures from London Underground (LU) that give some insight into how the Night Tube is being used. On the Victoria and Central lines, after an initial surge, usage dipped but it has since picked up again:
LU said this was much higher than its predictions but it was confident it would pay for itself within three years.
And LU said it had noticed two peaks. Revellers at 01:30 BST and workers at 04:00.
The Night Tube in figures
Alan Bishop, Southbank Centre chief executive, said: "We are so pleased to welcome the introduction of the Night Tube to the Jubilee line, which will enable Londoners from all corners of the city to enjoy the cultural offerings of Southbank Centre and our neighbours."
Simon Pitkeathley, chief executive of Camden Town Unlimited, said: "Camden Town has some of London's most iconic music venues, traditional pubs, and fantastic restaurants.
"It stands out as a shining star in London's night-time economy. We're absolutely delighted that the Night Tube on the Northern Line will reflect this."
