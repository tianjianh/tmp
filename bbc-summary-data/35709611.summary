Phil Taylor produced another excellent display to thrash Adrian Lewis 7-1 in the Premier League, as Michael van Gerwen went top of the table.

Taylor, 55, eased past fellow Stoke-on-Trent thrower Lewis in Exeter to earn his fourth successive victory.
Van Gerwen, who hit a record televised average of 123.40 seven days earlier, registered 116.67 as he sent Peter Wright to his first defeat.
Gary Anderson, James Wade and Michael Smith were also winners in round five.
