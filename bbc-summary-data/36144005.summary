Rock bands and choirs will take part in the shows, with locations including the iconic Tees Transporter Bridge.
Other events on the day include the Ulster Orchestra performing in the grounds of the Stormont Parliament Buildings in Belfast.
In Bristol, a children's "vegetable orchestra" will be led by Shaun The Sheep at Colston Hall.
Duran Duran have already been announced as the headliners at a special concert in Cornwall's Eden Project, with Laura Mvula now confirmed as the support act.
BBC Radio 2 will broadcast the concert live, while highlights will be shown on BBC One on Sunday, 5 June.
In Scotland, Travis will play a one-off, free show with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow's Barrowlands venue.
"It's the coolest thing we've been asked to do," singer Fran Healy said. "The fact the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra will join us on our turf at the Barrowlands - and not in their usual habitat - is something I feel the audience will love."
A UK-wide bell-ringing event is also planned for 19:00 BST on BBC Music Day, with more than 50 church towers ringing simultaneously, including Bristol and Manchester cathedral and smaller parish churches like Saint Francis Xaviers in Liverpool and St Mary's at Turville in Buckinghamshire.
BBC Wales will host a dawn performance by choristers Only Men Aloud, premiering a new song composed by Amy Wadge, co-writer of Ed Sheeran's Grammy-winning song Thinking Out Loud.
And CBBC is asking its young audience to submit recordings of the Danger Mouse theme tune, which will be stitched together to create a crowd-sourced version of the song.
Full details of events around the UK can be found on the BBC Press Website.
BBC Music Day launched last year, billed as a "UK-wide celebration of sound".
Events included a day-long musical relay along the length of Hadrian's Wall, and Manic Street Preachers performing to 10,000 people at Cardiff Castle.
A world record for the longest distance between singers of a duet was also set - as classical musician Shan Cothi in Cardiff sang the Welsh hymn Calon Lan with Andres Evans, a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia - 12,120 kilometres away.
