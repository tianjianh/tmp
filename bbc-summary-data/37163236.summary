Patrick Hickey is being held at Bangu 10 Prison over his alleged role in a scheme to sell Olympic tickets for more than their face value.
It was reported that when police arrived at his hotel room Mr Hickey's wife said he had gone home to Ireland.
He was later found in another room in the same hotel.
In a statement, Mr Hickey's lawyer said: "Mr Hickey did not try to escape as informed by police.
"He was sleeping already for two days in one of the three rooms that were allocated to him and his family, due to insomnia, and he did not want to disturb his wife."
His lawyer said claims he tried to escape were "ridiculous" and said his wife had merely "panicked" when faced with Brazillian police.
Mr Hickey denies the allegations against him but has stepped down from all his posts temporarily.
It is thought he will appear in court later this week.
On Sunday, three other senior Olympic Council of Ireland officials, including one from Northern Ireland, had their passports, phones and laptops seized in Brazil.
The OCI has appointed a crisis management committee to lead its response to Brazil.
