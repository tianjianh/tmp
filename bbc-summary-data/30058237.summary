Slough council has agreed to shut the road over the railway at Stoke Poges Lane from 24 November until April, with some of the main work due at Christmas.
In a letter to residents Network Rail said the Horlicks bridge works would carry on through Christmas Day and include the sound of chainsaws.
The renovations form part of the Â£14.8bn Crossrail project.
Using existing tracks, new 200m (650ft) trains, able to take up to 1,500 passengers, will run from Reading to London Paddington.
Work on the wider scheme started in May 2009 but its extension to Reading was announced in April.
The letter sent to locals said: "The removal of the bridge will generate noise throughout the Christmas period beginning on Christmas Eve with the preparation of the tracks, and continuing both day and night until 28 December.
"There will also be occasional night works including chainsaws for vegetation clearance, planning tarmac off the bridge and removing the existing bridge parapets.
"We will do our best to minimise the impact of our work on local residents."
The existing bridge will be cut up and removed in late December, with construction on its replacement beginning on 5 January.
A road closure will be in place between Lansdowne Avenue and the Horlicks Factory at Simpson Way, but access to both roads will remain for residents.
The first Crossrail services through central London will start in late 2018.
