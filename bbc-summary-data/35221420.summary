The 32-year-old left the Addicks in the summer and recently had a spell with Indian Premier League side Pune City.
"He's obviously a player who knows the club and, importantly, knows the league," interim head coach Karel Fraeye told the club website.
"He did the job last season, he brings a big voice on the pitch and he will bring us the experience we need."
Former Cardiff, Birmingham and Wolves centre-back Johnson joined Charlton last February on a short-term deal and made 14 appearances for the south-east London club last season.
He becomes Charlton's second signing of the transfer window, following the arrival of Rhys Williams on loan from Middlesbrough.
