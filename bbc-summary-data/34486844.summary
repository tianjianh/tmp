Dan Davies won the Gordon Burn Prize for his book, In Plain Sight: The Life and Lies of Jimmy Savile.
Actress - and judge - Maxine Peake described it as "compelling".
"This is so much more than a book about the monster that is Savile. It's about grotesque social attitudes towards the famous and money," she said.
The winner was picked from a selected shortlist by a judging panel comprising of Peake, authors Roddy Doyle and Doug Johnstone, artist Gavin Turk and journalist Suzanne Moore.
'Clear-eyed examination'
Davies' book details Savile's secretive life and the author's own developing relationship with the TV presenter over the course of multiple interviews, as well as examining the many inquiries which have followed the discovery that Savile was one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators.
Originally turned down by a slew of publishers prior to Savile's death, because it was deemed too controversial, it was published to critical acclaim last year.
Johnstone, author of The Jump, called it "a clear-eyed examination of a terrifying personality".
"Dan Davies has dug deep to produce one of the finest examples of investigative journalism I've ever read."
The Gordon Burn Prize was set up in 2012 to honour the late journalist whose extensive books covered topics such as the Yorkshire Ripper, Fred and Rosemary West and the Moors murderers.
According to organisers, which include publishers Faber & Faber (one of those who originally turned down Davies' book), the Gordon Burn Trust and New Writing North, the award seeks "to illuminate the work of those writers whose work follows in his [Burn's] bold footsteps".
Davies receives Â£5,000 and the offer of a writing retreat for three months.
