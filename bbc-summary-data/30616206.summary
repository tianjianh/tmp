[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ice warning still in place for whole of Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A warning to drivers to be wary of icy roads was in force across the whole of Wales after temperatures dipped to below freezing.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office issued the yellow "be aware" weather warning following the sharp drop in the early hours of Sunday, and snowfall on Friday.
Widespread icy patches were expected on untreated roads.
The weather saw Wrexham FC's game against Forest Green postponed because of a frozen pitch.
The warning expired at midday, and although temperatures were expected to remain just a few degrees above freezing most of Wales was forecast clear skies and sunshine.
