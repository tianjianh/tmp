Dean Brill is relishing his battle with Craig Samson for the goalkeeper's jersey at Motherwell after moving from Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

The 30-year-old Englishman was released after playing only once in 18 months following an April 2015 knee injury.
But he signed a one-year contract with their Scottish Premiership rivals.
"As long as I get a good crack of the whip, and Craig will probably say the same, I'm happy and I back myself to fight for that jersey," said Brill.
Samson himself has had to be patient for his chance, the 32-year-old Scot having been second-choice behind on-loan Middlesbrough goalkeeper Connor Ripley for most of the season after switching from Kilmarnock last summer.
"We are both experienced enough," said Brill. "We have both been in the game and possibly in this situation before. I certainly have.
"And it's one I'm looking forward to and relishing. He is a good guy as well as a good goalkeeper, but I want to be playing and, come the start of the season, that's where I hope to be."
Brill was unable to win his place back from Owain Fon Williams at Caley Thistle after his return from injury - the Welshman's form also securing a spot in his country's squad at the Euro 2016 finals.
"It was a big operation," said the former Luton Town, Oldham Athletic and Barnet goalkeeper who joined Caley Thistle in 2013.
"But I was lucky enough to have the best surgeon in the UK, which I'm grateful to Inverness for.
"I will always be grateful to them for looking after me.
"But I have been in full training since the end of March and played five or six games for the Inverness Under-20s, so I feel I have fully come through it."
