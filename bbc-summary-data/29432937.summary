Paul McGuigan, 37, and Australian Darren Hoare were shot dead by former paratrooper Danny Fitzsimons in 2009.
An inquest into Mr McGuigan's death heard he told his fiancÃ©e Fitzsimons was "weird" during a Skype call.
Fitzsimons, from Rochdale, is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Baghdad.

He had admitted killing Mr McGuigan, originally from Peebles, Scotland, and Darren Hoare in August 2009.

His mother Corinne Boyd-Russell told the inquest that when she last saw her son he had been excited that his fiancÃ©e Nicola Prestage expecting a baby.
All three men had been working for British security firm ArmorGroup, part of G4S, based in the Iraqi capital's fortified Green Zone.
