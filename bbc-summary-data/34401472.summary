[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rural teaching shortage is 'age-old' problem

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The challenges facing some councils in the north of Scotland recruiting teachers touch on several issues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
One is a challenge faced by many employers in rural and remote areas - finding suitably-qualified applicants for skilled, professional jobs.
The bulk of people from rural areas who become teachers leave home aged around 18 to begin their studies. Inevitably many might not want to return, at least while they are in their 20s.
The problem here is age-old. Some call it rural depopulation, others the brain drain.
Luring people back is easier said than done. Advertising the benefits or attractions of an area can help. So might practical schemes like subsidised housing for people settling there.
Alternatively, can people - especially graduates who are settled in an area - be persuaded to train to become teachers with a view to filling vacancies in their area? For instance, might graduates who already work for a council be supported through teacher training?
But is the problem with teacher vacancies a local problem or a national one?
It is a local one in so far as it is confined to particular areas. Unions and the Scottish government insist there is no problem with the number of places in teacher training in Scotland, or with the overall number of people who are qualified as teachers.
By implication, there are qualified teachers in Scotland who prefer the thought of supply work or temporary posts in an urban area to a permanent job in a remote location.
It is also important to distinguish between any planned reduction in teacher numbers and practical difficulties filling posts. The current funding deal between councils and the Scottish government means councils have to try to maintain the number of teaching posts at current levels.
So could some sort of national workforce planning help? Probationary teachers are paid more if they offer to work for any council in Scotland rather than specify where they want to go.
Aberdeen and parts of neighbouring Aberdeenshire seem to suffer a different problem - the cost of living. One potential solution could involve looking at "north-east weighting" in salaries although a way would need to be found to do this without moving away from nationally-agreed terms and conditions of employment.
A final point concerns just who can become a teacher in Scotland.
There has been some debate over the fact that the minority of teachers in England who effectively learned on the job as graduate trainees, and who did not go on to obtain the equivalent of a Postgraduate Diploma in Education, cannot register to teach in Scotland.
However, the majority of teachers from England do meet the standards of the General Teaching Council (GTC) for Scotland - typically 300-400 teachers a year from England register with it, so can apply for vacancies in Scotland.
Naturally, the vast majority of teachers in Scotland who did not qualify here come from other parts of the UK.
The GTC is currently consulting on whether to change the requirements for registration.
But it insists any changes would not be made to find a stop-gap solution in a particular area - while unions would fight any move to allow people they would see as "unqualified" being allowed to teach in Scottish state schools.
