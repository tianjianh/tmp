[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair were able to escape before Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service arrived.
The incident happened on the A483 near Clyro, Powys, shortly after 16:00 BST on Tuesday.
It follows the yellow severe weather warning which was issued by the Met Office for Tuesday.
The Met Office warned gusts of up to 60mph could hit parts of Wales and southern England as strong south-westerly winds sweep across the country.
It warned of tricky conditions for drivers of towing vehicles.
A spokesman said it was "a little bit unusual" to get winds of this severity in the southern part of the UK at this time of year.
The warning was in force until 19:00.
