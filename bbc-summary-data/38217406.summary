The U's took control of the second-round replay when Ryan Taylor found the corner of the net with a low effort.
Alex MacDonald hit the bar with a free-kick for the hosts, and the already under pressure Silkmen then had Mitch Hancox sent off for two cautions.
Shots by Joe Rothwell and Kane Hemmings sealed victory after the break.
Rothwell slotted in his first senior goal and Taylor teed up Hemmings for the 77th-minute goal which clinched a third-round tie away against Championship strugglers Rotherham United.
