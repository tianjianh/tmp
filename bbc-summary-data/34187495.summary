[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £1m library has opened in Stafford despite nearly 3,000 people signing a petition against the plans.

The facility in Stafford Place will stock more than one million books and includes access to 3D printing.
Labour councillors disapproved of the new library, which has been relocated from Shire Hall, because it is not in the town centre.
Staffordshire County Council said it could be "used flexibly to meet the changing needs of local communities".
An Innovation Suite at the library features technology for local businesses, community groups, schools and individuals, the county council said.
Maureen Compton, a Labour councillor, said: "People are used to the Shire Hall... and the library being in the centre of town.
"It's a modern building... but people will have to get used to it because it's not going to move."
Ben Adams, Conservative cabinet member for learning and skills, said the area needed "flexible modern library spaces that suit the way people live now, and this is a perfect example".
The council launched a consultation into the future of its 43 libraries in 2014, after a drop in the number of people using them.
