The princess's christening will take place at St Mary Magdalene Church in Norfolk on 5 July.
The new coin will be available in silver and gold to mark the occasion.
Director of commemorative coin Shane Bissett said: "It is only appropriate that we commemorate this significant occasion with the release of a special coin."
The coins' design will be approved by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen and the Chancellor George Osborne.
It will then be revealed in the next couple of weeks.
A limited edition Â£5 coin was also issued by the Mint, based in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff, to mark the princess's birth on 2 May.
