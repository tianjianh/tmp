The incident occurred in the second minute of the match.
Launchbury, who went on to score two tries, could miss the remaining autumn internationals against Argentina and Australia.
If found guilty at a hearing on Monday, the Wasps captain could be banned for between four and 12 weeks.
The 25-year-old appeared to aim for the ball, but instead struck Tikoirotuma.
Launchbury has started England's last two internationals alongside Courtney Lawes in the second row.
