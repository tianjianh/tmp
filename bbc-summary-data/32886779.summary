Nico Reed, who had cerebral palsy and severe learning disabilities, was found dead at Barrantynes home in Chalgrove, Oxfordshire, in August 2012.
Oxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) confirmed it will carry out the investigation.
An inquest heard Nico may have been saved if checks were made on him more often.
Southern Health, which runs the unit, has previously said Nico's needs were met.
An inquest in December at Oxfordshire Coroner's Court heard that the 23-year-old died after inhaling his own vomit.
It was told on the night Nico died there was one member of staff caring for four profoundly disabled residents and it was likely there had been 45 minutes to an hour between the time Nico was last seen and found not breathing.
Guidelines suggested checks every 20 minutes.
After the inquest, Nico's parents Rosi and Ian Reed, from Bloxham, lobbied for an independent review into their son's death.
A blog written by his parents said an independent investigation was preferable to a serious case review as it had a "wider remit".
The family were told the investigation could take between six and 12 months.
They wrote in the blog: "What matters is that it's a far reaching, thorough investigation."
Southern Health took over the running of the unit from the now defunct Ridgeway Partnership after Nico's death in 2012.
The CCG said it will not comment while the review is taking place.
