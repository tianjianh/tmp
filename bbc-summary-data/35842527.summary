[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man jailed for the murder of a woman found dead in a horse paddock has had an appeal against his conviction dismissed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Justin Robertson, 36, was paid Â£1,500 by Benjamin Carr, 22, to kill his former stepmother Pennie Davis in September 2014, after a long-running feud between the pair.
Robertson had denied murder but was convicted after a six-week trial.
His appeal was dismissed at a hearing of the Court of Appeal in London.
Mother-of-five Mrs Davis, 47, was found dead by her new husband in a field at Leygreen Farm near Beaulieu in the New Forest, where she had been tending to her horses.
She had been stabbed 14 times in an attack described by trial judge Justice Andrew Popplewell QC as "particularly brutal".
Carr, from Southampton, was convicted of conspiracy to murder and ordered to serve a minimum of 30 years.
