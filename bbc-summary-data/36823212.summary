Cuadrado, 28, shone in Serie A and the 2014 World Cup before joining the Blues for Â£23.3m from Fiorentina in February 2015, but failed to score in 13 games.
He was loaned to Juventus last season, scoring four goals in 28 appearances to help them to the league and cup double.
"I wanted him when I was Juventus coach. He will come back very soon and train and play with us," said Conte.
"Now, he's a Chelsea player and he'll stay with us. If something changes you'll know."
The arrival of Pedro at Chelsea from Barcelona last August saw Cuadrado join Conte's former club Juventus on loan five days later.
As well as playing a significant part in Juventus' successful season, he also helped Colombia to a third-place finish at the Copa America this summer.
