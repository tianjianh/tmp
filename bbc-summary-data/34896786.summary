New Zealander Ko, 18, finished joint seventh in the season-ending CME Group Tour Championship in Naples.
South Korean Park and American Thompson missed birdie putts on the 17th which would have put them ahead of Ko in the season's standings.
American Cristie Kerr won the $500,000 tournament on 17 under par.
Ko carded a final-round level-par 72, missing a putt for birdie on the 18th and did not know she had topped the rankings until she had walked off the green.
"It was kind of a tough day. The hole is smaller than the ball today," said Ko, who in September became the youngest winner of a major by lifting the Evian Championship.
"Every emotion went through me. I'm happy that the season is over and I can relax now."
South Korea's Ha Na Jang and American Gerina Piller shared second place at the Tiburon course, one shot behind Kerr.
Thompson went round in 68 to finish fourth on 14 under, while world number two Park was sixth, two shots back.
