UWE unit named after Bristol's Princess Campbell opens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new nurse training facility named after Bristol's first black ward sister has officially opened at the University of the West of England (UWE).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The suite which includes a simulated children's ward and a sensory room is dedicated to Princess Campbell who died aged 76 in September.
Mrs Campbell campaigned against racism and inequality in the city after facing prejudice over housing and jobs.
She was appointed MBE in 2011 for services to the community.
Mrs Campbell, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, came to Bristol in 1962 and later worked at Glenside Hospital in Fishponds.
The new Children's Focused Nursing Simulation Suite is located at the Faculty of Health and Applied Sciences on the Glenside Campus of the UWE,
The facility has all the features of a real hospital setting including emergency call buttons, hospital beds and cots.
It is designed to enable student nurses to develop skills and get the chance to practise them in simulated environment.
NHS England's Kath Evans, who opened the facility, said: "We know that the experience of care can improve our patient's physical and emotional wellbeing, so it's essential that nursing students have the opportunity to develop the way they interact with the children, young people and families that they care for.
"I'm delighted to see that the University of the West of England has created this stimulation suite to help prepare our nurses of the future."
