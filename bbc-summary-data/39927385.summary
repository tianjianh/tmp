Dirk Kuyt says "everyone laughed" when he said Feyenoord could win their first Dutch title since 1999 when he returned to the club two years ago.

However, the 36-year-old captain's prediction came true on Sunday as his hat-trick saw the hosts beat Heracles Almelo 3-1 to secure the Eredivisie.
And on Monday, the former Liverpool forward led the parade as thousands of fans rejoiced in Rotterdam.
"This is the best moment of my career," said Kuyt.
He added that the title topped his appearances for Liverpool in the 2007 Champions League final and the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final.
"I knew when I came back two years ago that we could win the championship and everyone laughed at me when I said so," said Kuyt.
"When Feyenoord were in the top half of the league everyone used to celebrate. When we drew 1-1 with Ajax people were dancing on the table.
"That shouldn't happen - you should only be satisfied when you are winning trophies."
