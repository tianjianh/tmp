Police said the 25-year-old was standing next to his parked car at Linlithgow Rugby Club when he was punched and repeatedly kicked.
The attack, which involved an "acne-scarred" man with two Boxer-style dogs, happened at about 23:00 on Saturday.
Police have issued a picture of a blue Ford Focus, which was similar to the one being driven by the attacker.
They said the victim was approached by the man from behind as he stood in the car park in the town's Mains Road.
He was punched, causing him to fall to the ground, then kicked numerous times.
Following the assault, the injured man made his way to Linlithgow town centre to get help.
The suspect was described as being white, in his 40s, about 5ft 10in tall, and of stocky build. He had short, dark hair and was clean-shaven with facial acne scarring.
He was said to speak with a local accent and was wearing a dark knitted-style hooded top with fleece lining and had two Boxer style dogs, one dark-coloured and the other pure white.
Det Con Jo McCall, of Police Scotland, said: "This was an extremely violent attack that left the man seriously injured and hospitalised with significant facial injuries.
"We are now appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time and remembers seeing anything suspicious, or the victim walking injured through Linlithgow, to contact police immediately."
