Myron Issac-Yarde was found dying in Camplin Street, New Cross, on 3 April after officers were called to a row involving between six and 10 young men.
Police want witnesses who may have seen the group or a white or light-coloured car leaving the scene.
A 15-year-old boy has been charged with Myron's murder.
Four other teenagers who were arrested on suspicion of murder have been released on bail pending inquiries.
Det Ch Insp Rebecca Reeves said: "A week on from Myron's murder, detectives will be returning to the area to speak to local people.
"Witnesses have told us that some of the young men who were present during the disorder arrived or left on bicycles. Were you there? Did you see them?
"In addition, I am interested in any information concerning a white or light-coloured car that was seen travelling away from the scene shortly after the murder.
"This vehicle seems to have headed north along Camplin Street, away from New Cross Gate, but it is not clear whether this car left the area straight away."
Myron, who was also known as MDot, had performed in concerts and online videos.
