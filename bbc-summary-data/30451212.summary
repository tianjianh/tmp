Doctor Gwyn Haydn Roberts jailed for drink-drive crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has been jailed for 27 months for seriously injuring two people in a crash while over the drink-drive limit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwyn Haydn Roberts, 45, drank one-and-a-half litres of cider and two cans of Special Brew after a visit to his sick mother in Gwynedd ended in a row.
Mold Crown Court heard he drove on the wrong side of the road and went around bends on a grass verge on the A487.
Roberts, from Abergavenny, admitted causing serious injuries by dangerous driving.
He was also banned from driving for four years.
The court heard the head-on crash happened on 17 June between Penrhyndeudraeth and Maentwrog in Gwynedd when Roberts crossed a double white line and hit a car.
Two men in that car suffered broken bones, deep cuts and bruises while Roberts' sternum was broken.
Blood tests taken from Roberts four hours later showed he had 180mg of alcohol in 100ml of his blood. The legal limit is 80mg.
Judge Rhys Rowlands said the decision to try and drive more than 130 miles along "tortuous roads" was "extraordinarily dangerous".
