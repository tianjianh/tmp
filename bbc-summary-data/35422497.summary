The charity's lifeboats were launched 1,058 times and rescued 1,029 people, it said.
The Mumbles lifeboat station was the busiest while Porthcawl was the inshore lifeboat station with the highest number of launches.
Released on Wednesday, the figures were slightly down on 2014 in which crews helped 1,244 people.
