Mike Towell died in hospital on Friday night after being knocked down twice during his bout with Welsh fighter Dale Evans in Glasgow on Thursday.
The Dundee boxer's partner, Chloe Ross, put the "last picture of Rocco and his daddy" on her Facebook page.
Boxer Evans has said he is "absolutely heartbroken" by Towell's death.
"I feel like I am responsible," Evans, 24, told BBC Wales Sport. "It has been awful. All I can think of is his two-year-old kid and his girlfriend and family who won't have him around any more.
"I feel like I am responsible because we are the ones punching each other - and this is something I have to live with now."
Towell, 25, died at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital at about 23:00 on Friday with his family at his bedside.
In her Facebook post, Ms Ross thanked everyone for their messages and fundraising.
"Thank you all so so much for all the kind messages and the fundraising," she said. "I'm in shock. Everyone is so kind," "And i have loved seeing everyone's pictures of him. I cant believe how loved that boy is!!!!!!!! He will be so happy all his boxing heroes know who he is, just the wrong circumstances. The last picture of Rocco and his daddy which he sent me on Wednesday..So glad Michael has his dad up there with him ❤️❤️ xxxxxx"
A Just Giving Page was set up by former world champion boxer Ricky Hatton.
Ms Ross earlier revealed that Towell, 25, had been suffering migraines for weeks but had dismissed them as pre-match stress.
And gym owner and promoter Alex Morrison told the Scottish Sun on Sunday that the boxer had stopped a sparring session because of headaches just weeks before the fight which led to his death.
Mr Morrison said Towell was advised not to box on because "he wasn't feeling too good".
Towell's management team said it was not aware of any headache problems leading up to the fight.
Spencer Oliver, the former European Super Bantamweight champion, said Towell would not have been allowed to fight if there had been doubts about his health.
Towell, who had been undefeated going in to the fight, was knocked down in the first round of the fight at Glasgow's Radisson Blu Hotel but recovered to continue.
Referee Victor Loughlin stopped the contest in the fifth round after Towell was knocked down for a second time.
He received treatment in the ring and was given oxygen before being taken to an ambulance on a stretcher.
His died 12 hours after his life support machine was switched off.
