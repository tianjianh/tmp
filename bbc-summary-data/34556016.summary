Leanne Wood said Plaid faced a "big mountain" but it was not impossible to become Wales' biggest party.
It goes in to next year's Assembly elections as the third biggest party, behind Labour and the Tories.
Ms Wood will deliver a speech on Saturday at the SNP conference in Aberdeen, the biggest in the party's history.
"There are many things that we can learn from the SNP experience, not least the way in which they replaced the Labour government back in 2007 and have turned a lot of the problems around that were in Scotland back then," she said.
"We can learn lessons from Scotland there - where there is a strong party, a national party of government, then there can be real success and we can do the same for Wales."
