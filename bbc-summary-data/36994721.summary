[SN]TITLE[SN]
Greenock Morton 1-1 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late Luke Leahy goal rescued a point for Falkirk at Cappielow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Morton took a first-half lead through Lee Kilday, the defender profiting from a blunder from stand-in Falkirk keeper Deniz Memhmet.
Neither side was able to fashion too many clear cut chances throughout, though Craig Sibbald's header did draw a good save from Derek Gaston.
The home side looked to be heading for the win until Leahy's intervention in stoppage time ensured a draw.
Morton finished 27 points behind Falkirk in the Championship last season, but were buoyed by their League Cup victory at Hamilton Accies in midweek; their second Premiership scalp of the season having also beaten Kilmarnock earlier in the competition.
The match was in serious jeopardy ahead of kick-off for a rather unusual reason - a dodgy PA system. The tannoy was broken and safety rules dictate that a match cannot go ahead without a functioning tannoy system.
Fortunately the issue was resolved, although Falkirk's stand-in goalkeeper Deniz Dogan Mehmet may wish it had not been as it was his error that presented Morton with the opening goal.
He came for a corner, but dropped the ball straight at the feet of Kilday who smashed the ball home from close range.
Jai Quitongo scored the winner at New Douglas Park in midweek, and his pace was a constant menace to the Falkirk defence. He felt he may have had a decent penalty claim with the match still goalless, but Leahy's sliding challenge looked to be perfectly timed.
Falkirk struggled to produce the fluency they displayed so often last season, but they almost grabbed a leveller early in the second-half.
A dangerous cross into the box found Sibbald just eight yards out, but Gaston managed to palm the ball away from goal.
Morton looked reasonably comfortable in the closing stages, but were stung at the death.
Substitute Myles Hippolyte launched a long throw into the box and Leahy arrived at the right time to fire home from close range to ensure the Bairns left Greenock with their first point of the league season.
Morton manager Jim Duffy: "The players are adamant there was a handball leading up to the goal, it was a flick on from the hand.
"If that's the case then we're disappointed the official didn't see that.
"There was a slight delay in their celebration and that kind of told me they were looking to see whether anyone had spotted it or not.
"I haven't seen it back but just at the time it looked like it might have been handball and if that's the case it will be even more painful."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "Our first-half performance was woeful. The difference between the first-half and the second-half can only be down to attitude.
"Hard work hides a multitude of sins and today we were the sinners in the first-half because our performance was lacklustre and we apologise to the Falkirk fans for that.
"I'll take the second-half performance all day long."
