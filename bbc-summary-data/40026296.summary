Twenty-two people were killed and 59 injured when a man set off a bomb in the foyer at the end of a concert by Ariana Grande, on Monday.
Humberside Police said they were bringing in extra armed officers, and explosive sniffer dogs in response.
BBC Radio 1 said its focus was safety and it was working with police ahead of the festival.
Andy McDyer, Assistant Chief Constable of Humberside Police, said concertgoers would see "heightened security" at entrances and dropping-off points.
He said armed officers would be present for public protection, with airport-style security measures in place.
Police explosive sniffers dogs will also be on site, he said.
However, Mr McDyer added that the measures were a precaution and there was no intelligence to suggest the event would be targeted.
The UK terror threat level is now up to its highest level of "critical", meaning more attacks may be imminent.
In a statement, BBC Radio 1 said: "Our thoughts are with the victims and the families of those affected by the tragic events in Manchester.
"The health and safety of everyone involved in Big Weekend is now our primary focus and we are carrying out a full assessment, with the police and our partners, of every aspect of the festival."
Up to 50,000 music fans are expected to attend the free-ticketed event at Burton Constable near Hull, on 27 and 28 May.
