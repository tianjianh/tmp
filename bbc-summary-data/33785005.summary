Sammy-Jo Davies, 19, died and seven others were injured in Monday's crash on Bryn Terrace, Aberdare, during the early hours of Monday.
She was a passenger of a red van involved in the crash and was pronounced dead at the scene.
A 25-year-old man from Cwmaman has appeared in court charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
In a tribute from Miss Davies's family, they said her death has left a "huge hole" and she would be "dreadfully missed".
They added: "Sammy-Jo was a typical, normal 19-year-old girl who loved to party, who had her whole life ahead of her.
"Sammy-Jo had such a bubbly, infectious personality, she was always smiling, and she had a heart of gold, and would help anybody."
