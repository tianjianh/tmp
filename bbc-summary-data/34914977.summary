She comes from humble beginnings - she grew up in a trailer park and lived in a car until she got her big break.
Now she's as much an advocate as she is an actor with her campaigns for trans-gender rights as well as working with military families.
As part of the 100 Women season, Rajini Vaidyanathan talks to her about her rise to the top and being a woman in Hollywood.
Our 100 Women season showcases two weeks of inspirational stories about the BBC 100 Women and others who defy stereotypes around the world.
