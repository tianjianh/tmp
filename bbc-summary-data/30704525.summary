Plants with a potential street value of between Â£27,000 and Â£80,000 were found at the home in Trelawnyd in January.
Ian Anderson, 24, of Liverpool, was jailed for 16 months after admitting cultivating cannabis and abstracting electricity.
Mold Crown Court heard the fire was caused by an electrical fault.
Anderson agreed to care for the plants as a means to pay off a Â£5,000 drugs debt and had no influence on those above him in the chain, the court heard.
Judge Niclas Parry said the operation had all the hallmarks of a professional set up and while Anderson was a gardener and not the organiser, it was an important role.
