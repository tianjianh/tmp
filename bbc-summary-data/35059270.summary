Manannán Mac Lir was taken from its spot on the mountain near Limavady, County Londonderry, in January.
It was later found by a rambling group who then sought the help of soldiers on a training exercise.
A date has not yet been set for the new statue to be erected.
A spokesperson for Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said: "We are delighted that Mr Sutton has completed the new sculpture of Mannanán Mac Lir.
"We look forward to the return of the artwork at Gortmore viewpoint in the very near future."
The sculptor John Darren Sutton told the BBC he was "delighted".
"It takes a while to get these things right so I'm happy that he is ready.
"He'll be on his way to Limavady and the mountain soon."
The original sculpture, which had been badly damaged, was found about 300m from Gortmore viewpoint.
Thieves left a wooden cross in place of the statue with the words "you shall have no other gods before me".
The fibre glass statue sparked an online campaign and a missing persons appeal by police.
Former Limavady Borough Council agreed to replace the statue, at a cost of £10,000.
SDLP councillor Gerry Mullan said: "I'm very excited at the prospect of Manannán Mac Lir returning home.
"People from all over the world came to get photographs with it. Lets hope that happens again.
"I urge people to take care of him and we hope a similar act doesn't happen again.
"Santa may even stop by to see him."
