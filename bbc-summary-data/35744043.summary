Steve McClaren: Is Newcastle manager your #worstpremboss?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ask any football fan and they'll tell you who their club's worst manager is in a heartbeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The poor relationship with fans, bad signings, dreadful performances and even worse results will all come flooding back.
We asked Sportsday readers for their #worstpremboss and this is what they said:
lloyd davies @_lloyddavies  #worstpremboss has to be Terry Connor? 10+ games in charge of Wolves without a win...
Andy @SAFCsource No, not Roy Keane. He's not even OUR #worstpremboss
Oliver Chandler ‏@benchandler93  No worst Prem boss debate could be complete without a mention of Charlton's old Les 'Miserables' Reed. Truly abysmal record.
Damian Tabbinor ‏@charmingman83  Without a shadow of a doubt Steve Kean.
Charlie Large ‏@CharlieLarge  Stuart Pearce at #MCFC. Record low with 10 home goals in a season, and a beanie baby as some weird good luck charm!
Affy ‏@AffyAffyAffy  Louis van Gaal; Spent more than most in the worst PL year ever, with the best fans in England & he still can't finish in top four.
Adrian Reynolds ‏@adereynolds  Harry Redknapp at @SouthamptonFC Near three decades in the top fight, kept up everyone and he signs Nigel Quashie.
Ben Jacobs ‏@JacobsBen Peter Taylor. Signed Adi Akinbadbuy & Junior Lewis & took Leicester from Europe to the Championship. Oh & DON'T even mention Wycombe.
Jamie Rowland ‏@rowloefc  Mike Walker - he was so bad at Everton it was embarrassing!
Sam ‏@MaudzleySam  Sorry but Paul Jewell. Even though he saved Wigan he still has to be one of the worst?
Paul Jewell's Derby returned what is still the lowest points total in Premier League history (11) - but he spent barely any money and took over a Billy Davies team lacking any confidence - a team many thought had overachieved in winning promotion to the top flight anyway. He had also kept Bradford City up in the 1999-2000 season, the Bantams' first in the top flight for more than 70 years.
Is it really fair to look at the results of managers of promoted or traditional 'smaller' clubs? Chris Hutchings (Bradford and Wigan, 13% win percentage), for example. Or Brian Laws (17%), who had the job no-one really wanted when he replaced Owen Coyle at Championship-bound Burnley. Terry Connor was dealt the same hand at Wolves.
Some others who struggled didn't help themselves by suggesting they were the best coach in the Premier League or using cheese to help injured players.
But John Carver's 20% win ratio isn't the worst and he inherited a side which has continued to struggle without him, while Felix Magath might not even be Fulham's worst manager - they were already bottom when he took over.
What about those who are largely spared this ignominy of making the 'worst manager' lists - usually because they are good with the fans, or chalk up the odd League Cup semi-final appearance.
Those who spend money and fail - or spend money and don't do as well as expected. Like this lot:
The Chosen One, right? An excellent reputation all-but destroyed inside nine months. That was done with the help of £27.5m Marouane Fellaini and the others he spent £70m on as he took the Premier League champions and led them out of the top four. Still, a win ratio of 50% would be considered success at some clubs.
Ramos spent one year in charge of Tottenham. He also spent in the region of £70m, with some of those signings questioned by supporters, although £15m for Luka Modric seems a steal now. He was sacked with Spurs rooted to the foot of the table with no wins after eight games. A 29% win ratio.
Mark Hughes? Seriously? Hear us out. Hughes arrived in June 2008, three months before the huge Middle East investment that has since brought titles to the blue half of Manchester. He went on to spend some £270m over the next 12 months. But for every Vincent Kompany, there was a Tal Ben Haim. For every Carlos Tevez, a Jo. He got his marching orders after two wins in 11 games left City sixth in December 2009. Win ratio: 40%.
The England boss did not have a great time at Anfield. Despite a modest £20m outlay on a team who had reached the Europa League semi-finals the previous season (though Hodgson's Fulham reached the final), Liverpool were knocked out of the League Cup by Northampton Town and lost seven of Hodgson's 20 league games. A 2-1 home defeat to Blackpool meant they dropped into the bottom three of the top flight for the first time since September 1964. His 35% win ratio is the same as that achieved by Christian Gross at Spurs.
Won promotion from the Championship - then spent the best part of £75m on players who delivered him a 28% win ratio before he was sacked. He made Craig Gordon the most expensive goalkeeper in British football history.
Kean was in the role a full year after the local paper's front page declared it was "Time To Go" in November 2011. By the time he went, the club had slipped into the Championship. Kean's 22% win rate wasn't great, but it was the frequent declarations that seemed at odds with reality which did him no favours.
Like Kean and Sherwood, it's been argued McClaren is suffering from being at a dysfunctional club. But spending £83m and heading for the trap door to the Championship with a 21% win ratio - or to put it another way, being 1% better than John Carver after spending a small fortune on England internationals - is never going to bode well. The fans have had enough.
