The 28-year-old Wales forward joined the Warriors from Crusaders in 2012 and has made 90 appearances.
He was out of contract at the end of the season and there was reportedly interest from both Super League and National Rugby League teams.
"We believe that Ben is one of the best front-row forwards in Super League," said head coach Shaun Wane.
"We believe that he has his best years ahead of him and are delighted that those will be here at Wigan."
Flower was banned for six months in 2014 after punching St Helens' Lance Hohaia during the Grand Final that year, but returned in April last year to help Wigan reach the end-of-season showpiece again, where they were beaten by Leeds.
