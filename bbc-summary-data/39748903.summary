Natalia Fedorova was leaving her house when a man splashed the substance in her face and ran away, Moscow party branch head Sergei Mitrokhin said.
She had lost vision, but may regain her sight in time, he told Interfax.
He said he believed the attack was related to her campaign against property development in her area.
Mr Mitrokhin wrote in a tweet that the attack had taken place in Cheremushki, a suburb of Moscow.
Ms Fedorova had been taken to hospital with burns to her face and eyes, he later told Interfax news agency.
"She's a Yabloko member, but I don't think this is the reason. This is more likely to be a reaction to her campaigning," Mr Mitrokhin was quoted as saying.
"She's had her windows shot at already, and a coffin has been placed at her door," he said.
It comes a day after Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was taken to hospital after antiseptic green dye was splashed on his face in Moscow.
It was the second time he has been attacked with zelyonka ("brilliant green" in English) this year.
The dye is a common antiseptic in Russia and has been used in protests there and in Ukraine.
It is not clear who carried out the latest attack, which happened near the offices of the Anti-Corruption Fund (FBK) that he founded.
Mr Navalny is one of the foremost Russian critics of President Vladimir Putin and has announced his intention to run for president himself.
