Hasting Hotels bought Windsor House, Ireland's tallest office block, in the city centre in May for £6m.
The company announced its intention to convert the building into a hotel, named the Belfast Grand Central Hotel, that would eventually create 150 jobs.
Belfast City Council's planning committee met on Tuesday night and its members approved the £30m project.
Meanwhile, US insurance company Allstate's plans for a new office development near the former Maysfield Leisure Centre in Belfast were also given the go-ahead.
Concentrix, an American software company, had objected to the plans as it hopes to redevelop a neighbouring site.
Allstate's development is expected to create 200 jobs, as well as provide more than £100,000 worth of community benefits, according to council documents.
Plans from Queen's University for new student accommodation at Lennoxvale in south Belfast were withdrawn on Tuesday morning ahead of the meeting.
