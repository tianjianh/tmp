The visitors seemed on course for an unlikely victory when John Baird's excellent finish stunned Easter Road.
Former Hibs midfielder Tom Taiwo had been dismissed for a crunching first-half challenge on John McGinn.
The Bairns held firm until Hanlon connected with a floated McGinn delivery in the closing stages.
Hibs had further chances through McGinn and Grant Holt but were left frustrated at failing to overcome their depleted opponents.
Earlier, Craig Sibbald volleyed off target after Myles Hippolyte's pass came over his shoulder with only Ross Laidlaw to beat.
However, the tone of the match changed when Taiwo and McGinn went in for a robust challenge.
Taiwo appeared to dive in recklessly in catching his opposing midfielder and referee John Beaton produced a red card.
It became a contest of the irresistible force versus the immovable object as Hibs dominated possession and territory.
McGinn, Holt and Andrew Shinnie all went close but Falkirk frustrated their hosts.
Martin Boyle did find the net but was deemed offside and Hibs team-mate Fraser Fyvie was inches away with a shot across goalkeeper Danny Rogers.
Liam Fontaine had a glorious chance after Aaron Muirhead had denied him a clear header. But with the ball falling kindly just four yards out, the Hibs defender lacked composure and thrashing wide.
Falkirk's desire and organisation was impressive, as was the sucker punch of their goal.
Baird showed tremendous industry and guile to win a corner, then hooked home superbly to hand his side the chance of a sensational win.
Hibs' pressure was eventually rewarded when Hanlon rose to nod home but they could not find a winner, despite the best efforts of McGinn, who was twice denied by Rogers, and Holt, who came very close.
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: "We had total domination as you'd expect with 10 men. We should've won the game and they've scored from one corner.
"That's my frustration really, not the amount of goals we haven't scored, but the fact we conceded from a corner where we just lose our discipline. Three players going for the one ball; you don't defend like that.
"We showed enough character to get back into the game and on another day we'd have won the game comfortably. It's frustrating, but we're a point clear at the top of the league.
"I think it was a sending off; it's a two-foot challenge, his studs were up and he was late. I maybe need to see it again, but I wasn't surprised to see a red card."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "We saw footage of the sending off at half-time and I've asked referee John Beaton to look at it again.
"My opinion - and I wouldn't tell lies - is that John McGinn sort of goes in with two feet, and Tom goes in, and it was just a coming together. Tom wasn't off the ground and I think it was a very, very harsh sending off.
"I thought we'd started the match quite well, it was quite open and I think it changed the whole focus of the game. We then had to try to defend and sneak something.
"We're disappointed in some ways that we never took three points but, if I'm honest, I'm happy to take a point."
