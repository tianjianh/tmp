[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 0-1 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clayton Donaldson missed one penalty before scoring another as Birmingham City won at 10-man Fulham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donaldson's first spot-kick was saved by Cottagers keeper David Button after Che Adams was brought down in the box by Michael Madl.
Madl was then sent off for a second booking, for bringing down Donaldson.
The Blues striker then made amends for his penalty miss in the second half as he blasted in from the spot after Adams was fouled by Floyd Ayite.
The defeat was Fulham's first of the season and saw Birmingham move above them in the Championship table.
Donaldson went close to opening the scoring early on but his shot was blocked by Madl, who was then booked for giving away the first penalty of the afternoon for bringing down Adams with a fierce challenge.
Striker Donaldson stepped up to take the kick, which was turned away by Button, but minutes into the second half he made up for that miss by blasting his second opportunity into the centre of the net after Adams was tripped by Ayite.
Fulham were reduced to 10 men before the break when Madl received his second booking for a mistimed sliding tackle.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"Birmingham played better than we did today and they deserved the points.
"We made so many mistakes during the game and had possession of the ball but not enough with our offensive players.
"If it's one game with so many mistakes then it's my responsibility - we have to continue to work hard.
"I want to play from the back, it's generally what my teams try to follow. But we made many mistakes and didn't have enough quality in the game."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett:
"I told (Jacques) Maghoma to take the penalty - Mags was meant to take the second pen. But fair play to Clayton, he showed a lot of bottle to take it.
"Mags told him he wasn't taking it and they sorted it out between themselves. I was nervous and didn't want him [Donaldson] to take it but he showed character.
"The first one [penalty] wasn't bad to be fair, it was an excellent save, and the second time he didn't give him any chance."
