[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales lock Luke Charteris could be a doubt for the summer fixtures against England and New Zealand because of family and club commitments.

His wife is due to give birth around the end of May.
"The more important thing is that my wife is due another baby, so that will be my first priority," Charteris told BBC Wales Sport.
"We'll see how that goes, hopefully everything goes well there and then I can make a decision after that."
The child is due to be born in France, where 33 year-old Charteris is in the final months of his contract with Paris side Racing 92 before moving to Bath.
Wales are due to face England at Twickenham on 29 May, before a three-Test tour of New Zealand, also including a fixture against Waikato Chiefs.
The French Top 14 final will not be played until 24 June, only hours before the final Test in New Zealand, and Racing are strong contenders for the title.
"I don't know, I'll cross that bridge when we get there," said Charteris when asked about his Wales availability.
"I want to be doing as well as we can with Racing and put ourselves in a position to win some silverware, and see what happens down the line. The honest answer is I'm not really sure."
Charteris has made three starts and one replacement appearance during the 2016 Six Nations, taking his caps total to 66.
"It's a big end of the season for a lot of boys who were in the World Cup, so it's been a long year," admitted Charteris.
"We'll go back to our clubs now, some will have a bit of rest, some have got big games coming up.
"We look forward to getting back together in a few months time and it's a great way to finish the season off."
