Lib Dem manifesto summary: Key points at-a-glance

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Liberal Democrats have launched their manifesto, Change Britain's Future. The full document is available online. Here are the main things you need to know.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A programme providing voters with an "opportunity to change Britain's future - by changing the opposition" - a choice between "the extreme and divisive Brexit that Theresa May has chosen for Britain" and a Labour Party "that has given up on opposition".
Tim Farron's foreword says: "I want the Liberal Democrats to be the party that holds Theresa May to account over spending on the National Health Service; our young people's education, skills and opportunities; the protection of our precious environment; and our future relationship with Europe."
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron tells the BBC his party is the only one offering people hope "that Britain's future could be brighter".
"At the heart of our manifesto is an offer to all of the people in our country that no other party is making, and that's that you don't have to accept whatever deal we get back from the Brexit negotiations," he said.
"The British people - 'you' - should have the final say, and if you don't like what Theresa May comes back with, you should have the right to vote to remain [in the EU]."
Analysis
By political correspondent Tom Symonds
The Lib Dems have shunned the political option that gave them power in 2010 - the possibility of a coalition deal. But they have a new purpose, according to their leader. A second referendum.
Tim Farron, who was confronted by an angry pro-Brexit critic in Kidlington last week, knows he has to accept the result of the vote to leave, but backing a second ballot gives his party's offer of a home to remainers some meaning.
He hopes that when the stark details of the future Brexit deal emerge, leavers will feel less like leaving. A vote on the deal would become another vote on whether we should leave at all.
Other than that, the party's manifesto shadows Labour's thesis, that voters want to see Conservative tax and spending cuts reversed. But it is the straightforward offer of a referendum which makes it different.
Conservative Party chairman Sir Patrick McLoughlin: "This manifesto makes one thing abundantly clear: a vote for the Lib Dems is a vote to put Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. From increasing taxes to borrowing more, from putting our security at risk to scrapping Trident, these policies are an echo of Corbyn's manifesto we saw earlier this week."
Green party co-leader Jonathan Bartley: "The Lib Dems are trying to repair their broken relationship with young people but these pledges will never be enough to win back the young voters they betrayed in coalition with the Tories. While the Green Party shares some similar policies, such as votes at 16, banning fracking and taking in more refugees, how can we trust the Lib Dems to actually implement them?"
Paul Johnson, Institute of Fiscal Studies: "Rather like the Labour Party, the Lib Dems want to have a big increase in investment spending - whereas Labour was talking about £250bn, the Liberal Democrats are talking about £100bn, I think over five years, although that's not wholly clear. But secondly, they're talking about increasing spending more than they're going to increase taxes. That's an interesting difference from what Labour was trying to do."
Political scientist Prof John Curtice, University of Strathclyde: "The 2015 election was a disaster for the party - they only managed to get eight seats, 8% of the vote... The problem for the party seems to be that so far it's not clear that it's going to do much better this time. Usually during election campaigns, Lib Dems often begin to take off in the polls, not least because they start to get publicity that they otherwise lack. So far in this election, Liberal Democrats seemed to start off at 10-11% and now they seem to be back to the 8% that they had in 2015."
CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn: "The Liberal Democrat Party rightly places planning for the economy of the future at the heart of its manifesto, with a clear focus on spurring innovation and entrepreneurship, and on delivering a world-class education for our children to equip them with the skills to succeed... However, as we chart a new course in our relationship with Europe, it's all the more important that the United Kingdom remains a highly attractive country in which to invest and create jobs. Reversing cuts to corporation tax and not getting behind Heathrow's expansion will limit the country's ability to remain internationally competitive."
Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry:  "The pharmaceutical industry welcomes the Liberal Democrats' focus on investing in science and innovation to grow the UK economy and deliver prosperity... So while the additional £6bn a year for the NHS is an important commitment that is welcome by industry, we are concerned that the Liberal Democrats' manifesto plans for healthcare fail to tackle the trend of poor patient access to the latest medical innovations in the UK."
Institute of Economic Affairs director general Mark Littlewood: "The Liberal Democrats would increase current (day-to-day) spending by £30bn, nearly £20bn less than the Labour Party. What's more, rather than pay for all of this straight away, the cost would be divided between £16bn of tax rises and £14bn in borrowing. This does at least reduce the immediate hit on the economy from higher taxes and might even provide a small fiscal boost, but only by delaying the pain."
