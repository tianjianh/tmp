Daniel Climance was struck by the vehicle while out riding his bike at about 19:20 BST on Wednesday on Station Road in Purton, near Swindon.
He died at the scene. Wiltshire Police described it as a "tragic accident".
In a statement issued through the force, Daniel's family said he would be "sadly missed" by his brothers.
"Daniel was a local Wiltshire lad who divided his time equally between his mum in north Swindon and his Dad in Purton," the statement continued.
It said he was in his final year at Bridlewood Primary School and was looking forward to starting Bradon Forest School in September, joining his older brother Robbie.
"Daniel was a beautiful, loving child, with a fantastic sense of humour, caring and loving with a wide circle of friends," it said.
"He will be sadly missed by his brothers Robbie, George and Noah, and all of the extended family."
Daniel, who "loved" playing football for the Wootton Bassett under-11 team, had just completed his second-degree black belt in Taekwondo, of which he was "immensely proud", his family added.
Police said the roadsweeper was travelling towards Hook and was not believed to have been operating at the time.
