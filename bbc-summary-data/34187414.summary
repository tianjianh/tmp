McGhee says Scotland will give all for wins in final qualifiers

Scotland assistant Mark McGhee insists the nation can still reach the Euro 2016 play-offs despite no longer having their destiny in their own hands.

The Scots, losers to Germany on Monday, need at least four points from their last two games and for other results to go their way to reach the play-offs.
Poland visit Scotland before Gordon Strachan's side travel to face Gibraltar in October's double-header.
"We will re-gather and do our utmost to win the two games," said McGhee.
"We still have a chance. We still feel there is enough in us to get six points from the two games to come.
"Then we have to see what happens elsewhere and that's the disappointing thing, that we're relying on other results."
Should Scotland take four points and Republic of Ireland lose to Group D leaders Germany and then Poland, Strachan's men would beat the Irish to the play-off spot.
Another scenario that would allow Scotland to reach the play-offs involves Poland losing to Scotland and Republic of Ireland and the Scots also beating Gibraltar.
Friday's 1-0 defeat in Georgia set Scotland back compared to their Group D rivals, who all won in Tbilisi and Scotland cannot catch group leaders Germany, who are on 19 points.
McGhee believes the Scots have shown enough quality in the campaign so far to be confident that Poland can be overcome at Hampden before the final tie away to Gibraltar.
He admits, though, that addressing the poor display in Tbilisi is more important than taking positives from a better performance in the 3-2 loss to the Germans.
"We feel we can win the two games despite the performance in Georgia and the result," he added.
"Ireland [have the numerical advantage], although they have two hugely difficult games. Would I rather be in our position or be in Ireland's position playing against Poland and Germany? I'm not sure. Maybe we can quietly think that we're in a better position because of that.
"You've got to discount everything you saw last night. They're the world champions, the game was a spectacle, it was a fantastic occasion to have them and if we'd beaten Georgia, it would have been a carnival night, despite the result.
"We forget that performance, we have to look more closely at the Georgia performance and improve on that to beat Poland. We've played Poland already, we drew with them over there and we've had other good results. It's the elements of those games that we have to take to the Poland game.
"It was a totally different set of circumstances [against Georgia], it's not the same thing. Goals change games and Georgia got the first goal, which was critical.
"Had we got the first goal it would have been different. But they got the first goal, they played 5-4-1, it allowed them to sit in and make it really difficult for us. We weren't good enough on the night, we didn't play well enough to break them down, which was disappointing, but losing the first goal was the critical moment."
