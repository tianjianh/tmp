Wrexham car arsonist jailed over spate of attacks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An arsonist has been jailed for four years for torching cars in Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Lloyd Paul Evans, 38, denied seven charges of starting fires early on 24 October. He previously admitted setting fire to another car.
Four cars were targeted but the fires affected other vehicles, Mold Crown Court heard.
The judge said Evans could not have been responsible for other car fires in the area as he had been in custody at the time.
After the hearing, Det Chief Insp Neil Harrison said: "In recent years the Wrexham area has been overwhelmed by the number of arsons taking place, particularly where vehicles have been set on fire.
"The sentence given to Evans today should serve as warning to others that arson is a serious offence and it will not be tolerated."
Henry Hills, defending, said his client was engaging with the mental health services while in prison.
He had been on a 12-week suspended sentence at the time after admitting setting fire to another car. That sentence will now run consecutively.
