The Muslim Council of Scotland has called for calm following the death of a shopkeeper in Glasgow.

Asad Shah, 40, was killed in what Police Scotland said they were treating as a "religiously prejudiced" attack.
A 32-year-old Muslim man has been arrested in connection with the incident.
Hundreds of people attended a vigil near the scene in Shawlands on Friday night and local residents have been continuing to lay floral tributes.
Mr Shah, 40, was found seriously injured in Minard Road at about 21:05 on Thursday. He died in hospital.
The incident happened hours after he apparently posted social media messages wishing his customers a happy Easter.
Salah Beltagui, director of the Muslim Council of Scotland, told BBC Scotland: "People are really shocked and very, very distressed that something like this has happened.
"After this event, our message is that everyone should keep calm and try to get together in recognition of being human beings.
"There's a real feeling of sadness and anxiousness within the community. Hopefully we can learn from it."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety were among those at the vigil on Friday night.
Those attending were encouraged to bring a daffodil and many laid flowers and lit candles during the gathering.
Mr Beltagui added: "As we saw last night with the vigil in the street, there was a good number of people feeling that they wanted some outlet to share their feelings and this is the best thing we can do - share our feelings.
"Muslims believe that life is given by God and is sacred in the sense that nobody should interfere with it. There is no reason at all to take a human life."
Shopkeeper Mr Shah has been described by local residents as a "much-loved" and "humble and sweet" man.
Among those gathering near the scene on Saturday was Aleesa Malik, 17, who said: "He would take the effort to care for every customer.
"He would want to know how are you, what are you doing. He took an interest in everyone's lives - old, young, anyone."
