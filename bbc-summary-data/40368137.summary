Oscar, 25, appeared to kick the ball straight at two players from opponents Guangzhou R&F during Sunday's match, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
The Brazilian was pushed to the ground before players from both sides fought.
Oscar, who joined Shanghai SIPG in a £60m deal in January, was also fined 40,000 Yuan (£4,620).
The incident came in first-half injury time, and Shanghai's Fu Huan and Guangzhou's Li Zixiang were sent off for their part in the brawl, but Oscar was not booked.
Fu and Li have received six and five-game bans respectively from the Chinese Football Association, while Guangzhou's Chen Zhizhao, who pushed Oscar to the floor, has been banned for seven league games.
Shanghai boss Andre Villas-Boas defended Oscar afterwards, saying he was "just being passionate", and Oscar denied he purposely aimed the ball at Guangzhou players.
"Disrespect the opponent? It is not true. I am a very dedicated player and respect sportsmanship," Oscar was quoted as saying on the Sina Sports website.
Shanghai are second in the Chinese Super League after 13 of their 30 matches.
