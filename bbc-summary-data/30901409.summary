Craig Gascoyne, who has won six medals at two Island Games, is not a member of Jersey's seven-strong squad.
Gascoyne was part of the Jersey team which
"There was a number of players in contention and we had to think very carefully about the final selection," selector Tom Quinn told BBC Jersey.
"I think the fact that the selection took so long reflects on the quality of players we have available to select."
Gascoyne is the island's table tennis development officer and only once failed to win a medal in any event he has played in at the Island Games.
Table tennis was omitted form the programme in Bermuda in 2013, but Gascoyne was part of the side that went to the Isle of Wight in 2011 and Aland in 2009.
"We're hoping to grab as many medals as possible at the games," said Quinn, who would not comment on individual players.
"We have one player who is 21 and the rest are under 17, so it really shows the strength of table tennis at a junior level. "
Jersey 2015 Island Games table tennis team: Josh Band, Tyler Gosselin, Hugo Tupper, Jordan Wykes, Kelsey Le Maistre, Josie Marshall, Sofia Uddnas.
