Armed response units and a police helicopter were deployed after a number of people reported concerns about the fundraiser's outfit.
Norfolk Police were called to the Whitefriars area of Norwich at about 8:30 GMT.
They said the man was given "strong words of advice" by officers.
The BBC understands the man told police he was raising money on Red Nose Day.
Last month, the force dispatched a helicopter to reports of a sword-wielding man who was later found to be a student with a toy machete.
Ch Insp Chris Spinks said: "This is the second, similar high-profile incident which has taken place in the last month.
"We would like to remind people to think carefully about the consequences of carrying imitation weapons and of their general appearance which, as in this case, could be misconstrued by other members of the public."
