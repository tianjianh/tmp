The pre-tournament odds-on favourite was cruising at 3-1 before the Spaniard fought back with brilliant darts and looked set to level the scores.
Reyes lost 4-2 but finished with an average of 106.07 - the highest for a losing player in tournament history.
Earlier, fourteen-time champion Phil Taylor beat Kevin Painter 4-0.
He gave me more game than Phil Taylor and  Gary Anderson
"It was winning ugly - it wasn't the best game in the world," Taylor said after the scrappy encounter.
Van Gerwen now plays Darren Webster for a place in the quarter-finals.
The Dutchman paid tribute to Reyes: "He played phenomenally- I've never seen him play this well.
"He gave me more game than Taylor and [world champion] Gary Anderson."
Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld dropped only two legs on his way to a 4-0 victory over England's Alan Norris.
"I feel comfortable and confident. When you feel like that, you can beat all of them," the 2007 champion said.
Earlier, two-time PDC semi-finalist Mark Webster survived a fightback from Austrian eighth seed Mensur Suljovic to progress.
Webster led 3-1 but was forced into a decider by Suljovic, who was a European Championship finalist in October.
Northern Ireland's Daryl Gurney recorded a 4-3 win over Scottish ninth seed Robert Thornton and Dave Chisnall beat Chris Dobey 4-2 in an all-England clash.
