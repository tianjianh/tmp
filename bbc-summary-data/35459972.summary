[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Argentine pre-season friendly between Estudiantes and arch-rivals Gimnasia La Plata was abandoned following a brawl among the players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sunday's match was called off in stoppage time after players aimed punches and kicks at each other.
Television pictures showed Gimnasia players kicking Estudiantes goalkeeper Mariano Andujar when on the ground.
It comes a week after five players were sent off during River Plate's friendly with Boca Juniors.
In this latest incident, two players - Estudiantes defender Alvaro Pereira and Gimnasia goalkeeper Enrique Bologna - had been sent off, before Estudiantes' Santiago Ascacibar fouled a Gimnasia player from behind and was given the third red card of the game.
As he left the field, Ascacibar was surrounded by angry Gimnasia players, prompting Estudiantes substitutes to run on to the pitch to intervene.
Estudiantes coach Nestor Vivas, whose side were leading 1-0 when the game was abandoned, said: "The referee can make mistakes but it was the two teams who were in the wrong."
