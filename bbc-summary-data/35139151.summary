The visitors had the best chance of the first half as Ajay Leitch-Smith's drilled shot cannoned off the post.
Sam Foley should have given Vale the lead but he ballooned his shot over the bar from close range.
With the game seemingly heading for a draw, Maddison danced his way past two Vale defenders before unleashing a shot into the net to seal the win.
Coventry remain unbeaten at home in League One this season.
Sky Blues manager Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire:
"For the group it was a very important win. I think they knew how important it was, but they started the game like we'd all had too much turkey yesterday.
"It wasn't just me - there was a discussion at half-time to get us going, and the second half was a lot better.
"The points are important. The days when you don't play so well but get the points are always huge. On the second-half display, we deserved to take the three points."
