[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Carl Nicholson, 44, was said to be so obsessed by women's clothing, he went on a hunt for garments just five days after being freed on a suspended sentence for previous burglaries.
Exeter Crown Court heard Nicholson, of Cheshire Road, Exmouth, was once arrested in a pub while wearing a red basque he had stolen.
He has been jailed for 30 months.
Nicholson, who admitted burglary, also saw his two-year suspended sentence activated, making his total prison sentence four and a half years.
Judge Erik Salomonsen told him: "You have a very long record for burglary. You were given a chance last time and you have let down those who tried to help you."
The court heard Nicholson was caught after being disturbed during a burglary on 2 September 2015.
Mr Richard Crabb, defending, said Nicholson was a persistent rather than a professional burglar who was keen to address the problems that led to his offences.
