Jessica Hedley, 25, tried to save David Christie with first aid following the crash on the A92 near Freuchie.
She had denied causing his death by careless driving, but pled guilty on the second day of her trial last month.
Hedley had been overtaking a truck at about 04:30 on 21 February 2015.
She hit Mr Christie who was travelling home to Ladybank after going to an all-night garage in Freuchie.
Dundee Sheriff Court heard the 49-year-old was riding a bike equipped with a light and was wearing a high-visibility yellow tabard when the crash happened.
Martin Green, 31, a close family friend of Mr Christie, was the last person to see him before he went out on his bike to make the two mile trip to the garage.
Mr Green said: "I had been with him all day and night. We had been drinking on and off.
"He got changed and went to cycle to Freuchie to get cigarettes.
"I expected him to be back in about 40 minutes but I got concerned when he didn't come back and phoned the police."
Defence solicitor Ross Donnelly said Hedley has been extremely remorseful from the outset.
"This incident has had a considerable impact on her and she has required treatment for panic attacks, anxiety and depression," he said.
Hedley will now face an inquiry by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.
