Ms Daniels was discovered in the back garden of Barlow's home after a neighbour alerted police, the court heard.
Barlow was found inside the property in blood-stained clothing and was charged with her murder the following day, police said.
A post-mortem examination found Ms Daniels' death was caused by multiple stab wounds to her face and neck.
A statement from her family said: "We have received justice but no amount of sentence was ever going to be enough as we are the ones facing the true life sentence, which is without Fay.
"We are heartbroken. She was loved by many and will be dearly missed."
