Hendrie joined the Hammers from Hamilton for an undisclosed fee in July 2015, having made 117 appearances for the Scottish club.
The 21-year-old, who has won three caps for Scotland's under-21 squad, has yet to feature for West Ham's senior team.
Hendrie could make his debut for the Shrimpers when they visit Peterborough United on Saturday.
"I spoke to his former manager, Alex Neil, to ask about the type character we're bringing in," manager Phil Brown told the club website.
"He says he's a solid character, reliable, got bags of energy and probably his biggest asset will be his legs, as he can run all day.
"He brings a lovely left foot to the party, as Ben Coker does, so he's got a great opportunity to get his career going in England at Southend United."
