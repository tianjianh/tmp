Alun Wyn Jones: Ospreys must not 'get carried away' in Europe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ospreys must keep their feet on the ground after gaining six points in their opening two European Champions Cup games, captain Alun Wyn Jones says.

Ospreys top Pool 2 ahead of Exeter and Clermont Auvergne, although the French side have played only one game.
Clermont beat Ospreys 34-29 on Sunday, but the Welsh region's two bonus points made it a successful trip.
"It's an interesting group, we can't afford to get carried away," Jones said.
"The kick-in to see where we actually stand will be when Clermont play the game they didn't last week."
The French side were runners-up in last year's tournament and have now won 24 European matches in a row at their Stade Marcel Michelin home.
Their opening weekend match against Bordeaux-Begles was postponed following the Paris attacks, with no date yet set for the re-scheduled game.
Bordeaux are Ospreys' next opponents in the competition, with the teams meeting on consecutive weekends in December.
"We go back-to-back with Bordeaux. I think we'll approach it in the same way [as the Clermont game], we'll have to come at it with confidence but we've got a couple of Pro12 games we've got to do well in as well," Jones said.
The Wales and Lions second row added he was proud of the way the team had rallied from 34-17 down with two minutes left to score two tries in the dying seconds and claim a losing bonus point, and a point for scoring four touchdowns.
"To come away with two [points] we should be proud - there aren't many teams that will come out here and score four tries," he added.
"Credit to the team, we didn't say we'd turn them over and we haven't, but we didn't lack confidence and I think that showed."
Ospreys face Cardiff Blues in a Welsh derby on Saturday.
