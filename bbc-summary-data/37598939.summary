Former Manchester City men Stevan Jovetic and Stefan Savic both netted as Montenegro thrashed Kazakhstan 5-0.
Romania won at Armenia by the same scoreline in the same group, after the hosts were reduced to 10 men through Gor Malakyan's third minute red card.
A surprise scoreline in Group C saw Azerbaijan beat Norway 1-0, with defender Maksim Medvedev the match winner. The result means the Azeris have a 100% record after two games.
