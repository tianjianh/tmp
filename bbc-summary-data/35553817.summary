Eamon Bradley: Judge warns over 'delays' in Derry Syria trial

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a Londonderry man charged with committing terrorist offences in the Middle East could be dismissed if there are any further delays, a judge has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eamon Bradley, from Benview Estate in Coshquin, was arrested in October 2014, after he returned from Syria.
He faces charges including providing training in the making of or use of firearms in Syria.
On Thursday his preliminary hearing, set in December, was due to take place.
However, the prosecution told Londonderry Magistrates' Court that the case could not go ahead without consent papers signed by the Advocate General in London.
The prosecution said those papers had been sent, but had not yet returned to Northern Ireland.
The defence told the court that the delay was "not acceptable" as Mr Bradley had been on bail for a long period of time.
In response, the judge issued what is known as a 'McAleenan warning', which gives him the power to refuse to return a defendant for trial if there are long delays in the case.
The judge told the court he was not stating that he would refuse to return Mr Bradley, but warned the prosecution to delay the case no further, telling them to "get on with it".
He added: "I am sure the Advocate General or whoever is extremely busy but they could have found time to scrawl their signature on the papers."
The date for the preliminary hearing was moved to 3 March.
