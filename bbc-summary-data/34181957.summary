Boro broke the deadlock when Diego Fabbrini cleverly played Cristhian Stuani through to poke the ball home.
But Brentford restored parity when keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos miscued his clearance into the path of Lasse Vibe.
Stuani made it 2-1 after powering home Albert Adomah's cross before the latter got Boro's third at the near post.
Middlesbrough took the lead when Stuani latched onto a ball inside the box from Diego Fabbrini to tap home.
The hosts had a goal disallowed when Fabbrini again sent a ball into the box which was met by David Nugent, but his effort was given offside.
Brentford equalised after Konstantopoulos attempted to clear a ball into the box but mistakenly played the ball to Vibe, who easily slotted the ball into the net.
In an end-to-end second half, Boro could have taken the lead when Adomah crossed to Nugent but his header was blocked, before Judge's lobbed chance went just wide of the mark for the Bees.
Boro were back in front when Adomah sent a superb cross into the box, which was met by the onrushing Stuani, who struck the ball past Bees keeper David Button.
Provider turned scorer soon after when Adomah went on a terrific run and finished superbly from a tight angle to notch Boro's third.
Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka: "Cristhian Stuani is a very good player and I expect a lot from him this season.
"It wasn't easy for him to come here. But he's an experienced player and he can score goals.
"I think he can score more goals than Patrick Bamford did. Christian is more experienced, hopefully he can score the same or more."
Brentford boss Marinus Dijkhuizen: "There was a lot of good football from my team and we created a lot of big chances.
"We created the same number of chances but the quality of their finishing was the difference.
"They also bring a lot of quality from the bench. They're a very good side. But the chances are so big for us and the fact we created three is a complement to us because Middlesbrough defend very well."
