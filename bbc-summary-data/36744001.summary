The water reached one metre deep on Avenue Road in Primrose Hill.
The basement and ground floor of one building flooded and about 50 residents were evacuated from a block of flats.
Thames Water said it had stemmed the flow of water and the excess water was draining away. It will then clean the road before working out how to best fix the pipe.
Fire station manager Matt Burrows said sandbags were laid down to protect as many properties as possible.
"Avenue Road is a long residential street and is used as a bit of a thoroughfare [and] this is causing quite bit of disruption, so avoid the area if you can," he said.
