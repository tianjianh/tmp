Watson, 23, was back in action for the first time since claiming her third WTA title at the Monterrey Open on Sunday.
The world number 53 won the first set on a tie-break before her Kazakh opponent levelled the match, but Watson hit back to win 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 6-1.
"When it was important, I was able to bring out my best tennis," Watson said.
Watson, who was granted a wildcard after reaching the fourth round last year, plays Romanian 32nd seed Monica Niculescu in round two.
