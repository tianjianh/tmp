The 57-year-old man was dragged into inadequately guarded machinery in the paint shop at the Lode Lane, Solihull, site in June 2013, it said.
He punctured both lungs, broke 10 ribs and was in an induced coma in intensive care for 12 days, HSE said.
It added JLR was fined for safety breaches after pleading guilty.
The maintenance electrician, from Northfield, Birmingham, also broke his breastbone, two bones in his spine and two in his right hand and had blood clots on his heart and kidneys, HSE said.
Speaking after the hearing, it said the incident was "entirely preventable".
Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, of Abbey Road, Whitley, Coventry, was fined £40,000 with £13,474 costs after pleading guilty to breaching Regulation 11(1) of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations, HSE said.
In a statement, a JLR spokesman said: "The safety and wellbeing of our workforce is an integral strategic imperative across our entire business.
"We continue to work tirelessly to ensure the protection of our employees remains our highest priority."
