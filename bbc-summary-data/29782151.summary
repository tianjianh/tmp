Three men, one of them wearing a Ku Klux Klan (KKK) outfit, have tried to enter Parliament House in Canberra.

The men are reportedly calling for a nationwide ban on the full-face Islamic veil.
One of the three was wearing a motorbike helmet and the third had donned a Muslim niqab.
Earlier this month, parliament said anyone visiting the building with their face covered would have to sit in a separate area of the public gallery.
That ruling, subsequently overturned, sparked intense national debate about the Islamic veil and about possible discrimination against Muslim women.
The three men were met by a security official outside the building on Monday morning, who told them they could not enter parliament wearing a helmet or a KKK hood.
Local media have named the men as Sergio Redegalli, Nick Folkes and Victor Waterson.
Their protest movement "Faceless" reportedly opposes burkas or niqabs being worn in public spaces and claims Islam's "political ideology" is "contrary" to Australian beliefs.
"It seems that you're allowed to wear a full-face covering into Parliament if you're a Muslim woman, but no other group is allowed to have that same privilege," Mr Redegalli told local media.
"We, as males, are not allowed to wear any face coverings in Parliament House."
Under Parliament House security rules, Muslim women wearing a burka or niqab are allowed inside once they have shown their face at the normal security checkpoint.
Niqabs are full-length garments where only the eyes are visible and burkas are also full-length but no part of the face can be seen.
