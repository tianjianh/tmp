The 30-year-old has moved in a bid to resurrect his career, having made only two first-team appearances for Dragons during the 2015-16 season.
Dragons have stated that Brew has left them "by mutual consent".
Brew has won nine caps for Wales, but has not featured for his country at international level since June, 2012.
Dragons' statement said: "He has struggled with injuries during his latest spell with the Dragons following his return from Biarritz Olympique.
"His opportunities have been limited as a result and he leaves by mutual consent."
Dragons head coach Kingsley Jones said Brew had left the region on good terms.
"This is a decision that suits both parties and will hopefully allow Aled to gain a fresh start and more game time at another club. We wish him well," Jones said,
Former Dragons boss Darren Edwards is now part of Bath's coaching staff.
