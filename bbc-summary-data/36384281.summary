A Belfast woman has admitted obstructing police in connection with the murder of a man in County Down in April 2015.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Kyle Neil, 23, was discovered in the boot of a car at Windsor Road in south Belfast.
On Wednesday, Stephanie Todd, 26, of Russell Court in Belfast, pleaded guilty to obstructing police in connection with the murder.
She has also admitted driving with excess alcohol.
Her co-accused, Wesley Harry Vance, 27, formerly of Church Gate Studios in Comber pleaded guilty to Mr Neil's murder earlier this week.
Previously, Todd had denied two charges of assisting offenders by allegedly driving a car with Mr Neil's body in the boot from Mill Street, Comber to Windsor Road in Belfast on 12 April 2015 and driving the car with excess alcohol.
She was due to be tried by a jury, but following legal discussions, a new charge was added to the bill of indictment.
When Todd was charged with obstructing a constable in the execution of his duties on 12 April 2015, she replied "guilty." She was re-arraigned on the driving with excess alcohol charge, which she also admitted.
A prosecuting barrister said that in light of these pleas, the Crown was prepared to leave the assisting offenders charge "on the books, not to be proceeded with".
The jury was then dismissed by the judge, who also released Todd on bail.
She will be sentenced alongside Vance at Belfast Crown Court next month.
