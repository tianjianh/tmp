Swindon-based Gaming International (GI) agreed a deal on Friday, which they hope will go through early this week.
"I don't know what their plans are with the club," Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"They're the new owners of the club, so they are in a position where whatever they choose to do with me, with the club and everything else they're well within their rights to do it."
Nicholson is due to meet the new owners on Monday to hear more about their plans for the Gulls, who were relegated from the Football League in 2014.
"Until I've sat and had a chat with them and heard what they've had to say, and I get a chance to put my side of it over and explain to them where I think we need to improve and what we need to do, then there's not much I can say," added Nicholson.
"I took the job last year and my targets haven't changed, my targets are to give this club back to the community, to get the club back in the Football League and to be around to see that."
The takeover ended a period of uncertainty surrounding the club, which had been due to pay GI a loan of Â£125,000 in January.
The company had lent the Torquay board the cash during their initial takeover talks, which broke down in July.
