[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 0-1 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Richie Bennett stepped off the bench to fire a stoppage-time winner as Barrow beat North Ferriby for their first league success on the road this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bennett, a 62nd-minute replacement for Ross Hannah, hit the crossbar in the closing stages before grabbing the decisive goal in time added on.
Neither side created a clear-cut goalscoring chance in a goalless first half.
Barrow's appeals for a penalty when Hannah collided with home goalkeeper Rory Watson were waved away, while North Ferriby striker Curtis Bateson flashed a shot-come-cross just wide.
Both sides went in search of the opening goal in the second period and Ferriby striker Ryan Kendall forced Barrow goalkeeper Joel Dixon into a good block in the 51st minute before team-mate Ben Middleton dragged a shot wide.
Bennett went closest to breaking the deadlock when he headed Jordan Williams' throw-in against the crossbar with five minutes left and then the substitute snatched a last-gasp victory, converting from inside the box.
