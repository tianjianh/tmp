[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Cross, 37, was found with stab wounds at her house in Hemel Hempstead on Monday, an hour after police were called to the same street over reports of a man behaving suspiciously.
Her body was discovered after officers responding to a separate call about a break-in at a neighbour's house heard a disturbance from next door.
Marcin Porczynski, 25, has been charged with Ms Cross's murder.
He also faces two counts of kidnap and a charge of burglary relating to a neighbouring property in Dunlin Road, police said.
Mr Porczynski, from Claymore Avenue, Hemel Hempstead, is due to appear at Hatfield Remand Court on Thursday.
Two children were in the house when officers found Ms Cross's body. Police said they were physically unharmed.
Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said the children were safe and with family.
Ms Cross's death was a "tragic and isolated incident," he said, and sought to reassure people such events were "highly unusual within Hertfordshire."
Hertfordshire Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in relation to the case.
A 19-year-old man from Hemel Hempstead arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to burgle has been released on police bail until 24 September.
