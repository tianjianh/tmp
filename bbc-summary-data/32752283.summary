[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 4x4 had to be winched to safety in Swansea after it got stuck in the sea, the coastguard said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vehicle got into difficulty in wet sand after the driver had retrieved his rigid inflatable boat at The Mumbles on Friday.
The alarm was raised at 11:45 BST, as the tide reached above its wheels.
A recovery firm pulled the 4x4 clear, with no one injured, Milford Haven Coastguard said.
