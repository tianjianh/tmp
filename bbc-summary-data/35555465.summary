[SN]TITLE[SN]
Judgement reserved in trial of south Armagh couple accused of terrorist offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Judgement has been reserved in the trial of a south Armagh couple accused of terrorist offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith McConnan, 21, and Orla O'Hanlon, 20, faced a number of charges, including making a bomb in a bungalow in Forkhill.
Mr McConnan, from Tievecom Road in Forkhill and Ms O'Hanlon, Church Road, Forkhill, denied all the charges.
After listening to final submissions, the judge said she wanted time to consider before giving her judgement.
The trial at Belfast Crown Court heard that police officers acting under the Justice and Security Act searched their home in December 2013.
During the search several items, including an industrial grinder and a complete timer power unit were seized, along with crushed ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
The prosecution alleged the grinder had been used to grind down the ammonium nitrate fertiliser.
The prosecution also made the case that the combination of the items and explosives found in the premises indicated that the occupants of the house - Mr McCannon and Ms O'Hanlon - were "committing acts ... for the preparation of manufacturing explosives and making a bomb".
Closing the prosecution case, the judge was informed that two charges that the couple initially faced - namely making explosives with intent to endanger life, and possessing explosives with intent to endanger life - were no longer being proceeded with.
During the trial, Mr McConnan gave evidence and claimed that he did use a grinder on two occasions but claimed he sabotaged any plans to make explosives as he did not want to be involved in something that could kill.
He also made the case that he was acting under duress from a man he would only name as Mr X.
Ms O'Hanlon, who declined to give evidence, admitted knowing about the presence of the grinder in her home and owning it - but her lawyer argued that there was no evidence to suggest she was present when the ammonium nitrate was ground up.
The barrister said that in the case of his client, the prosecution had "failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt" that Ms O'Hanlon was in possession of any of the "offending articles".
After listening to final submissions from both the prosecution and the defence, the judge said she wanted to reserved her judgement until a later date.
