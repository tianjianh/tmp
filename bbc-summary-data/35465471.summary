[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Storm Henry has brought strong and gusty winds across England - bringing down several trees in one city.

A busy main road in Nottingham was closed for two hours when a large tree blew down and blocked it, causing bus services to be diverted.
High winds also blew down a tree at a school on the outskirts of the city.
The Met Office said gusts as high as 47mph had been recorded at Sutton Bonington in Nottinghamshire.
Dorcas Sukami was on a bus in Nottingham when a tree fell down blocking Hucknall Road at about 15:45 GMT.
"I'm actually really surprised nobody got hurt because the way that the tree fell it covered the whole of the middle of Hucknall Road," she said.
"A couple of the bus drivers were being held up and there was a lot of commotion."
A tree blew down at Woodborough Woods Primary School as parents were picking their children up, but no-one is believed to have been injured.
Highways England has advised people that driving in windy weather can be hazardous, and people should be particularly aware in northern parts of England.
Several roads have been closed for safety to high-sided and vulnerable vehicles, and drivers are being advised to plan ahead and allow plenty of extra travel time.
