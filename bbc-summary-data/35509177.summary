[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 0-0 Birmingham City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rotherham United ended with nine men as Neil Warnock's first game in charge of the Millers finished goalless against Birmingham City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Wood was dismissed for fouling Clayton Donaldson, while Joe Mattock saw red for time-wasting.
Jacques Maghoma almost put Blues ahead from range but striker Donaldson failed to latch on to his wide shot.
For the hosts, Kirk Broadfoot headed Joe Newell's corner wide before Tomasz Kuszczak saved Matt Derbyshire's shot.
The result means Rotherham remain in 22nd place in the Championship and five points adrift of safety, while Birmingham rise a place to seventh and are three points from a play-off spot.
Warnock, who had been without a managerial role since a four-game spell as temporary boss of Queens Park Rangers late in 2015, was appointed Rotherham United manager until the end of the season following Neil Redfearn's dismissal.
The new Millers boss has not lost in his first game in charge of a club since losing 2-1 to Bradford City as manager of Oldham Athletic in February 1997.
Rotherham manager Neil Warnock:
"I thought they were excellent and on another day, we could have took the points but it wasn't to be.
"In the situation we are in we just have to make sure we get 100 percent out of the players and that's what they did today.
"The lads fought to the end, I have nothing but praise for them. They can only do what they did, we need more points.
"We have to win games we are not expected to. It'll be good to see what these lads can do."
Birmingham manager Gary Rowett:

"You always know it is going to be difficult to prepare for a game when a team changes manager close to the game. It did affect our preparations.
"In the sense that we have not done enough to win the game in the final third, it was a fair result.
"The players are disappointed, they look like they have lost the game and then you read the results and we have actually clawed a point back and we are only three points off the top six.
"So we can't be too displeased with a draw away from home and a clean sheet."
