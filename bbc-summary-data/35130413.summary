The 23-year-old is also British and European champion going into Rio 2016, when para-triathlon will make its Paralympics debut.
"I didn't ever believe I'd have such an achievement, but everyone trains as equally as hard so I can't sit back and relax," she told BBC Look East.
"I just get it in my head that the rest of the world is chasing me."
Peterborough-born Steadman continued: "If that's not enough then I don't know what is."
She competed at the London 2012 and Beijing 2008 Olympics as a swimmer, but since 2013 has won three European and two World titles in para-triathlon.
"To stand here undefeated for 14 months feels like a phenomenal achievement; I never dreamed of being so successful," said Steadman, who is currently training in Portsmouth.
"But with having the other titles, to have one more, especially as para-tri makes its debut, it would be fantastic, my name would go down in history and I shall definitely give it my best shot.
"But I've got some fierce rivals, so I'm not going to say anything until I cross that line."
