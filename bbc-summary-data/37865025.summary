Ireland v New Zealand: Rob Kearney named at full-back for Chicago game

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rob Kearney plays at full-back in an experienced Ireland team to take on New Zealand in Saturday's Test in Chicago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Leinster player missed the summer tour to South Africa through injury and Jared Payne deputised in the number 15 shirt during his absence.
Payne renews his midfield partnership with Robbie Henshaw against the All Blacks, with Simon Zebo on the wing.
Prop Tadhg Furlong makes his second international start while Donnacha Ryan joins Devin Toner in the second row.
Munster lock Ryan gets the nod ahead of Connacht's Ultan Dillane, who is named among the replacements.
Zebo and Johnny Sexton are recalled after being ruled out of the summer tour, which Ireland lost 2-1 after winning the first match of the series in Cape Town.
Toner starts his 11th successive Test match in the second row while Jordi Murphy hangs on to the number seven shirt as coach Joe Schmidt retains the back row that started against the Springboks in the first and third Tests in June.
CJ Stander is named at blind-side flanker and Murphy at open-side, while Jamie Heaslip starts his 16th Test in a row, having played a full 80 minutes in Ireland's last 11 games.
In the front row, Furlong is chosen alongside Jack McGrath and skipper Rory Best, who is set to win his 98th cap.
Centre Garry Ringrose could make his Test debut from the bench, where he is joined by fellow uncapped Leinster player Joey Carbery.
Carbery, 21, comes in as cover for Sexton while Kieran Marmion is preferred to Luke McGrath as substitute scrum-half.
Connacht prop Finlay Bealham has overcome a concussion sustained as a replacement in the Pro12 defeat by Leinster in time to take his place on the bench.
Ireland have never beaten the All Blacks, who extended their winning streak to a record 18 matches by recently beating Australia 37-10.
