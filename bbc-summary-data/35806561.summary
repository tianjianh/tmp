FA Cup: Everton to face Man Utd or West Ham in semi-finals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Everton will face either Manchester United or West Ham in the FA Cup semi-finals, while Crystal Palace will take on Watford in the last four.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ties will be played on the weekend of April 23-24 at Wembley.
Manchester United will travel to Upton Park for a quarter-final replay after the sides drew 1-1 at Old Trafford.
The date of that last-eight replay will be announced after the second leg of United's Europa League last-16 tie against Liverpool on Thursday.
The winner of that match will face an Everton team who beat Chelsea 2-0 on Saturday to reach the last four for the first time since 2012.
The other semi-final is a repeat of the 2013 Championship play-off final, which Palace won thanks to a Kevin Phillips penalty.
Watford, who knocked out holders Arsenal on Sunday, will attempt to reach the final for the first time since 1984, while Palace are through to their first FA Cup semi-final in 21 years.
