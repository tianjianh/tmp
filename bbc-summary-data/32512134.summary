Claire Waxman was stalked for 12 years by Elliot Fogel, 40, from Edgware in north London. He was jailed on Tuesday for breaching a restraining order.
Despite the order, he had used the civil courts to continue to harass her by claiming defamation over comments she had made in media interviews.
Ms Waxman said criminal and civil courts must work more closely to prevent this tactic.
