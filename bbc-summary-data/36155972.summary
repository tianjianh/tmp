Heavyweight world champion Fury fights Klitschko again on 9 July, having beaten the Ukrainian in November.
"I'm not accepted in Britain because I'm a Gypsy and that will never change," said Fury, 27.
The WBA and WBO title-holder added: "The Klitschko fight will be my last in Britain. Get past him and I'm away."
Manchester fighter Fury has previously spoken about the online abuse he receives for being part of the Traveller community.
"This country has been waiting for me for 120 years but when I finally arrived, people called me a bum," he said. "So I'm moving to America, where champions are appreciated.
"I made the decision last week to move to Los Angeles, where they admire success and big talking. I was made for America.
"I'm going to where millionaires are welcome - and I'm a millionaire now.

"Every Brit that wants to make it in life has to go to America. If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere."
Fury, who is undefeated in 25 professional fights, stunned the boxing world by outpointing Klitschko, who had not been beaten for 11 years, in Dusseldorf.
But his comments on homosexuality, paedophilia and women saw more than 100,000 people sign an online petition in an attempt to get him removed from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.
Fury apologised at the award ceremony last December.
