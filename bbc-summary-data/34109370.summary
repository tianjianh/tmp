[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eleven planned court closures will "erode access to justice" in Wales, the Law Society has warned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The UK government is consulting on plans to shut 91 courts and tribunals in England and Wales.
Law Society president Jonathan Smithers said it had "grave concerns" about the proposals which would mean people would have to travel elsewhere.
The government has said if the plans go ahead, 95% of people could drive to another court in an hour.
Carmarthenshire council met on Tuesday to discuss the implications should Carmarthen Law Courts shut.
Carmarthen Civil, Family, Tribunal and Probate Hearing Centre is also earmarked for closure.
Council leader Emlyn Dole said the rural nature of Carmarthenshire would make it "impossible" for some to reach hearings transferred to Swansea and Llanelli.
Mr Smithers said the society was collating solicitors' views on the plans and their impact in order to respond to the government consultation which ends on 8 October.
