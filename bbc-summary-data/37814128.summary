[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Katrin Omarsdottir struck the only goal following a free-kick midway through the second half to give the Belles their only points of the season.
Emma Follis fired wide early on for Reading, while Belles' Emily Simpkins' 25-yard shot was saved by Mary Earps.
Christie Murray almost grabbed a second but Earps kept out her header.
Doncaster captain Leandra Little:
"Seeing the goal go in was just an absolute massive, massive relief. Also, it is just nice to be celebrating something.
"To get together with the girls and celebrate and finish the season on a high is good.
"It has been a tough season and we've put in a lot of part performances and had to weather storms for part of games.
"We also knew today was our last chance to get something. We didn't want to go down with no points on the board and we said that we'd put our bodies on the line and go for it."
