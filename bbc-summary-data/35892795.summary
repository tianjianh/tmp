The depiction of Leasowe Man, named after the Merseyside town where he was found in 1864, is on show at the Museum of Liverpool.
It said the image "raises lots of questions... about his life".
Curator Liz Stewart said they were unable to ascertain his hair and eye colours but it was "most likely" he had the tones shown in the picture.
The image of "Merseyside's oldest skeleton" was created by researchers at Liverpool John Moores University's Face Lab, which conducts archaeological and forensic work.
Radiocarbon dating has previously found that the skeleton, now on display at the Natural History Museum in London,  is between 1,600 and 1,900 years old.

Analysis also shows that Leasowe Man was about 40 years old at the time of his death, and was about 5ft 6in (1.7m) tall.
His bones "showed signs of strong muscle attachments, suggesting he was physically active during his life," Ms Stewart said.
Despite Leasowe's location on the Merseyside coast, she said chemical analysis revealed that he "didn't eat very much fish, which is a little surprising for someone found so close to the sea"
