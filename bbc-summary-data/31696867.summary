The inaugural "Leg it with Eric" race will celebrate the return of the late comedian's statue to Morecambe after it was vandalised last year.
Councillor Ron Sands said it "made us all sit up and galvanised the spirit of the people of Morecambe to just how important Eric is".
Runners are urged to wear "Eric-style" glasses for the 3km (1.86-mile) event.
Born John Eric Bartholomew, Morecambe formed a much-loved double act with Ernie Wise on stage and television.
Their Christmas specials were a highlight of the festive period, attracting more than 27 million viewers in 1977.
Morecambe died in 1984 after collapsing on stage with a heart attack shortly after his 58th birthday.
His comedy partner died in 1999, a few months before Morecambe's statue was officially unveiled by the Queen.
Red Nose Day takes place on 13 March, a day before the "Leg it with Eric" run, which has been organised by Lancaster City Council with Lancaster and Morecambe Athletics Club.
