[SN]TITLE[SN]
Grandson murder accused Stewart Greene 'angry with daughter'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of murdering of his grandson has admitted he killed the boy because he was angry with the nine-year-old's mother.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stewart Greene, 65, of Grimoldby, Lincolnshire, said he drowned Alex Robinson in a bath but denies murder.
Alex was in Mr Greene's care at his home while his mother - the defendant's daughter was out - last December.
Mr Greene, who took the witness stand for the first time at Lincoln Crown Court, also apologised to his family.
Timothy Spencer QC, defending, asked Mr Greene whether he had drowned his grandson, to which he replied "I drowned him in the bath, yes."
He also told the court he had had a "burning sensation" in his head on the day he killed Alex.
He later apologised to his daughter, saying: "I'm so sorry Joanne."
Mr Spencer asked him if he had been hearing voices, to which he said: "no, there were no voices, I've lived in a dream world all my life."
It was put to Mr Greene "the prosecution say you are not mentally ill at all", to which he replied: "the prosecution are right".
The court had previously been told Mr Greene had suffered from depression and had been discharged from a Lincoln-based psychiatric unit.
Prosecutor Michael Evans QC put it to Mr Greene he told a psychiatrist, in October, that "you killed your grandson as you were angry with your daughter that she would not let you live with her".
"Is that why you killed him?" said Mr Evans. "Yes," Mr Greene replied.
He told the jury Alex had done nothing wrong and he himself had been guilty of being selfish all his life.
The court also heard how he had thought about killing Alex the evening before the boy drowned.
The trial continues.
