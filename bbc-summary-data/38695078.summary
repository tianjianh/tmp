Barack Obama has asked the public to suggest what he should do once he steps down as president of the United States.

In a video released on social media on Friday, he joined his wife, Michelle, and said they wanted ideas for the new presidential centre they will set up in Chicago.
Mr Obama called it a "living, working centre for citizenship".
However, Mrs Obama said their first priority would be to get some sleep.
The project will be based in the couple's old neighbourhood, South Side, but they said it will have projects all over the city, the country and the world.
They called for the public to send in their ideas, hopes, beliefs and inspirations via the website Obama.org.
After eight years in the White House, Mr Obama is handing over to the next US president, Donald Trump, in Friday's inauguration ceremony at the US Capitol in Washington DC.
With his wife, he thanked the public for their support, as the couple found themselves on the cusp of rejoining the world as public citizens. The family are moving to the Washington neighbourhood of Kalorama.
"This will be your presidential centre as much as it is ours," said Mrs Obama.
Mr Obama added that true democracy was a project much bigger than any one person.
In his final press conference on Wednesday, he had confirmed that he would not be running for another public post "anytime soon".
"I want to do some writing. I want to be quiet a little bit and not hear myself talk so darn much. I want to spend precious time with my girls," he said. "Those are my priorities this year."
In interviews, the Democrat had previously said he wanted to help nurture the next generation of his party's leaders - and ideally run an NBA basketball team.
He has also allegedly joked about getting a job at music-streaming site Spotify, as he was well known for curating and sharing his own playlists.
