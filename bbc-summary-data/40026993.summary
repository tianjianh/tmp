County Championship: Leicestershire pile up the runs on day one at Derby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colin Ackermann and Mark Cosgrove both made hundreds as Leicestershire dominated day one of their County Championship match against Derbyshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ackermann reached his first century for Leicestershire off 149 balls before falling for 118 to Jeevan Mendis.
Captain Cosgrove went on to make his 34th first-class hundred and reached stumps on 137 not out.
Ned Eckersley added an unbeaten 77 off 69 balls in the final session as the visitors closed on 415-3.
Eckersley and Cosgrove punished a tiring Derbyshire attack, putting on 139 in just under 20 overs, after Ackermann had shared a third-wicket stand of 175 with the skipper.
Cosgrove, who passed 13,000 first-class runs in an innings which has contained 22 boundaries so far, is yet to lead his side to a Championship victory this season while Derbyshire are also winless.
