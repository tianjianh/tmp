Det Insp John Kavanagh said:  "This was a distressing incident for the victim. We are eager to trace this suspect as a matter of urgency.
"Anyone who saw a male matching the suspect description in the Buchanan Street area yesterday, or has any other relevant information, is asked to contact police immediately."
