Dirty Dancing star Jennifer Grey is to guest judge on Strictly Come Dancing next month.

The 51-year-old actress will replace Len Goodman for a week while the head judge takes a break.
Grey won Dancing with the Stars - the US version of the celebrity dance show, on which Goodman also judges - last year with her partner Derek Hough.
She will join fellow judges Craig Revel Horwood, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli on the panel on 5 and 6 November.
"I so look forward to making the pilgrimage to the birthplace of the greatest dance show, the mecca of spray tans and tangos, and to sit in for the great and pernickety Len Goodman," Grey is quoted as saying.
Goodman films Strictly and its US counterpart concurrently, with Dancing with the Stars airing live on Monday and Tuesday straight after the judge finishes his duties with the UK show.
Fellow judge Tonioli also sits on the US judging panel, alongside US choreographer Carrie Ann Inaba.
"Flying back and forth between London and LA doing the two shows is very gruelling, so this year the BBC have kindly agreed to give me a week off to rest," Goodman said.
A BBC spokesman added: "It was always agreed that Len would take a week off from Strictly due to his commitments with Dancing with the Stars."
Goodman will return to the UK judging panel from 12 November.
Grey remains best known for her role as Frances 'Baby' Houseman in 1987's Dirty Dancing, in which she appeared with the late Patrick Swayze.
