Lady Colin, 66, her son Dima, and their dog escaped unharmed from the collision near her home at Goring Castle on the A27 near Clapham, West Sussex.
Police, ambulance and the fire service went to the crash, which damaged the driver's side of her Audi estate.
Sussex Police said no-one was injured in the crash on Friday.
The passenger side of another Audi A3 caved in and the bonnet was smashed.
Lady C said she was concerned about the speed of traffic on the dual carriageway in front of her castle, near Worthing.
"The only thing that will prevent a similar incident in the future is the installation of a speed camera," she said.
"This time we were all very lucky that no-one was killed or hurt - next time people might not be so fortunate."
Sussex Police said emergency services were called to the crash at 16:15 BST.
"Diversions were in place while the vehicles, two Audis and a Ford, were recovered and the scene was made safe," said a spokesman.
Lady C is filming a new reality TV show at her home called The Lady in the Castle.
She left the last series of I'm A Celebrity early on medical grounds.
Former Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison was crowned Queen of the Jungle.
