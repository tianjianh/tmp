[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Henri Lansbury grabbed a hat-trick for Nottingham Forest as they won at Barnsley, who finished with 10 men.

Sam Winnall and Marley Watkins twice put the Tykes ahead, but Lansbury and Apostolos Vellios both levelled for Forest in the opening 24 minutes.
Lansbury headed Forest ahead in first-half stoppage time and Ben Osborn nodded in to make it 4-2.
After Watkins was sent off for an apparent stamp on Forest's Thomas Lam, Lansbury's penalty wrapped up the win.
Forest's second successive victory on the road was all the more remarkable given that they had not won away from home in the Championship this season before beating Ipswich 2-0 last weekend, and were without striker Britt Assombalonga - who scored both goals at Portman Road - because of a hamstring injury.
Defeat leaves Barnsley, who slip below Forest in the table on goals scored, without a win in seven games at Oakwell, after starting the season with three successive home wins.
But Paul Heckingbottom's side could have hardly made a better start as Winnall headed in James Bree's pinpoint cross.
Three more goals followed in a breathless opening quarter as Lansbury levelled with a 25-yard free-kick, only for Watkins to immediately beat the offside trap to stroke Barnsley back in front before Vellios scrambled in Danny Fox's low centre from the left.
Lansbury headed in Osborn's cross to put Forest in front for the first time just before the break, and Osborn added a fourth from Michael Mancienne's cross.
Watkins was then shown a straight red card for his clash with Lam, before Lansbury completed his hat-trick after substitute Matty Cash was brought down by Josh Scowan.
Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom told BBC Radio Sheffield:
"In my opinion we've gifted them goals and when you do that you've got no chance of winning a game. You can forgot all the positives that you're doing well because we were nowhere near in terms of doing the fundamentals.
"Forest will go away thinking it's a great away performance but we've gifted them three points."
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"We started badly, I was angry about the first 20 minutes because defensively we lost a lot of duels.
"After that we had a good reaction and were efficient offensively - five goals away from home is rare.
"The second half was better defensively, and with the ball we were able to control more of the game and attacked quickly.
"Henri always shows a good mentality and he sets the example for the young players and everyone. I enjoyed that he scored three goals. It is his first hat-trick and I hope not the last."
