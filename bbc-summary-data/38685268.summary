[SN]TITLE[SN]
Church in Wales' first woman bishop consecrated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Church in Wales' first woman bishop was consecrated at a ceremony in Cardiff on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Canon Joanna Penberthy was consecrated as Bishop of St Davids at Llandaff Cathedral at 11:00 GMT.
She was elected to the position by members of the Electoral College in November.
The 56-year-old said being made bishop was "awe inspiring" while the Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan described it as a "historic occasion".
Canon Penberthy, who was appointed the cathedral's first woman canon in 2007, took over the role from Wyn Evans.
The decision to allow women bishops was made following a vote in 2013.
Canon Penberthy, who was previously Rector of Glan Ithon, in the diocese of Swansea and Brecon, said: "While being made bishop is awe inspiring, I am very much looking forward to joining the people of St Davids diocese as we seek to live out and share our faith in the risen Christ."
She has previously spoken out about the discrimination she faced but said she could accept not everybody would be happy with her appointment.
Dr Morgan, who carried out the consecration, said the women clergy in Wales had faced a "long struggle" to get to this point.
He said: "The great thing about our women clergy is that they did not give up or become cynical or bitter.
"They dared to trust and dared to hope and so are part of a long and distinguished company of people in the Old and New Testaments who trusted in God's promises and hoped against hope that all would be well."
He added: "What matters is not gender but suitability, character, gifts and that was why Joanna was elected as bishop."
Canon Penberthy will be enthroned at St Davids Cathedral on 11 February.
