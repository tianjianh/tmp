[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Borders Council technology department decision delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for the future of the information and communications technology department at Scottish Borders Council have been delayed by two months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It had been hoped full proposals could be tabled in October but they will now come just before Christmas.
There have been concerns they could see 80 jobs transferred to an outside company in a joint arrangement with the City of Edinburgh Council.
The Unite union has criticised any attempt to move the posts.
A report to the local authority said plans for the department would not meet the originally intended deadline of 8 October.
Instead, they will be presented on 17 December.
The delay has been attributed to the time needed to analyse the cost implications of any switch.
