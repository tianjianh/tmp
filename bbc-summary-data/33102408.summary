Hoey, 36, was two shots inside the cut mark of level par after his three-under-par round.
The Northern Irishman shares 31st place at the halfway stage although he is 10 behind leader Gregory Bourdy with Peter Lawrie the best Irishman on five under.
Hoey produced four birdies and a single bogey in a steady round at Atzenbrugg.
Galgorm Castle touring professional and five-time European Tour winner Hoey is currently only 122nd in the Race to Dubai standings.
Maybin lost his European Tour card at the end of last season and will almost certainly drop down further in the Race to Dubai from his current 209th spot.
The Ballyclare man has been handed a number of starts on the main tour this season but has struggle to make an impact.
Simon Thornton squeezed into the final two rounds on the cut mark of level after a 74.
After starting at the 10th, the county Down-based player was two under par after 15 holes but a double bogey at the seventh meant that he needed to par the closing two holes to progress to the weekend action.
Kevin Phelan missed the cut after a 75 left him on five over while Damien McGrane exited on 10 over after a second successive 77.
Frenchman Bourdy added a 67 to his his impressive 65 which left him four ahead of Chris Wood and Gary Stal.
Lawrie is sharing eighth place on five under after a 71 on Friday.
