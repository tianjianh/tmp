Sandra Brotherton killing: Son admits 'frenzied' stab attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted stabbing his mother to death in a "frenzied attack" at their home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandra Brotherton was found dead by relatives at the house in Redwood Drive in Bredbury, Stockport, on New Year's Eve in 2014.
A post-mortem examination found the 60-year-old died from blood loss as a result of multiple stab wounds.
Her son David, 30, was sentenced to an indefinite hospital order at Manchester Crown Court.
He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
Senior investigating officer Duncan Thorpe said Brotherton had "a history of mental health problems" and was "clearly not well" when he attacked his mother.
He said the death had "devastated a family [who] have had to come to terms with the shock and distress of losing Sandra".
