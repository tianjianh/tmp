Total Fitness to reopen in Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 40 jobs are expected to be created when a gym, which closed suddenly in 2011, reopens after a Â£1m refit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Total Fitness bosses say they were sorry difficulties over a lease caused them to leave the building on Stansty Road.
But now they are working on reopening the facilities in April, complete with new equipment.
Facilities include three pools, a family workout area and a cafe.
