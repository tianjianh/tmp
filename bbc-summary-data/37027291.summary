Sheffield cake shop told to repaint union jack frontage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cake shop in Sheffield has been told to remove a union jack painted on its frontage because it breaches planning regulations.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sheffield Council said the Cake 'R' Us store, on Devonshire Street, was part of a Grade II-listed building and no consent was gained before painting.
A formal enforcement notice would soon be served, a council spokesman said.
Owner David Chan could not be reached for comment, but previously said it was painted in an "act of national pride".
A complaint about the shop, which is in part of the former Wharncliffe Fireclay Works built for John Armitage in 1888, was received in January 2015.
The council said the front of the store should be repainted "in a colour scheme that is more in keeping with the original 19th Century characteristics of the building".
Councillor Mazher Iqbal, cabinet member for transport and infrastructure, said: "The tenant has yet to submit a formal application suggesting a suitable alternative frontage for the building, but, if he does, we will work with him to develop his proposal to an acceptable standard."
Speaking in April, Mr Chan said he would "write to the Queen" if the council took legal action, as he did not "see anything wrong with it".
