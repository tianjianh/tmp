Belfast City Airport's 2m seat sale limit to be lifted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planning restriction which limits the number of departure seats sold by George Best Belfast City Airport is set to be lifted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The decision, by Infrastructure Minister Chris Hazzard, was revealed in a letter to Finance Minister MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã“ Muilleoir and seen by residents groups.
It follows a public inquiry into the issue in 2015.
The airport has argued that dropping the 2m seats cap would help moves to attract more European flights.
The restriction will be replaced by new noise controls, recommended at the inquiry.
In his letter, Mr Hazzard said his decision is subject to "resolving technical issues".
Belfast City Airport Watch, which represents residents, had fought for the restriction to remain in place, fearing a busier, noisier airport.
Liz Fawcett said the group would have preferred that there was no relaxation of noises controls at Belfast City Airport.
"The commission clearly tried to strike a balance between the commercial interests of the airport and the health and quality of life of the tens of thousands of local residents affected by the issue," she said.
"We can be confident that we won't have to suffer the extreme levels of noise which could have occurred, had the airport been given everything which it was seeking."
More than 2.5m passenger use the airport annually - a figure representing both departing and incoming travellers.
The airport - which was recently agreed for sale - did not comment on Mr Hazzard's decision.
