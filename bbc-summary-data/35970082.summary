The jury in the trial of a mother and stepfather jointly accused of stamping a toddler to death retires to consider its verdict.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Rigby, 22, and 23-year-old Kathryn Smith deny murdering Ayeeshia Jane Smith at their home in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, in May 2014.
Birmingham Crown Court heard Ayeeshia had a heart injury usually seen in people who have fallen off buildings or been in a car crash.
She died from a fatal heart laceration.
During the trial Ms Smith, of Sandfield Road in Nottingham, described her daughter as "an angel", and said Ayeeshia had suffered bruises when falling off her potty.
Mr Rigby, of Sloan Drive in Nottingham, had admitted his relationship with her mother, which has now ended, was volatile, with police often being called to their flat in Burton upon Trent, but denied injuring Ayeeshia.
The former couple both confirmed they used cannabis at least three times a week, with the drug found stored in a Tommee Tippee mug at their flat.
