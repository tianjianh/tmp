Glasgow Warriors are set to play on an artificial surface next season after the city's council approved a Â£750,000 upgrade of the Scotstoun Stadium.

Work at the council-owned stadium will start this month with the laying of an all-weather synthetic pitch in time to host Warriors home games for 2016-17.
There will also be improvements to the 400m outdoor running track.
And the adjacent training pitch will be upgraded to provide a new throws area compliant for field events.
Heavy rainfall forced Warriors to postpone four games last season as the pitch failed to cope.
The club staged three of those rearranged fixtures at Kilmarnock Football Club's Rugby Park and, after being impressed by the 4G surface laid there, Glasgow were keen to have their own.
Fellow Pro12 side Cardiff Blues have an artificial surface, as do English Premiership clubs Saracens and Newcastle Falcons.
Managing director Nathan Bombrys told Glasgow Warriors' website: "A lot of work has gone on behind the scenes over the last few months, culminating in today's announcement and this is fantastic news for everyone who uses the stadium.
"From next season we'll have an excellent surface all year round, to play the exciting brand of rugby we enjoy.
"It will also provide us with exciting opportunities, which will help us grow the club and the game in the west of Scotland.
"We have visited a number of clubs who have similar surfaces, which they either play or train on and we believe an artificial surface is the best solution for Scotstoun Stadium.
"We'd like to thank Scottish Rugby, Glasgow City Council and sportscotland for funding this project."
