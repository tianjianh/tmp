[SN]TITLE[SN]
Berwick Rangers 3-0 Clyde

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blair Henderson took his season's tally to 17 with two goals as Berwick Rangers eased to victory against Clyde.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Berwick took the lead against the run of play, a great cross from Callum Crane glanced home by Henderson.
Clyde almost levelled before the break, but David Marsh rattled the crossbar.
Henderson scored a scruffy second with five minutes remaining and there was time for Jordan McGregor to lift the ball over the goalkeeper for a third after a neat attacking move.
