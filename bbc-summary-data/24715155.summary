Many of the figures, including Han Solo, Jabba the Hutt, Princess Leia and Ewoks, were still in their original packaging.
Also in the sale at Duke's Auctioneers in Dorchester were "life-size" figures of Yoda, a Jawa and a lightsaber.
Auctioneer Matthew Denney said the items sold to about 30 buyers located around the country.
He said about 50% of the collection had been sold to people in Dorset.
The collection was assembled over many years by a Star Wars enthusiast and the items related to all six movies, with an emphasis on the three original films, Mr Denney said.
The items were divided into 50 lots, with a Han Solo in carbonate figure fetching the highest price of £1,000.
Some of the toys were manufactured in the 1970s by firms such as Kenner and Palitoy.
Before the auction Mr Denney said: "Some of the early items such as the Kenner manufactured model of the 'Land Speeder' are now rare, especially when they are in their original packaging.
"This sale is sure to leave some of us thinking 'if only we had kept our toys nicely in their boxes …..'."
