The Old Bailey heard police found 83 home-made sex videos on Mr Port's mobile phone.

Det Sgt Mick McInerney, who presented the evidence to the court, told jurors the same 24-year-old appears in all six videos, which were recorded between January and June last year.
Some of the videos featured other unidentified participants, the court heard.
Port, who watched intently from the dock, denies two sample counts of rape relating to two of the videos.
Mr Port, who worked as a chef, is on trial accused of murdering four young men by giving them fatal doses of date rape drug GHB over a 15-month period.
He is also accused of drugging and raping other young men he met through dating websites and lured to his one-bedroom flat in Barking, east London.
He denies 29 charges including four counts of murder, as well as drugging, rape and sexual assault.
