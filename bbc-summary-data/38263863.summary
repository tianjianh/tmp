Mumtaz Member, 56, died from head injuries at her home in Holmfield Avenue, Leicester, on 12 December 2015.
Her sons - Mohammed Member and Shafiq Member - together with Shafiq's partner Fatima Patel were charged with murder but the charges were later dropped.
Police believe there are people with information who have not come forward.
They have also released CCTV images of potential witnesses who were in Holmfield Avenue on the night of 11 December and early hours of 12 December.
Det Ch Insp Mick Graham from the East Midlands Major Crime Unit said it was "a rather brutal case" and it was important to get justice for Mrs Member.
He said: "Sadly we are 12 months down the line and we are still looking at all lines of inquiry.
"We are seeking support and information from the community because I think the answer is in the local community.
"There are people that know key information who feel they can't come forward."
Det Ch Insp Graham said Mrs Member was killed in a bedroom at her home between midnight and 09:30 GMT. She was found by a family member.
He said: "I don't want people to forget that Mumtaz was a loving mother, grandmother, sister and wife, and this has devastated the family."
The Leicester Mercury said Mrs Mumtaz's family is well known in the business community which "reacted with shock" to the death.
The reward is being offered to people who contact Crimestoppers directly with information which leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
