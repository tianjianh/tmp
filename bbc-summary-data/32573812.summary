Election 2015: #EdStone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The #EdStone has drawn much comment, a fair amount of photoshopping, the odd Moses reference and more than a few comparisons with BBC political drama The Thick of It as the Labour Party leader unveiled his election promises on a rather large stone this morning...

People poked fun at what seemed an unusual choice for presenting his promises...
And the Moses jokes keep on coming...
People also speculated on what might happen to it after the election...
Photoshoppers were out in force to offer alternatives #Edstones, some more political than others...
And it wasn't just social media that had something to say about it...
There's been no official Twitter response from the Labour Party or Ed himself yet on the #EdStone but he did say in a Q&A: "I'm going to leave the landscape gardening part of this to other people. I don't measure the curtains or the gardens... but what I am determined to do - and this is the big difference between me and David Cameron - is that I'm not going to put an expiry date on my promises marked 8 May."
When asked what he thought of it David Cameron remarked "If you've got a problem with judgement ... I don't think that's going to help"
Responding to Ed Miliband's latest gimmick, William Hague said: "This is yet more evidence that Ed Miliband is simply not up to the job of being Prime Minister. And if he does make it to No. 10, Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP will take their chisels to Miliband's vanity stone and write their own demands all over it."
