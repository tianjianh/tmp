He'll also bring out his own magazine alongside it in July.
The singer-songwriter made the announcement on his website, but so far there's no confirmation of titles.
The musician posted a picture of himself with a magazine called Boys Don't Cry on his Tumblr page, with the caption: "I got two versions. I got twoooo versions."
On the singer's website he added the "#ISSUE1", "#ALBUM3", "#JULY2015" and "#BOYSDONTCRY".
It's been three years since Ocean released the award-winning album Channel Orange.
In November, the 27-year-old posted a track called Memrise on his Tumblr account.
He signed a new management deal with Three Six Zero last year and has been working with Hit-Boy and Rodney Jerkins on new material.
