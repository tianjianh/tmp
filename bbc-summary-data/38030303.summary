A centre housing the world's largest interactive digital screens for learning about science and technology could be heading to Swansea.

The idea is based on The Cube in Brisbane, Australia, which has 48 multi-touch screens across two storeys.
Dinosaurs, physics and data relevant to the local area are among the subjects visitors can interactively explore.
A Swansea version would go on the civic centre site and form part of the city centre's Â£500m regeneration.
It is being explored between Swansea council, Swansea University and site developers Trebor.
This site would also include a national public aquarium, an aquatic science research facility and a science gallery.
"The Cube at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane has been phenomenally successful, bringing science to life by using 21st Century interactive, unlimited multi-touch technology for the benefit of local schools, communities and visitors," said council leader Rob Stewart.
"We're exploring the potential to introduce something similar on the seafront in Swansea.
"This proposal would attract many thousands of visitors, open up jobs, benefit Swansea residents of all ages, and help keep talented Swansea University graduates in Swansea."
Swansea University's Prof Chris Allton said: "The university's fascinating research into marine life, climate change, computer technology and a host of other activities could be explored by using innovative, ground-breaking technology like that developed in The Cube. The opportunities are endless."
The other part of the city centre regeneration has gone out to public consultation.
Residents are being asked to give their views on the St David's site which has been renamed Swansea Central.
It will include a digital arena, cinema, cafes, restaurants, shops, a hotel and apartments.
A public exhibition took place in the city centre at the weekend.
