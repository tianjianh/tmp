The Holy Trinity fighter had a 3-2 majority win against the World and European light-welterweight title holder to reach the quarter-finals.
Monday's victory also secured his place at the World Championships in Hamburg, Germany in August.
Belfast flyweight Brendan Irvine is also through to the quarter-finals.
The Rio Olympian beat Turkish opponent Bathuhan Citfci on a unanimous 5-0 decision to advance to the last eight, the victory also securing his place at the World Championships.
McComb, who easily dealt with Czech Erik Agateljan in his 64kg opener, had previously defeated the top-ranked Russian at a multi-nation tournament in Dublin in April.
However this victory is much more significant, the fighter tweeting "nothing won yet, I'll just keep trucking" after his great win in Kharkiv.
He now meets England's Luke McCormack in the quarter-finals.
