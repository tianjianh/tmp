During a visit to Glasgow, Labour's Treasury spokesman Ed Balls will say Labour's first budget would end "Tory austerity".
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg will also be in Scotland to outline his plans to triple paternity leave.
The SNP will vow to cut VAT for emergency services and the Scottish Conservatives will focus on justice.
Elsewhere, the Scottish Greens will renew their election pledge to bring the railways back in to public ownership.
Voters across the UK go to the polls on 7 May.
On day three of the campaign Mr Balls is expected to say a vote for the SNP is a vote for continued Tory cuts. He said Labour would invest in the NHS, education and jobs in Scotland.
He will say: "Our tough but balanced plan, set out in our fiscal pledge, means we won't do this by increasing borrowing but with fair tax changes across the UK."
Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats will pledge to increase paternity leave from two weeks to six.
Mr Clegg will say: "For too long, mums have been told their place is at home with their child, while dads return to work.
"I want parents to choose for themselves how to balance work and family."
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson will campaign in Edinburgh for the SNP, calling for a change to VAT rules for emergency services.
Speaking ahead of the event, he said: "At a time when public services are being hammered by unprecedented Westminster budget cuts, it beggars belief that the UK government won't grant Scotland's police and fire services this vital VAT exception.
"Reversing these unfair rules would free up Â£23 million for police and Â£10 million for fire services - and this money could be invested in frontline staff."
Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson will give a speech at the Scottish Police Federation Conference on law and order.
She is expected to say her party would end automatic early release, reintroduce life imprisonment for the most serious crimes, and make those who break a community payback order spend a night in jail.
At an event at Stirling railway station, the Scottish Greens will make their vow to bring the railways back into public ownership once current contracts expire.
It comes as the Dutch, state-owned company Abellio takes over the ScotRail franchise. UK law currently prevents public sector bids for rail franchises.
Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone, said: "Greens believe that the infrastructure arteries of our economy should be publicly-owned as default, so we'll continue the fight to change the law that prevents this."
