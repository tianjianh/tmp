Caixinha arrived in Glasgow on a flight from Lisbon as he moves closer to adding the two new signings ahead of pre-season training.
Defender Cardoso, 23, signed a four-year deal with Primeira Liga outfit Vitoria de Setubal last year.
Benfica forward Dalcio, 21, is expected to sign on loan for the Ibrox side.
Cardoso joined Benfica as a youth player and developed with their 'B' team before a loan spell at Pacos Ferreira and a permanent switch to Vitoria. He played for the Portugal youth team up to Under-20 level.
Dalcio, meanwhile, made his breakthrough at Belenenses before moving to Benfica's 'B' team.
Caixinha has already added 35-year-old defender Bruno Alves and former Aberdeen captain Ryan Jack to his squad, while Mexican midfielder Carlos Pena arrived in Glasgow last week for talks.
Rangers begin their Europa League campaign on 29 June.
