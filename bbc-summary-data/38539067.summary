Birmingham City 0-0 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham's  winless run under new boss Gianfranco Zola stretched to six matches as they were held to a goalless draw at home by Nottingham Forest.

Chances were few and far between in a poor Championship game at St Andrew's, as Forest failed to land a single effort on target, while Blues only had three.
Forest's 1,474 away fans kept up their protests at owner Fawaz Al Hasawi.
But the point for the up-for-sale club ended a run of five straight defeats.
Forest have not won in eight games, however, since beating leaders Newcastle on 2 December - and head coach Philippe Montanier's future remains uncertain.
The proposed takeover by a United States-based consortium led by John Jay Moores collapsed on Friday, according to Fawaz, although the club have been allowed to come out of their transfer embargo.
Not even the return of midweek signing Craig Gardner for his first Birmingham appearance in five and a half years could help muster a goal.
Gardner had scored on his previous Blues appearance, the day they were relegated from the Premier League in a 2-1 defeat at Tottenham on 22 May 2011.
But after completing his loan move back to St Andrew's from neighbours West Bromwich Albion, his appearance as a 54th-minute substitute for Maikel Kieftenbeld was the highlight of the day for the home fans.
Although Forest had to survive a 30-minute spell of intense second-half pressure, the visitors kept a clean sheet for only the second time this season, thanks to saves by goalkeeper Stephen Henderson from Che Adams, Kieftenbeld and a Lukas Jutkiewicz header.
With uncertainty over his future, Henri Lansbury was again left out, Forest's rivals Derby County, Blues' neighbours Aston Villa and Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic having all been linked with a move for the midfielder.
Birmingham City manager Gianfranco Zola:
"In the first half we kept the ball too much in front of our defenders but, saying that, Forest defended in depth and did not allow us to find any spaces. In the second half, when Craig Gardner and David  Cotterill came on, they created a better atmosphere.
"There was probably a second half penalty but it was not easy the way Nottingham Forest defended. When a team is so tight defensively it is difficult to break them down.
"We didn't concede a goal, which was very encouraging - and Gardner's first game was really positive. Obviously we need that first win as it would be very important for the morale of the players. It is coming."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"It was a positive point and a clean sheet. We did not disappoint in halting a bad run. The team showed good character and good mentality with a fine defensive attitude.
"The role of the head coach or manager is always in danger. It is part of my job. I have told the owners that the most important thing is the team and the club, not my position. I am not selfish, I am always focused on the team."
"We now have to plan quickly to strengthen the squad. Decisions have to be taken now, instead of two or three days before the deadline. It is difficult because we do not have any money but I need to know exactly what I can I can plan and decide. I have targets but I do not know my budget. I need to have a meeting with the chairman for some advice on what we can do together."
