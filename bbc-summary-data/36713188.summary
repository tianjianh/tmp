Cavan amateur Maguire is assured of her Rio spot for Ireland but Jordanstown woman Meadow is currently first replacement for 18 of the qualifiers.
Those range from 31st placed Colombian Mariajo Uribe to 60th ranked Brazilian Victoria Lovelady.
The 60-strong Rio men's and women's fields will be finalised on Monday.
Meadow, 24, has not qualified for this week's US Women's Open.
The Northern Irishwoman finished in an impressive third place behind winner Michelle Wie in the event at Pinehurst two years ago but has struggled for form over the past year following the death of her father.
Maguire, 21, will be competing in this week's major at CordeValle after earning a spot by dint of being first in the world amateur rankings at the end of 2015.
In addition to Uribe and Lovelady, the other players whose withdrawal would put Meadow in line to secure a spot are Paraguay's Julieta Granada, Mexican duo Gaby Lopez and Alejandra Llaneza, Malaysian pair Kelly Tan and Michelle Koh, Israel's Laetitia Beck, Czech Klara Spilkova, Austria's Christine Wolf, Russia's Maria Verchenova, Belgium's Chloe Leurquin, Switzerland's Fabienne In-Albon, India's Aditi Ashok, Brazil's Miriam Nagl and Hong Kong's Tiffany Chan.
In contrast to the series of withdrawals from the men's competition, mainly because of fears over the Zika virus, South Africa's Lee-Ann Pace is the only women's qualifier who has pulled out of the games.
