Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said about 1,000 tonnes of shingle on Fairbourne beach would be moved to fill in the eroded area next to the concrete defence at Friog corner.
The work is expected to take between five and 10 days, depending on the weather.
Sea defences in the village will only be maintained for 40 more years.
Fairbourne was expected to enter into "managed retreat" in 2025 due to the cost of maintaining defences, but this was extended in January.
NRW said some of the World War Two tank traps on the beach would be moved during the work, following conservation charity CADW's approval, and would be put back afterwards.
Sian Williams, NRW's head of operations in north Wales, said: "We are committed to maintaining and monitoring the flood defence in the short and medium term to help reduce the risk of flooding for the people of Fairbourne.
"Replenishing the shingle at Friog corner is part of this ongoing commitment."
The defences currently protect about 500 properties.
