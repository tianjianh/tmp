Schweinsteiger headed in the opener from David Accam's cross in his side's 2-2 draw against Montreal Impact.
The German World Cup winner, 32, moved to the United States on a free transfer from the Red Devils last month.
After the move, manager Jose Mourinho apologised for the way he treated the ex-Bayern Munich player this season.
Schweinsteiger, who was signed by the Old Trafford club under former boss Louis van Gaal in July 2015, trained alone or with the Under-23 side at United after Mourinho took over as manager last summer.
He returned to the first-team set-up before a Europa League game against Fenerbahce in November and played his last game as a substitute against Saint-Etienne in the Europa League on 22 February.
Schweinsteiger played the full 90 minutes on his home debut Chicago Fire play next on 8 April against Columbus Crew.
