Jeremy Clarkson mocks Chris Evans Top Gear 'film'

Jeremy Clarkson has joked he is making a "pilot Radio 2 breakfast show" after DJ Chris Evans said he was making "a secret Top Gear film".

Evans told Channel 4's Sunday's Brunch he was filming a "Top Gear sequence" this week, leading many to speculate he was going to present the BBC show.
However it would appear the sequence is linked to the one-off return of Evans's TFI Friday TV show on 12 June.
Formula 1 team Manor was seen carrying a logo for the programme this weekend.
Evans tweeted a picture of driver Will Stevens at the Canadian Grand Prix and later re-tweeted a message from a fan saying: "Busted! The secret TG episode is you with Manor Marussia."
There was much media speculation Evans had taken over Clarkson's Top Gear hosting duties after Sunday Brunch's Tim Lovejoy jokingly asked him if he had started to present the show.
Evans responded: "Not started yet, but we are doing a secret Top Gear film on Tuesday."
When asked to clarify if the sequence was for Top Gear, Evans said: "We're doing a Top Gear sequence with an independent production company and we're going to see how it goes."
Evans has been a favourite to take over Clarkson's presenting duties on the BBC Two show following his suspension and subsequent sacking after he assaulted a producer.
However the DJ has repeatedly ruled himself out of the job.
Clarkson later tweeted: "Next week, I'm doing a pilot Radio 2 breakfast show with an independent production company. We'll see how it goes."
Fellow Top Gear hosts Richard Hammond and James May also joined in with the joke, referencing Evans's other TV projects.
Hammond tweeted: "Next week I'm doing a pilot of The Two Show on Fridays with an independent production company. We'll see how it goes."
May added: "I'm working on a new TV idea, with an independent production company, called TFI Thursday. We'll see how it goes."
It is still unclear what will happen to Top Gear for its next series.
It was reported last week Hammond and May had been offered Â£1m deals to stay with the show, which could see different guest hosts each week rather than a direct replacement for Clarkson.
The BBC said is would not comment on "speculation" following Evans's comments.
