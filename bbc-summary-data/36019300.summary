Glasgow University has taken over the 14-acre site of the old Western Infirmary.
It said it planned to create a research and innovation hub and new buildings for social sciences, health and engineering.
An estimated 2,500 jobs will be created during the construction period.
The extension to the university's Gilmorehill campus will see a central square linking to Byres Road, and commercial opportunities in the form of restaurants, bars and a hotel.
Glasgow University principal Professor Anton Muscatelli said: "We hope to use the new site as a catalyst to attract and grow the very best academics, to attract the very best students and to ensure that Glasgow continues to be one of the top universities in the world."
The university moved from High Street to the Gilmorehill site in 1870.
A clause was signed stating that if the hospital, which opened in 1874, ever ceased to be a hospital then the university could buy back the site.
Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said: "What is especially impressive is the ambition the university has to create what is effectively a new district in the west end".
