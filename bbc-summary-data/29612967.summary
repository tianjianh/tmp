Brookes switched to Yamaha for the 2014 season and is in third position in the championship ahead of this weekend's final three races at Brands Hatch.
The Yamaha rider, 31, has clinched four victories this season in addition to a further seven podium finishes.
"I would feel like a quitter if I left the championship now," said Brookes.
"I know there was talk of me leaving BSB, but with potentially a new bike and high expectations I want to win this championship before moving on.
"Naturally the second consecutive season with a team is always better than the first because you have experiences to build on, so hopefully next year we can reach our potential of winning the championship."
Brookes also raced for Milwaukee Yamaha at the North West 200 and Isle of Man TT.
