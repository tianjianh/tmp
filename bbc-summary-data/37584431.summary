Welsh councils reorganisation: 'No one size fits all'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the structure of local government returns to the agenda - and merger proposals are effectively scrapped - Prof Catherine Farrell of the University of South Wales looks at the debate around reorganisation, and what could be on the horizon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
This topic goes back a long way, possibly starting shortly after the 22 councils were put in place in 1996.
Questions including whether they are too small to deliver services like education and social services have being asked about local authorities in Wales.
The size of public organisations is an important issue.
Bigger organisations do not necessarily deliver better services than smaller ones. No one size fits all.
Some of the biggest authorities in terms of population have above the Wales average performance in many areas.
It is also the case that, on average, the best performers are the smaller, more rural authorities.
Apart from structures, there may also be a range of other factors supporting and promoting effective services and these will also include leadership, expertise and the demand for the service.
The most effective authorities might be those with excellent leaders who can operate in a range of contexts.
At this point in 2016, finances are really stretched like never before and ministers might look back and wonder why structural reorganisation has not happened.
For now, a full scale re-organisation is off the agenda. It is too expensive and too much of a distraction. The public want the focus to be on services and not structures.
Instead, and building on existing good practice, local authorities will do what they have been doing for some time - building up effective joint working around service delivery.
It is reduced budgets, cuts in funding and a desire on behalf of local politicians and officers to keep up services that have been a big driver of this change rather than politicians in Welsh Government.
There are many joint arrangements in place and shared officers across a number of authorities - and this pattern is incrementally changing local government as we know it.
The Welsh Government is now keen for this joint working to go much further.
Local Government Secretary Mark Drakeford laid out his vision for the future of local government in Wales on Tuesday and said the current 22 councils will remain in place unless there were cases where authorities wanted to merge voluntarily.
The minister is keen on an approach where cities and regions are responsible for services, including strategic transport, and economic development, with organisations similar to health boards in Wales delivering other services, including education and social services.
Local authorities will be strongly encouraged to deliver services jointly and work even more closely with other bodies including health, police and the ambulance service.
Clearly, then the agenda is much more regional for the delivery of key services.
Over the next five years I think that a new pattern of local government will emerge and there will be joint heads of service across two or three councils in some areas of delivery and maybe even a shared chief executive or two.
A few councils are likely to merge voluntarily.
It might look like there are 20-22 authorities but behind this, there will be a complex web of shared leadership and service delivery.
Structure will not be important.
In the new more developed world of collaboration, a big issue will be the integration with other services and not just local government - police, fire and rescue, ambulance, housing, health and so on.
Joint working arrangements to deliver services will become the norm and these will be different across different parts of Wales.
The citizens of Wales have a right to the best services. It is these services, with on-time delivery, of the highest quality, which interest citizens more than structures.
