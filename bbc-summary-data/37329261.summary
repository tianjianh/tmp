Police said the man left a yacht in Brixham harbour and did not return. His empty dinghy was later found.
Torbay and Teighmouth lifeboats joined police divers in the search which stopped at 21:00 BST on Saturday due to low light.
Devon and Cornwall police resumed the search on Sunday and are in discussions with HM coastguard over how to proceed.
A police spokesman said: "At this stage, we are still treating it as if there is someone missing, although we are still undertaken enquiries to establish whether in fact this is the case."
