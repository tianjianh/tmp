Plea to parents after manhole covers thrown from Bristol bridge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents are being told to "get control" of their children after manhole covers were thrown from a Bristol bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five youths dropped concrete posts and manhole covers off an A4174 bridge on 6 April, the Bristol Post reported.
A dispersal order has been put in place in Longwell Green following the "dangerous and reckless" behaviour of children.
Ch Insp Mark Evans, said: "We don't want to criminalise children, but we need to take action."
Over the past six weeks the anti-social behaviour of a group of children - some as young as nine - has escalated in the Barrs Court, Longwell Green and Oldland Common areas, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Last week, two 15-year-old boys were arrested for breaching a dispersal order.
In addition, an 18-year-old man was given a street caution and a 16-year-old boy was arrested and street bailed for possessing cannabis.
Ch Insp Evans said children are being dropped off by parents who are not "fully aware of the danger their children are putting themselves or others in".
"What we're finding now is they're stepping up their behaviour and it's becoming more reckless and is beginning to put lives in danger," he said.
"Up until now we've been using dispersal powers to move on those causing problems, but we've now reached the stage where we're making arrests with the intention of bringing offenders to justice for their actions.
"So the appeal to parents is to get control of your children."
