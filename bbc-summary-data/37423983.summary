[SN]TITLE[SN]
Officer from West Midlands Police 'hit detainee up to 12 times'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police custody sergeant struck a detainee up to 12 times around the face and head after a dispute over a phone call, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jason Hayles, 44, of West Midlands Police, denies assaulting Clinton Copeland causing him actual bodily harm at Stechford police station in Birmingham on 25 February last year.
He is alleged to have used excessive force against the robbery suspect.
Jurors were told Mr Copeland was trying to bite Sgt Hayles' arm and chest.
The officer is alleged to have used excessive force after grabbing the 30-year-old detainee around the neck when he lunged forward.
Describing CCTV footage to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court, prosecutor Simon Davis said it showed Mr Copeland leaving a room where he had seen a doctor.
Mr Davis said: "You will then see him go and sit on a bench as he was waiting to make a phone call to someone he had nominated."
After a "lively debate" Sgt Hayles walked out from behind a custody desk towards Mr Copeland where it is alleged the officer struck him a number of times to the face, the court heard.  Mr Davis added: "We say that this wasn't self-defence".
Mr Copeland admitted lunging towards and swearing at Sgt Hayles before he was restrained and allegedly assaulted, but claims he did so in order to make his way back towards a cell.  He denied he had lunged at the officer in a bid to assault him.
He told the court his face was left covered in blood and he required an emergency head scan after being taken to hospital.
Jurors were told Mr Copeland has numerous convictions for violence.
The trial continues.
