Northern Ireland victims commissioner delay criticised

The Office of the First and Deputy First Minister has been strongly criticised for failing to appoint a victims commissioner a year after the last one left.

The process to replace Kathryn Stone has been plagued with problems.
Alex Bunting, who lost a leg in an IRA bomb attack, said he would only believe the long wait for an appointment was over "when they announce it on television".
"We do need someone asap, because if we don't get them as soon as possible its going to get worse for victims," he told BBC NI's The View.
"They've told us about three times over this past year they were going to get someone appointed very soon and we're still waiting.
"I know the process is finished in this round. This is the second round of interviews for a commissioner. I have to say the say I'll believe it is the day they announce it on television."
In January, First Minister Peter Robinson told the assembly the first round had failed to produce a winner and there had been "a disappointingly small pool of appointable candidates".
However, it is understood two people were judged to be appointable, but not appropriate for the role.
Mr Robinson said the salary for the post may have to be increased. It was re-advertised more widely and a second round of interviews was conducted in May.
A spokesperson for the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister said the process was at "an advanced stage" and they hoped to make an announcement shortly.
The hiatus has caused a problem for the Victims Forum. Several members have left without being replaced because that can only be done by a commissioner.
The secretary to the Victims Commission, John Beggs, has been carrying out the role on an interim basis but said the situation had been "extremely difficult."
"We have been able to get on with our research on victims issues," he said.
"We've been able to get on with our engagement with individuals and groups, [but] to bring that to a culmination we really need a commissioner to consider that advice and take it directly to ministers; to take it directly to government and to make sure it is acted upon and that is the missing part of the equation as it stands.
"I can't give opinion and commentary as a victims commissioner could under their legal authority, so in many ways a lot of the work we are doing goes unseen and unheard in the media and in the sector and that is very frustrating for us in the commission, particularly at a time when there are so many victims issue in the press and in the media."
The failure to appoint has been criticised by two former victims commissioners, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and Patricia MacBride.
Mr Nesbitt said Stormont was in danger of losing all credibility because it could not make difficult decisions.
Ms MacBride said it was "appalling" that victims and survivors were being put in a position where they were having to "fight their own battles" to get the help they needed.
