Women's British Open: Catriona Matthew salutes 'one of my best ever rounds'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Catriona Matthew has described the seven-under par 65 that shot her into contention at the Women's British Open as one of her best rounds of golf.

The 2009 champion lies fourth, two shots behind the leader, South Korea's Mirim Lee, after two rounds at Woburn.
"That's probably one of the best rounds I've played," said the 46-year-old.
"I gave myself lots of chances and holed my fair share of them. To give myself a chance on Sunday would be fantastic."
Matthew is playing her 83rd major championship and has finished in the top five nine times, including that 2009 win at Royal Lytham & St Annes.
But the Scot admitted she would love another top title to her name before she winds down her career.
"The crowd were great today, so if I can get in their in contention on Sunday, I'm sure there would be a fantastic atmosphere," she told BBC Sport.
"I think I hit 18 greens today and just hit one awful shot on 16 but then followed it with probably my best shot of the day - the four iron on to the green."
Matthew was recently appointed as a vice-captain of the European team for next year's Solheim Cup and also received Scottish Golf's lifetime achievement award.
Another landmark follows the British Open as she prepares to represent Team GB at the Olympic Games in Rio.
"That's a huge achievement," said Matthew. "Growing up, I never thought I would play at an Olympics, so it has been a goal of mine for the last couple of years to try to make the team.
"It will probably be my only chance given where I am with my career, so I was delighted when I made it and I can't wait to go.
"I am going down a few days early to watch some other things and then get ready for the golf."
With Matthew at Woburn and travelling with her to Brazil will be husband Graeme, who does not get to caddie for her so often these days now they have two daughters.
"Fortunately, we have some very helpful grandparents," she said.
"It will be great to have Graeme there. He doesn't get to come out often now, so it will be great fun."
Childcare issues mean the husband and wife team will miss the opening ceremony in Rio.
"We don't fly down until the 12th," added Matthew. "We just couldn't be away that long from the children."
