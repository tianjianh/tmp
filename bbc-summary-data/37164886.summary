McCarthy earned $33m (£25m) before tax between June 2015 and June 2016, making her the world's second highest paid actress, behind Jennifer Lawrence.
Johansson, who was placed second last year, dropped to third, earning $25m (£19m) across the year.
It tops off a busy year for McCarthy, which saw her appear in the all-female Ghostbusters reboot, as well as The Boss, which topped the US box office.
Johansson has appeared in Captain America: Civil War, the remake of The Jungle Book and the Coen brothers' film Hail Ceasar! over the last year.
Forbes reported Lawrence earned $46m (£34.9m) before tax over 12 months to make her the world's highest-paid actress for the second year running.
She appeared in the last film in The Hunger Games franchise and the Oscar-nominated Joy during that time.
Former Friends star Jennifer Aniston's earnings of $21m (£15.9m) scored her fourth place while Chinese actress Fan Bingbing was fifth with her annual takings of $17m (£12.9m).
The only new addition to this year's list was Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone, who earned $10m (£7.6m) to take 10th place.
According to Forbes, Padukone earns considerably less than her Hollywood counterparts for her on-screen roles, but supplements her income with multiple lucrative endorsements.
Charlize Theron, Amy Adams, Julia Roberts and Mila Kunis completed the top 10.
A separate list of highest-paid male actors will be published on Thursday.
