The American, 22, is nine shots behind American joint leaders Keegan Bradley, Ken Duke and Charles Howell III.
"I got off to a poor start," said Spieth. "It was a very tough day."
Spieth, who will defend his Masters title in April, also missed the cut at the Northern Trust Open in February.
The defending champion never recovered from making five bogeys and a birdie in the first seven holes.
