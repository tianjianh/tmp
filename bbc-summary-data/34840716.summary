Swimmers have been warned to stay out of the water off far east Gippsland in Victoria, Australia, after a large shark was spotted stalking a whale carcass that washed up on the shore.

The state parks authority tweeted images of what appears to be a 4m (13ft) white pointer at Salmon Rocks.
Parks Victoria worker Mike Irvine said he was surprised to spot the shark heading towards the beached whale.
Authorities said the whale probably died of natural causes.
They said they were monitoring it but hoped the carcass would wash out to sea with the tide.
"It was in knee-deep, waist-deep water, a decent-sized shark thrashing around every time it got in the shallows and got back out to deeper water and cruised back and forward then had another go," Mr Irvine told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"It's a natural thing for whales to die and sharks to come in and clean up the mess."
"I grabbed my daughter's hand pretty tightly a couple of times and said 'don't go in the water'."
