[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey hospital to use temporary surgical wards

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two surgical wards at Guernsey's main hospital could be replaced with a temporary structure for at least the next two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The health department already hoped to move patients from Giffard Ward, which has suffered from structural problems and leaks, into a temporary ward.
Now it hopes to also move the patients from the De Saumarez Ward, if planners approve of the temporary building.
A decision on future of the wards is due before the end of the year.
The updated plans for the Princess Elizabeth Hospital site involve building a second storey on the temporary structure.
