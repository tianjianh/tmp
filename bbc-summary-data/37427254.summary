Tom James: Cardiff Blues wing agrees new Arms Park deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales international wing Tom James has agreed a new long-term deal with Cardiff Blues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James first played for Blues in 2006 and returned to the region in 2015 after spending two seasons with Exeter.
The 29-year-old has scored 51 tries in 136 appearances over two spells with the Arms Park-based region.
"Tom is a key player for us and will be an important part of what we are trying to build here," said Blues head coach Danny Wilson.
"I'm delighted we have been able to secure one of the in-form Welsh players to a new, long-term contract and hope there are many more performances like we have seen so far this season to come."
The 29-year-old has played 12 times for Wales - his last appearance coming against Scotland in the 2016 Six Nations championship.
James has been a key player in Blues' unbeaten start to the new Pro12 season - scoring two tries in the 24-23 away win against Munster and impressing in the home win against Glasgow.
"I couldn't get the deal signed quick enough," said James.
"I left because I wanted to test myself in a new environment and improve as a player. I was very happy to come back ahead of last season and I feel I came back a better player.
"I've been really pleased with the way things have gone and I bit Danny's hand off when he offered me this new deal."
