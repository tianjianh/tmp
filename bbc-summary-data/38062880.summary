BBC One drama Capital, based on the novel by John Lanchester, won the prize for best TV movie or mini series.
Dustin Hoffman received the best actor award for his performance in the BBC One TV movie Roald Dahl's Esio Trot.
The comedy prize was won by Hoff The Record starring David Hasselhoff, which is produced in the UK and broadcast on Dave.
