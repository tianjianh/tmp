The body of Ravi Kumar, from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, was spotted inside a crevice.
Three other climbers died over the same weekend and over a dozen were rescued after running into difficulties.
Mr Kumar had successfully scaled Everest, but was separated from his guide on the climb down.
He is believed to have fallen almost 200m (657 feet) to his death.
The guide was earlier found unconscious at Camp 4, just below 8,000 metres, with severe frostbite.
The tourism agency that facilitated Mr Kumar's climb told the Press Trust of India news agency that it would not be possible to retrieve his body immediately.
