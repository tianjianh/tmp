[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 2-2 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Taylor grabbed a late equaliser to earn 10-man Rotherham a thrilling draw against Nottingham Forest after a frantic final 15 minutes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor sidefooted the hosts ahead but Matt Mills headed Forest's equaliser.
And, after Darnell Fisher was sent off for a second caution, Apostolos Vellios scored with a stunning overhead kick.
But Taylor curled the ball in to level and they held on, although Forest substitute Nicklas Bendtner nearly won it when his header hit the post.
New signing Bendtner went agonisingly close to a dream debut after home goalkeeper Lee Camp made a fine save from Henri Lansbury, but the former Arsenal striker could not find the net with a glorious chance on the rebound.
Even the possibility of an away win seemed unlikely following a first half of few chances and little excitement.
But, after former Forest man Greg Halford wasted a great chance to double Rotherham's lead in the second period, the visitors suddenly started playing with more urgency and turned the match on its head.
Mills met Lansbury's right-footed corner from 12 yards out and Camp - another former Reds player - was too easily beaten.
Fisher's red card further boosted Forest and Vellios' second goal in two games seemed to have ensured victory.
However, Taylor's fine low strike earned Rotherham a third draw in seven Championship  matches, and meant the two sides shared the points for the eighth successive league match.
Rotherham United manager Alan Stubbs:
"I thought that was our best performance of the season. I thought we should have had the three points, although it feels like a moral victory.
"I must have run over a black cat with some of the luck that didn't go our way.
"At 2-1 down the fans were right behind the team and I thought getting the equaliser was the least we deserved. Sometimes you do get the rewards when you put the hard work in."
Nottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier:
"It was enjoyment followed by disappointment.
"For me, they played well in the first half and were even better in the second until right at the end. They gave me everything and I am really proud of my players.
"We are getting closer to winning our first away game."
Match ends, Rotherham United 2, Nottingham Forest 2.
