The former Labour leader of Tower Hamlets, standing independently for Tower Hamlets First, received 43.38% of first preference votes.
He addressed supporters outside Troxy theatre in Stepney, east London, after the result at about 02:00 BST.
He said an investigation ordered by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles had been "politically motivated".
Mr Pickles appointed inspectors to look into allegations of governance failure, poor financial management and fraud following a report by the BBC's Panorama which found Mr Rahman had more than doubled funding recommended by officers for Bengali-run charities.
Inspectors have until 30 June to report their findings.
In the mayoral election, Labour candidate John Biggs received 32.82% of first preference votes.
Mr Rahman said: "The people of this borough have spoken again.
"I want to thank the thousands of people who have been outside in the rain for six or seven hours waiting for a result.
"All we want is an equal playing field. To see obstacles being placed in my way unfairly, I find that quite difficult to accept."
He added: "Judge me on my record. Judge me on what we have done for the people of this borough.
"The only borough in the land who has delivered an educational maintenance allowance. The only borough in the land who has delivered a university grant of Â£1500 for our students going to university."
He also pointed to his elderly homecare policies and free primary school meals coming in in September.
Meanwhile, the council election count has been suspended. A spokesman said it will resume at 14:00 BST on Sunday when six wards will be recounted.
Turnout: 84,234 (45.9%)
