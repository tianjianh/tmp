Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Holly Clyburn recorded a 7&5 victory over Pornanong Phatlum and Porani Chutichai, and Mel Reid and Charley Hull beat Ariya Jutanugarn and Moriya Jutanugarn 3&1.
Hull had missed play on Friday because of asthma and a fever.
Victory saw England advance to Sunday's concluding singles in Illinois.
