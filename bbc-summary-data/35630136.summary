Manchester-born Ian Lawson travelled around the Western Isles to capture his images of crofters, their sheep and the weaving of wool used for the tweed.
The project was carried out over the course of 10 years in collaboration with the Harris Tweed Authority.
Lake District-based Mr Lawson's photographs will be at Rheged Centre Gallery in Penrith until 15 May.
The exhibition, called From the Land, will also be held at the An Lanntair arts centre in Stornoway from 1 July to 16 August.
Harris Tweed is hand-woven on the Western Isles.
Mr Lawson sought to capture the people and landscapes associated with the manufacture of the cloth.
Earlier this month Harris Tweed's orb trademark was officially recognised as a coat of arms.
For years, the mark has identified tweed made from cloth woven by hand in the Western Isles with wool yarn from island sheep.
The Lord Lyon, King of Arms, has granted that the orb be the industry's coat of arms.
The Harris Tweed Authority said the recognition would provide a further layer of protection from imitations.
The orb will be incorporated into a shield to become the coat of arms.
