Residents reported a rock fall west of Burton Bradstock on Thursday morning.
Ian Hackworthy, who lives nearby, photographed the cliffs from a distance but said it was too dangerous to get any closer.
The Jurassic Coast Team said the collapse appeared to have happened at high tide and it warned people to stay away. The coastguard said its officers were at the scene.
Sam Rose, Jurassic Coast World Heritage site manager, said: "Unlike Charmouth, Burton Bradstock is definitely not a place for fossil hunting.
"People should stay away from the top and base of the cliffs and follow the National Trust guidance on signs around the coast."
The collapse happened on National Trust land.
Cliff falls and landslips are commonplace on the Jurassic Coast, where the power of the sea is continually eroding the coastline.
One of the biggest was in 2008 when 400m (1,312ft) of cliff slipped and blocked a beach between Lyme Regis and Charmouth.
In 2012, holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman was killed when 400 tonnes of rock collapsed on to Hive Beach at Burton Bradstock.
