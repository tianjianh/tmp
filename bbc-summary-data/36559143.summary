[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to redevelop Swansea's Castle Square into a "city park" have been given the go-ahead by councillors.

Companies now have permission to bid to redevelop the square, after approval by Swansea council on Thursday.
A developer has already submitted proposals to build three "quality restaurants" there and refurbish the site.
Council leader Rob Stewart said the square was "tired" but could be transformed.
The city park would form part of the planned regeneration of Swansea which was unveiled by the council in January.
A public open spaces notice will now be published, giving people the chance to give their views.
Proposals will then be invited, with the council to consider whether the schemes could affect public access or events.
Mr Stewart said: "Castle Square is looking tired, but it's a key location that has the potential to become a special destination in a revitalised Swansea city centre.
"If cabinet agrees to the consideration of redevelopment opportunities at Castle Square, then a marketing exercise could lead to the potential for private investment, which would be a good thing.
"This would reduce costs to the taxpayer, but we will also protect public access and usage in any future scheme."
The council said preliminary discussions have also started with retailers, restaurants, cinema operators and housing developers as part of the redevelopment of the St David's and Civic Centre sites.
