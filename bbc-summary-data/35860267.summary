Wildlife officials said that the baby had been found alone near a forest camp in the area.
It will be kept under observation for two weeks, receiving medical care.
As its mother has not been found, the calf has been placed in a rehabilitation centre with two other rhino calves that are being hand raised.
Wildlife officials told the BBC that the baby rhino had been introduced to the other two calves in order to "comfort" it.
If placed in rehabilitation, the rhino calf will only be released into the wild after it turns four.
