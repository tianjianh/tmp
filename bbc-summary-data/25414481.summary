Witnesses told the state-run al-Ahram newspaper that he was dragged from his vehicle after running over one of the protesters at the rally on Monday in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura.
A preliminary medical report said he died from a deep cut to the neck. A photo of his body was posted online.
The interior ministry said that police had arrested 10 suspects.
The protester who the taxi driver is said to have run over was in a critical condition in a hospital in Mansoura, al-Ahram quoted a Facebook page called "Al-Azhar University in Mansoura" as saying.
The protesters were reportedly supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement of ousted President Mohammed Morsi.
Security has deteriorated in Egypt in the nearly three years since the uprising that forced President Hosni Mubarak to resign. There were a number of lynchings during Mr Morsi's one-year rule.
In June, four Shia Muslims were lynched by a mob apparently led by ultraconservative Salafist clerics in a village outside the capital, Cairo.
Three months earlier, vigilantes hanged two suspected thieves in a rural Nile Delta village as a crowd of thousands watched.
