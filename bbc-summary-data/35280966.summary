Italian scientists found a skull as well as some smaller bones.
It's believed the creature was almost ten metres long, weighing three tons, making it the biggest ever crocodile to live in the ocean.
They have named the new discovery Machimosaurus rex.
With its massive skull scientists say it would have had a strong bite, hunting large turtles and fish, and even catching land animals that came too close to the water.
