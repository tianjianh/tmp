The 23-year-old Arsenal midfielder also missed the 7-0 win against the same team at Adams Park on Saturday.
England are a point behind Group Seven leaders Belgium with a game in hand.
Victory in Stara Pazova on Tuesday would move Mark Sampson's side above Belgium at the top of the table and secure a runners-up spot at least for next year's finals in the Netherlands.
However, Karen Carney is expecting a much tougher game against Serbia than at the weekend.
"No two games are ever the same," said the Chelsea forward, who scored a hat-trick on Saturday.
"It's going to be difficult but as long as we're not complacent, as long as we press the same, go at them and try and get the early goal again I think we should be OK.
"But it's going to be tough. It will be a different game, for sure."
The eight group winners and the six best runners-up will join the hosts in an expanded 16-team event.
The other two runners-up will play off in October 2016 for the remaining spot.
England and Belgium meet in the final round of group games on 20 September.
