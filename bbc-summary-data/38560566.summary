Conwy safer coach drop-off for tourists sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A scheme to make the medieval town of Conwy safer for foreign tourists who arrive by coach is set for approval.

The historic walled market town is popular with overseas visitors, but if they arrive in a left-hand drive coach at the drop-off point, they have to step out into moving traffic.
The drop-off point could be widened to provide a walkway on the right side for foreign-registered coaches.
Residents have expressed concerns coaches are avoiding the town.
The work would cost Â£85,910.
A report by Marianne Jackson, Conwy council's head of community development service, says: "The existing coach drop off and pick up point in Conwy is well located from a passenger point of view, but presents a growing road safety risk with the lack of separation from the flow of traffic through the town centre.
"This risk is amplified as we strive to increase the market share of continental visitors to Conwy, as any overseas visitors arriving by continental coach when entering or disembarking will be on the off-side of the coach.
"This means that, without a footway on the off-side of the coach, they do so into and from the adjacent live carriageway, thus presenting a considerable road safety hazard."
Deputy mayor of Conwy, Bill Chapman said: "If it's a bus from another country, from France, from Germany, people can get off and walk straight into the traffic so there is a danger to our visitors.
"We need our visitors here in this town and we don't want to have them killed on the streets of Conwy."
Toby Tunstall, chairman of Conwy chamber of trade said the work was much needed.
"It can be quite frightening," he told BBC Wales. "We see people getting off coaches and going straight across the road with traffic driving pass.  Getting back on the coach, they will cross the road with cars coming across their path.
"We need the coach trade to keep the tourist industry in Conwy going.  The foreign visitors at the moment in particular are really keeping us going at a quiet time of year.  These improvements are a really good idea."
The council is proposing taking part of the car park away to give buses more room to park and providing a pavement on the other side of the lay-by to keep pedestrians safe.
Conwy council's cabinet is being recommended to approve the money needed for the work to take place.
