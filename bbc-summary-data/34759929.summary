I spent Remembrance Sunday, as standard bearer for the RAF Association at  Portsmouth Guildhall Square.
This is my 35th year in the job. Every year I say it will be my last, but I suppose I will still be polishing up the brass work and marching on - slowly - next year. William Walker, Portsmouth

I think of all his comrades and contemporaries who did not make it and the countless others subsequently who made the same sacrifice. Christopher Stock, UK
