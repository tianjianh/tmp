[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flood protection decision sought for Whitesands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Councillors are being asked to back a scheme designed to tackle long-standing flooding problems in the Whitesands area of Dumfries.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thousands of people signed a petition against original plans for an embankment in the area.
Now a "raised walkway" is being proposed with a glass wall on top.
The total cost of the project would be about Â£15m and councillors are being asked to endorse the project which could be completed by 2019.
A walkway has been recommended as the "optimal solution" to the issues regularly experienced when the River Nith overflows, affecting nearby streets and properties.
Council officers have advised against a self-rising barrier due to technical challenges and environmental constraints.
