The Matthew Clark lorry, which delivers beer, is understood to have crashed on Calton Road after rolling down a steep slope.
The accident happened near the Black Bull and Pivo just before 15:30. Calton Road has been closed in both directions.
An eyewitness said: "The lorry swerved to miss a black car and crashed into two walls, I expect due to the rain."
A spokeswoman for drinks wholesaler Matthew Clarke said no-one had been injured, and the company was helping to clear up the site.
She said: "We apologise for any disruption caused and will be working with police to investigate what happened."
In a statement, police confirmed they were attending a "road collision on Calton Road involving a beer delivery truck, which has struck a wall".
It said Calton Road was closed to pedestrians and through-traffic between its junction with Leith Street and New Street.
A spokesman confirmed that road closures were "anticipated to be in place for the next few hours until a recovery vehicle arrives", but said access was still available for cars and pedestrians to the back entrance of Waverly Station.
A spokeswoman for the Black Bull said the pub was temporarily closed while the full extent of any damage was assessed.
