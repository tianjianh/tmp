Marmalade raises hundreds for Cumbria flood appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jar of marmalade has raised hundreds of pounds at auction to help those affected by flooding in Cumbria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Fine Cut Seville Orange marmalade was made by chefs at Sharrow Bay Hotel in Ullswater.
Laced with Louis Marcellin 1967 Armagnac and garnished with gold leaf flakes, the chefs wanted to produce the "world's most expensive" marmalade.
The £385 raised in the eBay auction will go to the Cumbria Flood Appeal which was set up in December.
The Cumbria Community Foundation established the appeal, which has raised nearly £6m, to help people in the county in the wake of Storm Desmond.
The hotel's marketing manager Heather James said: "We were in the office thinking about what we could do for a special edition marmalade, and it was a bit of a joke when it first set off, but we started thinking how about we make it the most expensive one?
"So we looked into what we could find to make it the most expensive one, and it grew from there."
