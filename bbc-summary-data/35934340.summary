[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roy Blackman, 73, was found dead at the house in Headcorn Road, Biddenden, on 21 March. Tests revealed he died from multiple blunt force injuries.
Two 36-year-old men, from the Cranbrook area, were detained in the early hours on suspicion of murder, police said.
A 49-year-old man arrested last week has been bailed until 28 April.
Officers believe the break-in took place sometime between 01:00 and 03:00 GMT on the day Mr Blackman's body was found.
Detectives said "a vulnerable man" had been targeted in what appeared to have been "a violent burglary".
They have been trying to locate a safe missing from the property, and searched a disused business park in Sutton Valence as part of their inquiries.
