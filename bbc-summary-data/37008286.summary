Contactless card payment technology is being installed in Chester's medieval walls to encourage people to contribute to their upkeep.

Visitors will be asked to make a donation by using bank cards or smart phones at the terminals.
They are being installed at three locations of the walls; Amphitheatre, King Charles Tower and Newgate Tower.
Donations are voluntary and the walls are still a free attraction, Cheshire West and Chester Council said.
It is hoped the scheme - which encourages people to make a Â£2 donation - will pay for the upkeep of the Grade I-listed sandstone walls, which currently cost the council Â£600,000 a year.
It will be trialled for three months.

Councillor Louise Gittins, cabinet member for communities and wellbeing, said: "We know there is an appetite to make a donation as our visitors have asked in the past. However, the emphasis is for a donation only if they wish to do so.
"Asking visitors to donate is nothing new and increasingly commonplace amongst national museums and attractions."
