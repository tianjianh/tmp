[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 1-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Lowe's last-gasp header saw Guiseley sensationally escape the drop at the expense of York with a 1-1 draw at home to Solihull.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A goal down, the nervy Lions never looked like getting the one, vital equaliser they needed to overhaul the Minstermen and sneak to safety.
But, in the dying seconds, a long throw-in by substitute Danny East was met by Lowe, who headed over Nathan Baxter.
Solihull had done York proud by fighting hard for the win. They spurned a chance from the penalty spot before Omari Sterling-James's free-kick put them ahead in the first half.
The tension mounted, and Sterling-James had a shot cleared off the line, but in dramatic fashion Guiseley found 11th-hour salvation.
York's game finished slightly later, leaving an anxious wait but news filtered through about their 2-2 draw, enough to spread relief around Nethermoor Park.
