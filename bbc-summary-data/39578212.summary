In 2015-16, 20 churches in Caerphilly, Newport and Swansea opened their doors and, since 2014, parishes have given land to create 30 affordable homes.
The Church in Wales launched a project to help more homeless people, ex-offenders and migrants.
Housing Justice Cymru gathered data ahead of a road show in April and May.
It will start in Wrexham, where 61 rough sleepers were recorded over a two-week period last October - the highest number outside Cardiff.
The Bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, said: "Homelessness is not a problem that effects individuals, it effects communities and society more widely.
"It is something that can really only be addressed through all of the community acting together to tackle the causes of homelessness."
