[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Resilient Leeds scored three tries in the last 15 minutes as they came from behind to beat Catalans in Perpignan.

Rhinos trailed 16-12 at the break after first-half tries from Louis Anderson, Julian Bousquet and Brayden Wiliame.
Liam Sutcliffe and Stevie Ward scored Leeds' converted first-half tries.
Trailing 22-12 after Remy Casty's try, Adam Cuthbertson and Rob Burrow then scored before Richie Myler's penalty for Catalans, but Danny McGuire went over for a 77th-minute winning try.
Sutcliffe added the conversion, just as he had to Leeds' four other tries, while Tony Gigot, taking over kicking duties from missing pair Luke Walsh and Krisnan Inu, earlier kicked three goals for the hosts.
Catalans lost influential Australian World Cup winner Greg Bird after just five minutes following an eye injury as he attempted to tackle Tom Briscoe. But Leeds were weakened too, making light of the absence of Ryan Hall and Kallum Watkins on international duty.
The game turned on two tries in as many minutes as first Cuthbertson charged on to McGuire's pass to charge over from 30 metres out before the wily Burrow latched on to the end of a flowing last tackle move to score in the corner.
With eight minutes left, Dragons levelled with a penalty after Thomas Bosc had been held down in the tackle. But McGuire had the last word with a classic solo effort, collecting the ball on the right before running across the field to break through a tiring Catalans defence.
That helped Leeds climb back up to third in the table, level with second-placed Salford - and two points behind leaders Castleford, who they play at Wheldon Road next Sunday.
Catalans Dragons head coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"There were two forward passes in the build-up to their two tries around 65 minutes. Unfortunately, those two tries cost us. My players deserved a lot more.
"Circumstances were against us. I am having the same conversations every week about how we don't get the 50-50 calls. Tonight, we didn't get the 60-40 calls.
"I understand the fans' frustrations. It is something that we have to deal with but, in tight games like this, those decisions can make all the difference."
Leeds coach Brian McDermott:
"Danny McGuire and Adam Cuthbertson were outstanding. Adam was hugely influential in that final 20 minutes but then Danny McGuire maintained calm and had a good control over the majority of proceedings."
"We were great. None of it was brilliant, but we came over here and played against a team who had a disappointing loss last week and were really fired up.
"It's tough to come here and get used to being put on the back foot, on your own try line, whether you think you should be there or not."
