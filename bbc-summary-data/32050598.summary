Amelia Jones: Granddad's head blow 'killed baby'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grandfather killed his five-week-old granddaughter with a fatal blow to the back of her head, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Jones, 45, of Cwmbran, denies murdering Amelia Jones in Pontnewydd near Cwmbran in November 2012.
Newport Crown Court heard she suffered a skull fracture, brain swelling and multiple rib fractures and had been injured at least three different times.
Prosecutors said Mr Jones had intended to at least cause grievous bodily harm to the baby.
Paul Lewis QC said: "The injuries inflicted upon Amelia included a fracture to the back of her skull, swelling to her brain and multiple fractures to her ribs.
"These injuries were all of different ages ... and they demonstrate she had been subjected to violence on at least three occasions. But it was the most recent of these injuries to her [which] had brought upon her cause of death.
"The prosecution case is that in the short tragic life of Amelia the injuries which she came by could not have been accidental.
"These injuries were all deliberately inflicted upon her by her grandfather."
Amelia was rushed to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital in a state of cardiac arrest after Mr Jones called 999 saying she was not breathing.
She was transferred to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and died on Monday 19 November.
The trial continues.
