Warnock, 67, succeeded Paul Trollope as Bluebirds manager in October.
He held talks with Nottingham Forest and Blackburn but chose Cardiff after speaking to his wife Sharon, who was diagnosed with breast cancer last year.
"She's had her chemotherapy and her hair's growing back, and she said: 'Look, another club will do me - you can have one more'," said Warnock.
"I did talk to Forest and Blackburn and one or two others and for whatever reason they never came to fruition.
"Cardiff has always been my kind of club. It just seemed right.

"I just thought it's my cup of tea. The fans like blood and thunder and I thought what another great opportunity for me."
Before joining Cardiff, Warnock had been out of work since the end of the 2015-16 season after helping Rotherham avoid relegation from the Championship.
The former Sheffield United and QPR manager believes he can win promotion with Cardiff, even though they are second from bottom in the table.
Warnock has made former QPR winger Junior Hoilett his first signing at Cardiff, and he hopes to make further additions to the squad.
Striker Marouane Chamakh and centre-back Sol Bamba - both free agents - have had medicals with the Bluebirds.
Former Aston Villa and Manchester United winger-come-defender Kieran Richardson has also been linked with the club.
Warnock told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "I wouldn't write off two or three players [as well as Hoilett] joining us."
