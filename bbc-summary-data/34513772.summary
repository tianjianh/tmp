A police recruitment event, which was due to be held in Londonderry on Saturday, has been cancelled following the discovery of a bomb last week.

The device was found in the grounds of the Waterfoot Hotel last Friday. Police have blamed dissident republicans.
The owner of the Waterfoot Hotel, Garvan O'Doherty, said he cancelled the event for "health and safety reasons".
The police are looking at an alternative venue for the recruitment session.
A controlled explosion was carried out following the discovery of the device on Friday.
On Tuesday, Mr O'Doherty said he "must take into consideration the safety and well-being of my staff and customers".
"The tactic adopted by dissidents is dangerous and deadly," he said.
"It is with great regret that I have to cancel this event, but I have to protect the people.
"I think the police are doing a great job and I believe in the Good Friday Agreement.
"We are there 24 hours a day and I will not take that risk of something, maybe, happening again.
"There may be some council facilities that are available for events like this.
"There is an appetite to join the police but we have to re-group and get the message across that violence does not work."
PSNI Ass Ch Con Mark Hamilton said: "I am aware of the disruption that was caused by the security operation in Derry last week and would like to thank everyone who co-operated and worked with our officers.
"I would also like to thank the management and staff at the hotel for their support throughout.
"We are currently seeking an alternative venue for this event and remain committed to providing encouragement and information to those who wish to find out more about the opportunities that exist within the Police Service.
"Clearly there are people out there in today's society who are still intent on targeting our police service and causing harm to our communities.
"We know, however, that the actions of these few misguided individuals will not stop people pursuing a career in policing."
Mr Hamilton said 2,700 applications have been put forward in the current recruitment process so far.
There were also security alerts at two other venues last week where recruitment events were due to take place. Nothing untoward was found.
Dr Michael Wardlow, chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, described recent incidents as "unacceptable".
"If we wish to live in a tolerant and respectful society, it is important that the whole community supports the right of people to choose whether or not to join the police," he said.
