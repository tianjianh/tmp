About 850 Arriva drivers at depots in Castleford, Dewsbury, Heckmondwike and Wakefield in West Yorkshire, and Selby in North Yorkshire, are to walk out.
The strike is due to start at 03:00 GMT on Monday, said Unite the union.
Arriva said it wanted to "wholeheartedly apologise" to customers who could be affected by the industrial action.

Nigel Featham, from Arriva Yorkshire and North East, said: "We have been working tirelessly over the last year with Unite to bring pay talks to an amicable conclusion.
"But despite our best efforts and multiple offers to increase pay and conditions we have received notification to strike."
Phil Bown, of Unite, said no further meetings were currently planned between the two sides.
"Strike action is not a step our members take lightly, but after nearly 12 months of circular talks they have become increasingly angry about being strung along by Arriva bosses," he added.
Limited Arriva bus services could operate during the strike. Yorkshire Tiger services would be unaffected, the company said.
