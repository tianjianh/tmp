The baby, who has not been named, was attacked at a property in Morning Star Road, Daventry, last Friday and was pronounced dead at hospital.
Her grandmother, who was caring for her, was injured trying to protect her.
A serious case review committee is to meet next month to consider if Northamptonshire's Safeguarding Children Board should investigate.
In a statement, the baby's family said: "We are totally devastated and in complete shock for the tragic loss of our little princess."
The dog was destroyed by vets at the scene and its breed was confirmed at a post-mortem carried out at the Royal Veterinary College.
"The dog was an American pit bull, a prohibited breed under the 1991 Dangerous Dogs Act,"  Chief Inspector Tom Thompson said.
Northamptonshire Police said they had drawn on national expertise in the area of dangerous dogs in its investigation.
"But at the heart of it is a baby girl whose life has tragically been taken away in the most horrific of circumstances," a spokesman said.
"In addition to our ongoing investigation, we have been concentrating our efforts on providing support for a grieving family."
An inquest will be formally opened by the Northamptonshire Coroner on Wednesday 15 October.
Daventry District Council said it received a noise complaint in May about two dogs barking at the house and spoke to the owner "who acted to control the noise".
The Conservative leader of the council, Chris Millar, told BBC Look East a sound monitoring device had been installed and was in place for a "number of months".
