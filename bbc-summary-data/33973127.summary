Plan to expand Union Square shopping centre in Aberdeen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Planning permission is to be sought for a multi-million pound expansion of the Union Square Shopping Centre in Aberdeen.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The complex - which hosts shops, restaurants and a cinema - opened in October 2009 at a cost of Â£275m.
A proposal of application notice has been submitted to Aberdeen City Council.
The plans are for a new retail and leisure space, as well as additional parking and a hotel.
The existing shopping centre would also be expanded.
General Manager Ryan Manson said: "Since opening its doors in 2009, Union Square has firmly established itself not only as a central part of Aberdeen city centre, but also a leading name in Scottish retail.
"We have consistently brought new and exciting brands to customers in the north east and the proposed expansion plans will allow us to continue to do so in future."
