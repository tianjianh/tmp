Aberdeen FC has submitted its planning application for a new stadium on the outskirts of the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The stadium and training facilities would be built at Kingsford, close to the Aberdeen bypass, near Westhill.
The ground would have a capacity of 20,000. The club believes the new stadium is vital if it is to achieve a sustainable future.
However, there has been some protest. Opponents are to deliver information packs to local residents.
In July last year, the Say No To Kingsford Stadium group vowed to continue its campaign despite saying it was facing online abuse.
Aberdeen FC said the club condemned any such abuse.
The Dons had been considering a relocation to Loirston, to the south of Aberdeen, but the proposal was marred by planning difficulties.
Chairman Stewart Milne has described Kingsford as "an ideal location for supporters".
