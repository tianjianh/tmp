Health Secretary Shona Robison has announced extra funding for Scottish health boards' 2016-17 budgets.

She said the additional money totalling more than £500m would take the Scottish government's spending on health to a record level of almost £13bn.
The funding will support the new Edinburgh Royal Hospital for Sick Children and the replacement of Balfour Hospital in Orkney.
Extra money will also go towards the National Blood Transfusion Centre.
About £250m has been allocated to ease the integration of health and social care services.
Among the health boards to receive more funds are NHS Highland and Tayside. Audit Scotland raised concerns about the health boards' finances last year.
How the announcement affects health boards is as follows:
Ms Robinson said the government was committed improving health care.
She said: "People in Scotland should get the care and support they need in the right place, at the right time, which is why we are transforming our health and social care system to make sure it keeps pace with Scotland's changing needs.
"The integration of health and social care, which comes into full force on 1 April, is the most significant reform of our health and social care services since the creation of the NHS and our investment of £250m will help health and social care partnerships improve people's experience of care.
"This funding will allow people to be supported to maintain their independence for as long as possible, in their own homes and communities and mean that fewer people need to go to hospital to receive care.
She added: "Where hospital care is necessary and appropriate, they will spend less time there and return home more quickly."
