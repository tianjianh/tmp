Police said people threw stones at a tram full of passengers near St Werburgh's Road stop, Chorlton, late on Friday.
Transport for Greater Manchester said this damaged the tram and the tracks, with a later tram becoming stuck and blocking the line.
Services on the Manchester Airport and East Didsbury lines were suspended.
No-one was injured during the incident.
There was significant travel disruption on Saturday, with lines since fully reopening. Greater Manchester Police is investigating the incident.
Peter Cushing, Metrolink director, said: "I'm disgusted by the behaviour that we saw and we will be working with the police to help them with their inquiries.
"I'd like to apologise to our passengers for the disruption caused by the vandalism."
