[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-0 Grimsby Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yeovil and Grimsby missed the chance to move into the League Two play-offs with a goalless draw at Huish Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Managerless Grimsby, who lost Paul Hurst to Shrewsbury earlier in the week, enjoyed the better of an uninspiring encounter but were unable to find a winner against a Yeovil side whose unbeaten run stretches to four matches.
The Mariners had an appeal for a penalty in the fourth minute when Omar Bogle went down under the challenge of Darren Ward, but referee Brendan Malone ignored the striker's protests.
Bogle was looking threatening and twice went close, first when he forced Artur Krysiak to palm a long-range drive over the bar and again when he curled an effort wide from just inside the area.
Yeovil's best offering of the first half then came as Ryan Hedges' shot from the edge of the box was blocked.
Grimsby wasted two good chances in the opening exchanges of the second half as James Berrett fired over from 10 yards before Danny Collins headed Luke Summerfield's corner over the bar.
Berrett had the chance to give the Mariners victory with just over 10 minutes remaining, but his long-range effort drew a good stop from Krysiak.
