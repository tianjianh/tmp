Her son, 26-year-old Javid Ahmed, rang 999 to report he had killed his mother.
Ahmed admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at a Chelmsford Crown Court hearing earlier. Prosecutors accepted his plea.
He will be sentenced on 19 September.

Det Insp Danny Stoten said: "The investigation into this incident has established that at the time Ahmed was very unwell and his mental capacity was significantly impaired.
"Members of the public tried to intervene to help Mrs Begum and I would like to thank them for their bravery during what must have been a very frightening incident."
