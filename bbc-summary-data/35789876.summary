Northern Ireland pork industry frustrated by China exports delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The pig industry has expressed its frustration at a delay in getting final approval for the export of £10m a year worth of Northern Ireland pork to China

Provisional approval was granted at the end of November, but there is still no sign of a conclusion to the process.
Producers say they need it at a time when pig prices have taken a slump.
The Department of Agriculture has said it is waiting for the Chinese authorities to make the final decision.
After two years where the pig price was at break-even, it took a sharp dip before Christmas.
Hugh McReynolds, who runs a pig farm near Sion Mills in County Tyrone, says he is losing £5,000 a week.
Mr McReynolds said he is now losing £10 on every pig he produces.
Lower prices are due to cheap imports from the euro zone due to currency differentials.
There is also a glut of pig meat in Europe due to a Russian ban on EU food, part of a sanctions row over Ukraine.
Mr McReynolds said the China deal would provide some relief to pig producers.
He said the industry's expectations "haven't been managed at all" and there was "extreme frustration" over the red tape involved.
Two processing plants had some work to complete before final approval.
That was done and the evidence sent to China in late January.
But by the time it arrived, it had run into the holiday period there associated with Chinese new year.
That is thought to have slowed the approval process.
Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said her officials were working through the Northern Ireland Executive's office in Beijing to close the deal.
