Re-analysis of a sample from Abakumova, 30, resulted in a positive test for the anabolic steroid turinabol.
Abakumova was second, behind the Czech Republic's Barbora Spotakova.
Britain are also set to receive a 4x400m men's relay bronze from the same Games in Beijing because of another Russian doping offence.
Like Abakumova, Denis Alekseyev, 28, tested positive for turinabol.
Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney are the British 400m runners set to benefit.
Steele, who has since retired, said he was "emotional" at hearing the news.
"It's been unofficial for quite a while and we suspected it for even longer, but it's gone so quiet of late I started to suspect it may never come to fruition," he told Athletics Weekly.
"I'm honestly really pleased but also really upset I've not been able to be this pleased for the last eight years."
Rooney, who was also part of the 4x400m team at the recent Rio Games, said on Twitter he was "delighted with the news".
Runner Inga Abitova and cyclist Ekaterina Gnindenko have also been disqualified following more sample re-testing.
Abitova, 34, was sixth in the 10,000m at the 2008 Games, while Gnindenko, 23, came eighth in the keirin at the 2012 Olympics in London.
