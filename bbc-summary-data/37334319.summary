[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said they were called to reports of a body at a property in Templehill in Troon at 17:15 BST on Saturday.
Jonathan Adair junior, who was 32, had recently been released from prison.
Officers said they were treating the death as unexplained and a post-mortem examination would be carried out. A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.
Jonathan Adair's father, Johnny Adair, is a former leader of the outlawed Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF).
The family was forced to flee Northern Ireland in 2003 after a series of murders linked to a loyalist feud.
When he was 18 and still living in Northern Ireland, Jonathan Adair was shot in both legs in the loyalist lower Shankill area of west Belfast.
