Louis van Gaal: Manchester United manager in bizarre post-match interview

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United's football under Louis van Gaal may have been called dull at times, but his interviews have been anything but, continuing with his bizarre description of Marouane Fellaini's clash with Robert Huth.

The Dutchman - who has called a journalist a "fat man",slapped another and called one of his players the wrong name - offered to pull BBC Sport interviewer Manish Bhasin's hair and likened Huth's antics to a sex act.
The issue that riled the Dutchman was when the Leicester defender pulled Fellaini's hair in Sunday's 1-1 draw, with Fellaini elbowing him in retaliation. Both men escaped punishment.
"When I grab you by the hair, what are you doing? Shall I do it? It's also a penalty," he told our man at Old Trafford, before continuing: "When I grab your hair, you react also. I know for sure."
When asked if Fellaini should have been sent off, he said: "No, I don't think so. It's not in the books that someone has to grab by the hair and then pull it behind - only in sex masochism."
In his Sky Sports interview - and again in his news conference - he also offered to pull journalists' hair.
"Fellaini is reacting like a human being because when I grab you with your hair and pull it backwards, you shall do also something to me, I believe."
The Belgian avoided punishment, but could potentially face a three-game Premier League ban if he is charged with violent conduct by the Football Association.
Tottenham's Dele Alli recently received such a suspension for a punch on West Brom's Claudio Yacob that was not spotted by the referee at the time.
Former England captain Alan Shearer on BBC Radio 5 live: "Marouane Fellaini will get reported to the FA. If you compare that to Dele Alli then he will get banned."
Ex-Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage: "Marouane Fellaini was lucky to still be on the pitch. He has swung his arm back and caught Robert Huth around the neck area. It was six of one and half a dozen of the other but that is very dangerous play."
