The murder of a transgender woman, believed to have been working as an escort in London, has prompted Scotland Yard to appeal to Spanish speakers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vanessa Santillan, 33, was found dead with head and neck injuries in Romily Court, Fulham on 28 March following a night out in the West End with friends.
The Metropolitan Police said Ms Santillan had arrived from her native Mexico in January.
Anyone with information is being urged to email OpLarbreck@met.police.uk.
The Met said Galop, London's LGBT anti-violence and abuse charity, was also involved in the case.
It said people could Skype 'galop london' with information and an interpreter would be provided.
Det Ch Insp Rebecca Reeves said: "Vanessa's parents are devastated by the loss of their daughter. She last spoke to them on Friday, 27 March.
"Later that evening, she met up with a small group of friends and went out to the West End, returning home in the early hours of Saturday.
"I need to hear from anyone who saw Vanessa on Saturday 28 March or spoke to her, and anyone who met her while she was in London."
The Met said a 23-year-old man arrested in connection with her death had been bailed until May.
