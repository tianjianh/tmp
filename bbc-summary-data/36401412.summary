[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old made 38 appearances for the Silkmen last season after joining from Southport in September 2015.
He told the club website: "The gaffer had a huge influence on me signing on for next season.
"He kept faith in me all last season and I think from the work that was done last year my defending has improved a lot."
