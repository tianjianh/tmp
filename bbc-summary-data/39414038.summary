Johnson returns to the fold having become a father, after his girlfriend gave birth to a baby girl.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson will give captain Gary O'Neil chance to prove his fitness, after he tweaked his knee in Saturday's defeat by Brentford.
Johnson also said he could make changes after the loss, but confirmed there are no other major doubts.
Bristol City head coach Lee Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol:
"We have got to make sure that our big players turn up and put in good performances.
"They [Preston] have flaws and weaknesses like all clubs in the Championship and we can only exploit them if we are at it.
"We have to make sure that everything we do is positive and on the front foot. We have to be the best team on the day."
