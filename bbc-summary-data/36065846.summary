The 19-year-old played the last eight holes in six under par, chipping in for an eagle at the 13th on the way to a bogey-free, eight under par 64.
Lee's 16 under par total was one better than South Korea's Chun In-gee and American Katie Burnett, who had led overnight in Hawaii.
"I just did all I could do and here I am," said world number 17 Lee.
Lee, who won her first LPGA title last May at the Kingsmill Championship, added: "This is definitely a big confidence booster. The last couple of weeks I was there, but not quite. Now my game seems to be coming together and that's quite nice."
