Kirkcudbright art gallery plan seeks extra funding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A further funding commitment is being sought to allow £3.1m plans for a major art gallery project in Kirkcudbright to proceed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme would see the town hall converted to house "nationally significant" collections.
The Kirkcudbright Common Good Fund is being asked to agree to support the project with up to £200,000.
The money would allow the creation of a second floor gallery to host a hoard of Viking treasure found in the region.
