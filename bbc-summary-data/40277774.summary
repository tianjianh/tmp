[SN]TITLE[SN]
Operation could have prevented Cornwall granddad's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A grandfather died from a condition that should have been straightforward to treat, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Terrence George, 72, died in January 2016 at the Royal Cornwall Hospital after an attack of pancreatitis caused by gall stones.
He was admitted to hospital with mild pancreatitis five months before, but had not had his gall bladder removed.
He was discharged a week later with a plan for him to be reviewed after six weeks, but there were delays.
Senior Coroner for Cornwall, Dr Emma Carlyon, read a statement from Melanie Feldman, a consultant colorectal surgeon who was responsible for Mr George's care until discharge in August 2015.
She was asked: "Do you agree that death could have been avoided in this case if an earlier operation had taken place?"
In a written response Mrs Feldman said "yes".
The court heard a statement from Mr George's son Kevin George, who said his father had "led a full and active life".
In describing his father's death he said "devastating is a huge understatement".
He said it was a "tragic waste of life" and a "simple operation could have prevented it".
The inquest continues.
