Cameron Steel's maiden first-class hundred (128) and contributions from Paul Collingwood (54) and Ryan Pringle (47 not out) helped Durham make 376.
But Azharullah's 5-72 set up a fourth-innings chase of 205 for Northants to pick up a third win of the season.
The visitors lost Max Holden third ball, but Rob Newton and Alex Wakeley made it to stumps safely on 44-1.
Durham began day three 94 runs behind on 78-1, losing three quick wickets as Rory Kleinveldt (2-103) dismissed Barry McCarthy and Graham Clark to leave them 98-4.
Steel responded, hitting 14 fours and two sixes before Collingwood and Pringle gave Division Two's bottom side a total to try and defend against unbeaten Northants on day four.
