The parade also commemorates Yeovilton's 75th birthday and is in recognition of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War Two.
Platoons from HMS Heron, led by the Queen's Colours and the Band of the Royal Marines, marched before Yeovil mayor Mike Lock.
There was also a flypast representing all the squadrons based at Yeovilton.
Lieutenant Commander Chris Gray said the freedom of Yeovil was granted to the base in 1962 and the parade "reinforces our bond and close links" with the town.
