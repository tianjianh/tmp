A fresh appeal has been launched into the disappearance of two boys who were last seen alive 20 years ago.

Patrick Warren, 11, and David Spencer, 13, vanished on 26 December 1996.
The pair were spotted at a petrol station close to their homes in Chelmsley Wood, near Birmingham, just after midnight.
At a press conference earlier, David's brother Lee O'Toole said his family wanted closure.
He said: "David was my backbone. If I needed anything I would go to him. I looked up to him like a role model.
"I'm convinced someone out there knows what happened. I am begging them to come forward."
West Midlands Police launched a missing persons investigation after Patrick - known as Paddy - and David failed to return home.
Despite a number of searches and appeals, the boys have never been found.
In 2006, child killer Brian Field, who was jailed in 2001 for the murder of schoolboy Roy Tutill, was questioned by officers in connection with the case but never charged.
Det Ch Insp Caroline Marsh, from the force's homicide team, said the case will never close.
She said: "I do believe that the boys are deceased and something very serious must have happened to them.
"If the boys were murdered someone knows who is responsible for that and I appeal to anyone with information to come forward."
