The 33-year-old former Leeds United, Manchester United and Newcastle United man, who started his career as a striker but now plays in midfield, will also take on a coaching role.
Smith, capped 19 times by England, was not offered new terms by MK Dons for next season.
He told BBC East Midlands Today: "I'll bring a drive to succeed at all costs."

The former Leeds academy product started 18 games for MK Dons last season and made 11 substitute appearances.
He is relishing the chance to play for manager Shaun Derry.
"We seem to get on as people," Smith said. "We are both very honest. We are both very passionate and committed to what we do, and when the opportunity came I jumped at the chance.
"We are trying to create an environment that breeds a winning mentality."
Derry is convinced Smith, who has played 498 domestic games and scored 71 goals during a 15-year, four-club career, will have a huge impact on the dressing room.
"I am absolutely delighted," Derry told BBC Radio Nottingham. "Everyone is aware of what he is as a player and where he has been and the fantastic clubs he has been at.
"But he is not just joining to be a player who can produce the performances, he will be a fantastic influence in the dressing room - which is where I felt we struggled."
