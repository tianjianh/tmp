A British-Iraqi man accused of smuggling hundreds of migrants into the UK is set to be extradited to France.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rekawt Kayani, 34, was apprehended on a European arrest warrant at his home in Normanton, Derby, in May.
He is facing trafficking charges including facilitating the entry of migrants, which could see him jailed for 10 years.
The 34-year-old was one of three men detained as part of a joint investigation with French authorities.
The other two men - a 29-year-old from Derby and a 32-year-old from Gillingham - have since been released on bail.
District Judge Vanessa Baraitser told the hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court she rejected three issues raised by his defence.
She said: "In light of the serious nature of the allegations, I have taken the view that extradition would not be disproportionate."
It is alleged Rekawt Kayani organised numerous smuggling runs, including one in June 2015 when 68 migrants were found inside four lorries at Harwich International Port in Essex.
Thirty-five of the migrants were from Afghanistan, 22 from China, 10 from Vietnam and one was from Russia.
The National Crime Agency (NCA) also believes he orchestrated runs from Dieppe in France to Newhaven, East Sussex.
