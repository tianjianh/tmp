Devon and Somerset firefighters consider cost-cutting police alliance

Firefighters could form an alliance with police officers across south west England in a bid to save money, the BBC has learned.

Proposals are being considered for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service to share some services with police in Dorset and Devon & Cornwall.
Chief Fire Officer Lee Howell described the plans as a "key part of our plan to deal with austerity".
The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said the alliance could undermine public trust.
Dorset and Devon & Cornwall Police formed a cost-cutting alliance last year.
The latest move could see the fire service selling its headquarters in Exeter and moving into the Devon & Cornwall police site in the city.
Fire crews and police might also share facilities in locations such as Crownhill, Plymouth, where both services currently have stations close together.
Backroom functions such as information technology and personnel could also be combined.
This would be a significant strategic move in joining up the work of the police and fire services across the south west of England.
The government has said it wants to see Britain's emergency services working more closely together to achieve savings, and there's already co-operation between the fire and ambulance services in their day-to-day work.
But policing is an area which can involve considerable conflict, which is why this proposed alliance between the fire service and the police is proving controversial.
Bob Walker, chair of the FBU in Devon and Somerset, said: "We're worried about the potential damage to public trust in firefighters.
"Although we face cuts and the alliance is an obvious place to look for savings, we are a life-saving service, not law enforcement, and don't want to risk being seen that way."
Mr Howell, Chief Fire Officer at Devon and Somerset, said: "I don't think this will undermine trust, as the public won't see any difference to our life-saving work.
"But it's a key part of our plan to deal with austerity and could mean big savings for us".
"Discussions are at an early stage but we are committed to the principle of the alliance."
