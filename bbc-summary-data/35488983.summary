[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world number four Juan Martin del Potro will make his comeback at Delray Beach on 15 February after almost a year out with a wrist injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old Argentine, who won the US Open in 2009, last played at Miami in March.
He has had wrist surgery three times since 2010, the third time in June 2015, and asked fans not to expect too much immediately after his comeback.
"I know you are anxious to see me play, but I ask you for patience," he said.
