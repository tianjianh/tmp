It will mark the 75th anniversary of their debut performance as a double act at Liverpool's Empire Theatre in 1941.
The 8ft bronzed sculpture has been designed by Graham Ibbeson, who made the statue of Eric in the comedian's hometown of Morecambe in 1999.
Eric's widow Joan said: "It will be a day that will live with us forever."
Speaking on behalf of herself and Wise's widow Doreen, she added: "We never dreamt of seeing a statue unveiled to both Eric and Ernie in Blackpool, a town that we have so many happy memories of from all the many shows the boys performed there over the years."
The comedians appeared in more than 1,000 shows in the seaside town.
Mr Ibbeson said: "I am delighted to have brought the boys back together so the nation can see them as they should be - Eric and Ernie alongside one another."
The Â£75,000 statue, which has been funded by donations, will be unveiled at Blackpool's Winter Gardens on 14 October.
In 2014, the sculpture of Eric in Morecambe was reinstalled after a man tried to saw off one of its legs.
A statue of Ernie was unveiled in his Yorkshire hometown of Morley in 2010.
