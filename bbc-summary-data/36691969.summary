Australian Day birdied the 16th and 17th holes but bogeyed the 18th to reach halfway on four under par.
Sweden's David Lingmerth also dropped a shot at the last but his three-under 67 lifted him up to second.
World number two Jordan Spieth is one under after a one-over 71 while England's Paul Casey (72) is two over.
"It was one of those days where you had to stay patient," said Day, who is bidding for a fourth PGA Tour win this season. "I'm just very pleased to shoot under par."
