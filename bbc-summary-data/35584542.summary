Rob Ramshaw hit the post from 10-yards out as the Heed had the better of the early chances.
The visitors went close to opening the scoring after the break when Ryan Bowman's header was cleared off the line by Kyle Storer.

Cheltenham Town boss Gary Johnson told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:
"It was a dull game, a boring game, I don't like to use that word, but I thought it was dead.
"I thought the pitch was dead, I thought the supporters were dead and I thought the players were dead as well."
"There was no real quality in the game and Gateshead had the better chances.
"It feels like a loss, but it wasn't - and we're hoping that this is a punch on the nose for the lads and we come out fighting."
