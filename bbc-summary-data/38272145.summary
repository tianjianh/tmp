Barnet 1-2 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet lost for the first time in nine games as they were beaten at home by local rivals Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Akinde's penalty early in the second half cancelled out Dale Gorman's opener for Stevenage, but Luke Wilkinson fired the visitors' winner.
Stevenage were much the better side in the opening 20 minutes, but an unmarked Rowan Liburd could only head over from 10 yards.
The visitors took a 39th-minute lead they fully deserved, Matt Godden finding Gorman, who claimed his first senior goal with a brilliant curling strike.
Interim Bees boss Rossi Eames made two changes at half-time, but it was talisman Akinde who grabbed his 16th of the season from the penalty spot in the 47th minute after Fraser Franks had brought him down.
But Franks made up for the mistake 14 minutes later, heading the ball down to fellow centre-half Wilkinson, who half-volleyed in from 12 yards.
Michael Tonge hit a post with a fine free-kick, but it mattered not as Barnet were unable to muster a late equaliser despite five minutes of added time.
