Police probe as turf stolen from graves in cemetery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are investigating after newly laid turf was stolen from a number of graves at Camelon cemetery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thieves struck after maintenance workers laid new turf on 10 graves in an older part of the cemetery.
Officers believe the most recent of the thefts happened between 16:00 on Thursday and 11:00 on Friday and have appealed for information.
Insp Derek Easton, of Police Scotland, said thieves had shown a "lack of respect" for the dead.
He said: "Although the turf was only worth around Â£40, we are treating it as a serious matter given the location of the crime and the lack of respect shown for those buried in the cemetery."
