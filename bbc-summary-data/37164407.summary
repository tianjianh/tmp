[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameroon coach Hugo Broos says he will combine experimentation with a need to win in his side's final Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Gambia.

His side top Group M with 11 points and have already qualified for Gabon 2017.
The Belgian coach is looking to extend the Indomitable Lions' good run against bottom-of-the-group Gambia on 3 September and against the Nations Cup hosts three days later.
"I want to win, I like victory," Broos said.
"We are already in a comfortable position because the big work has been done.
"This gives me an opportunity to use players who have not played much before and experiment with new players."
Regular starters such as Nicolas Nkoulou, Eyong Enoh, Zoua Jacques, Aurelien Chedjou and Stephane Mbia will be absent for the September games and Broos explained that he called each player to explain that they would not be needed.
Among the players in line for their first cap is Robert Ndip Tambe of Slovak Super Liga side Spartak Trnava, who has played 15 league games and scored three goals so far this season.
"We are always on the look-out to find new and good players and build a new team, for now and next year," Broos said.
"We saw Ndip Tambe at his club. He scored four goals in five games and it was very interesting. I want to see him here.
"We also called up four local players because of their qualities. Maybe after the game I can conclude my standards are very high and we will have a good team."
The locally-based players in the 23-man squad include Moise Pouaty and Olivier Mbaizo of Union de Douala, Aaron Mbimbe of Coton Sport Garoua and Franck Boya of Apejes de Mfou.
Broos emphasised the need for victory against Gambia in Limbe, particularly to appease fans, after results like the 2-2 draw at home to South Africa in March.
The 63-year-old also wants to improve Cameroon's standing in the Fifa rankings and upcoming finals draws.
"I was surprise and disappointed to see Cameroon in the third pot [for the World Cup qualifiers]," he said.
"Cameroon is not a country to be in the third pot, but rather in the first."
Another player included in the squad, goalkeeper Andre Onana, made his debut for Dutch giants Ajax, as they lost 2-1 to Willem II on Saturday.

Goalkeepers:  Fabrice Ondoa (FC Seville), Andre Onana (Ajax Amsterdam), Moise Pouaty (Union de Douala)
