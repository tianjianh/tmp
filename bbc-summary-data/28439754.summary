Lawyers for Adele's two-year-old son, Angelo Adkins, have accepted a five-figure sum in damages to settle a privacy case over paparazzi photos.

Adele and her partner, Simon Konecki, brought the case against photo agency Corbis Images UK Limited over pictures of the child's "milestone moments".
The agency has agreed to pay damages and legal costs and has, in addition, agreed not to use the photos again.
The photos of Angelo with the singer were taken in June and November 2013.
Corbis Images UK Limited, trading as Splash News and Picture Agency, made them available for publishing in the English press.
Adele's solicitor, Jenny Afia, told the High Court in London that the singer was emphatic that her son was not and must never be public property.
"It is a matter of profound sadness that many of his milestone moments, such as his first family outing and his first trip to playgroup, were photographed and published worldwide expressly against his family's wishes," said Ms Afia.
"These images were taken during private, recreational time unconnected with professional or public engagements. They represent a clear infringement of our client's right to privacy."
Ms Afia also stated it was Adele and Konecki's view that "these images were of routine, everyday family occasions which the paparazzi has no right to intrude upon, profit from and file away in picture libraries for future reference and use".
Regarding the payout, Ms Afia confirmed the couple would be "holding the damages on trust".
She added they would "continue to do all they can to protect Angelo's rights in relation to the paparazzi, including taking legal action where necessary".
"They will also continue efforts to improve the laws relating to paparazzi and children generally, building on the successful campaign Adele helped fund in California resulting in far stricter harassment laws."
Ms Afia also said legal firm Schillings had been in contact with the freelance photographers who took the shots to explain that legal action would be taken if they photographed Angelo Adkins again in this way.
