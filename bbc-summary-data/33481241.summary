Up to 50 jobs could be lost at Reading Borough Council as its budget is reduced by £39m until 2019.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The voluntary sector could face reductions of 45%, libraries could be closed and charges for parking permits will be increased as part of the cuts, the Labour-run council said.
It said it would have made £110m worth of savings since 2011.
Council leader Tony Page said local government had trimmed the fat and now faced having "its limbs amputated".
No details have been released about which departments could cut jobs.
Adult social care also faces being cut.
Reading Borough Council said residents' first parking permit would remain free but the cost of a household's second permit would increase from £80 to £120 and the cost of the third would go up from £160 to £240.
The authority's net annual budget for the year 2019 will be £83 million.
