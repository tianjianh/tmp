The party of President-elect Muhammadu Buhari has accused the outgoing government of "sabotage" as it is failing to deal with the crisis.
The shortage, which has been going on for more than a month, means that Africa's biggest economy is slowly grinding to halt, says the BBC's Will Ross in Lagos.
You have been showing us what is going on in Nigeria via Twitter and WhatsApp.
"The queues at fuel stations are terrible and fuel prices are rising hourly.
Fuel stations get the oil overnight at 1am when people are sleeping. I don't know how they get it. There are massive queues in the morning as soon as people wake up.
There is no power at the moment either."
"A lot of people are going behind closed doors to buy fuel. The prices are not the problem now, it is actually getting the fuel.
It is very difficult to get to work. We have to walk to work, but that's not possible for me as it's too far.
This crisis has been going on for three weeks but has now reached a critical situation"
"It's a very terrible situation. Everything in Nigeria is shutting down.
The prices of every commodity are rising. It's been like this for the last couple of weeks.
It's the government's fault. The government should be paying more attention to creating more refineries"
Francis filmed these scenes of people looking for petrol and sent it to us via WhatsApp.
"It's a very, very critical situation. I would say a national security crisis.
There is no fuel and no light. I cannot power my business premises now. We are threatening to call a workers' strike in Nigeria.
Nigerians now depend on the black market to survive. The illegal gas sellers get constant supply but we have empty gas stations.
I am saving the little diesel for evening when it will be dark."
The fuel crisis has been trending on Twitter for most of the morning. Some of the most popular words on Twitter have been: GTBank, Capital Oil, scarcity, #fuelscarcity, outages and fuel.
