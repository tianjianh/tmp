Gabriel: Arsenal defender wins appeal against red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal's appeal against defender Gabriel's red card during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea has been successful.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gabriel, 24, was sent off by referee Mike Dean for violent conduct after a clash with Diego Costa during the Blues' 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge.
The successful appeal means he will now not serve a three-match suspension.
The Brazilian is subject to a separate Football Association charge of improper conduct to which he has until 18:00 BST on Thursday to respond.
That relates to him failing to leave the pitch immediately after being sent off.
Chelsea striker Costa, meanwhile, was found guilty of violent conduct and banned for three matches following a clash with Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny.
