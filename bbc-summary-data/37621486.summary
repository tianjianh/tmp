Mosquitoes by Lucy Kirkwood will have its world premiere in the Dorfman Theatre in July 2017.
The NT's artistic director Rufus Norris said he had persuaded the Broadchurch and Night Manager actress back to the stage over a coffee.
"I'm totally thrilled that she'll be coming and joining us," he said.
Announcing the theatre's 2017 plans, Norris said the play centred around two sisters - one of whom is a leading scientist at the opening of the Large Hadron Collider.
Colman's last appearance at the National Theatre was in Richard Bean's England People Very Nice in 2009.
Norris, who will also direct the play, last worked with Colman on his film version of the musical London Road.
"Since then I've been trying to woo her back into the theatre," he said. "I had a coffee with her not long ago and managed to trick her into stepping back over the line.
"She's a fantastic asset to our creative industries," Norris added.
"When actors get that kind of success in television and film, before you know it you can have five or 10 years going by without them being on stage.
"So it's important to get those people back in and to keep that side of the craft up."
Other big names appearing at the National Theatre in 2017 include Imelda Staunton in Stephen Sondheim's Follies and Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield in Tony Kushner's Angels in America.
