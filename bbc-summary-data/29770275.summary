Hereford United promises new investor deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hereford United has promised a new investor will be brought in before the next court hearing into unpaid debts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club paid off outstanding rents and legal fees to Herefordshire Council on Friday after it launched repossession proceedings.
A high court petition calling for the club to be wound up was adjourned for six weeks on Monday.
Club chairman Andy Lonsdale said a new investor and sponsor would be named within three weeks.
"We're trying to resolve the problems we've inherited as best we can and as quick as we can," he said.
"We've got investment. If we didn't, we wouldn't have invested Â£500,000 to Â£600,000 in Hereford United.
"The investment isn't signed and sealed yet. It will be within two to three weeks.
"The name will be known and the sponsor will be on the shirts."
Its landlord, Herefordshire Council, launched legal proceedings to repossess the Edgar Street ground after a failed bid to gain access on Thursday evening.
It said it had taken the action after Monday's winding up petition was adjourned for a seventh time in the high court.
The council joined HM Revenue and Customs on the petition in September.
Despite the payment, the council said it was continuing to consult with its legal team
Hereford United was thrown out of the football conference in June over unpaid debts and now plays in the Southern Premier League.
Mr Lonsdale said the club would be in a stronger position if a Company Voluntary Agreement had not been rejected in August and added it was "wholly committed" to playing football at Edgar Street.
