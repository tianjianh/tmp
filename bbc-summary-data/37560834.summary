Profile: Alliance Party's David Ford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Ford, who is resigning as leader of Alliance, had led the cross-community Alliance party since 2001.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was the seventh leader of the party, which was formed in 1970, and its longest serving.
He took over after Sean Neeson resigned in the face of poor election results.
Mr Ford also held the post of Northern Ireland justice minister between 2010 and 2016 - the first local minister in that role in nearly 40 years.
Following May's assembly elections, Alliance said it would not take up the justice ministry after party recommendations - which Mr Ford said "would have moved Northern Ireland forward and created a better society for all" - were "rejected by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in".
Independent MLA Claire Sugden subsequently took the post.
While Alliance did not have enough seats to formally join the opposition with the Ulster Unionists and SDLP, it currently sits on the opposition benches and Mr Ford has since been critical of the DUP-Sinn Fein administration at Stormont, particularly what he says is a "lack of openness and transparency".
Mr Ford, a 65-year-old father of four, has represented South Antrim as an MLA since 1998. He was also a member of Antrim Borough Council.
Born in Kent, with a Welsh father and a mother from Northern Ireland, he grew up in England, but spent summer holidays on his uncle's farm in Gortin, County Tyrone.
He moved to Northern Ireland permanently in 1969 and studied economics at Queen's University in Belfast.
A former social worker, he joined Alliance at university and spent a year as a volunteer at the ecumenical centre, Corrymeela.
Mr Ford's entry into full-time politics was in 1990 when he became Alliance's general secretary. He was appointed party chief whip in 1998.
The party's share of the vote has increased in assembly, general, local and European elections since he became leader in 2001.
When the then Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble lost his assembly majority in 2001, Mr Ford redesignated as a unionist with two colleagues for 22 minutes.
This helped pave the way for Mr Trimble to get re-elected as first minister of Northern Ireland.
At the time, Mr Ford said he would never again allow himself to be what he described as the "back-end of a pantomime horse".
In February, MLAs voted against a proposed change to Northern Ireland's abortion legislation brought forward by Mr Ford.
The change would have legalised abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
His party also voted to endorse gay marriage in 2012.
Amid the ensuing controversy, Mr Ford stepped aside temporarily as an elder at his Presbyterian church in County Antrim.
Mr Ford's leadership saw the party win a Westminster seat in East Belfast and gain two ministerial seats in the last power-sharing executive.
However, Alliance activists also suffered intimidation during the Belfast union flag dispute and lost their Westminster seat and their ministerial places after elections during the past two years.
In March, Mr Ford said there were several people within the Alliance Party who could succeed him as leader.
Addressing the annual party conference in Belfast, he praised the work of his deputy, Naomi Long.
Mr Ford has made it clear he intends to remain as an MLA pursuing his interests in justice and environmental matters.
