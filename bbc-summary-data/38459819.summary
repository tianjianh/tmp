Olivia Watling, a 15-year-old student at Ramsey Grammar School, was admitted to Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital last month.
Her friends are trying to contact the group in the hope they will send her a  message.
Olivia's aunt Andrea Holroyd told the BBC a message would "mean the world".
She added: "Liv went to see Little Mix last year, she knows all the songs and all the dances so to have a message from the band would really give her a boost.
"I can't tell you how amazing Liv is - she is in so much pain but she is so incredibly strong and brave. We are just finding things to lift her spirits."
Olivia, who has been unconscious since 24 December, is currently undergoing chemotherapy.
The Facebook group, called Contact Little Mix for Liv has so far attracted the attention of comedian Dawn French, television presenter Davina McCall and TT racing star Ian Hutchinson.
