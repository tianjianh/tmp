George Kruis: Saracens star backed to succeed for British & Irish Lions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Kruis is the kind of forward the British and Irish Lions need in New Zealand - according to his director of rugby at Saracens Mark McCall.

The 27-year-old England second row is tipped to be included in the Lions squad, which is named on Wednesday.
"He's up there in terms of line-out intelligence, but he brings more than that," McCall told BBC 5 live.
"He is relentless with his workrate and he is definitely the kind of forward the Lions are going to need out there."
Kruis, who made his return from a knee injury last weekend, is one of a number of Saracens players expected to be included in the Lions party.
England internationals Mako and Billy Vunipola, Jamie George, Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell are all near-certainties for selection, while Scotland pair Sean Maitland and Duncan Taylor are among those in contention.
"We hope the people that are expecting to get a call-up get a call-up," McCall added.
"If they don't, I know they will just crack on, but there is going to be some disappointment there for sure.
"We just have to deal with that when it comes."
McCall also confirmed prop Mako Vunipola would be "100% fine" for Saturday's Champions Cup semi-final with Munster in Dublin, after being rested for the Premiership victory over Northampton.
