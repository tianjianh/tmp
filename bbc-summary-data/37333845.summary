Pamela Gower, 49, of Hebburn, South Tyneside, was found on Saturday in a road close to the airfield at Shotton Colliery where her plane had taken off.
It had been thought her parachute failed to open, but it has now emerged her reserve parachute did deploy.
Miss Gower's parents Catherine and Len said she would be "hugely missed".
The death is being investigated by the British Parachuting Association (BPA), Durham Police and the Civil Aviation Authority.
In a statement released by Durham Police, Mr and Mrs Gower said: "Pamela was a great girl who was loved by her family so much and was a wonderful daughter and sister.
"Pamela was a very determined and independent woman who let nothing get in her way.
"It was lovely to hear the warm messages from everyone and we would like to thank people for sending us their kind words.
"We would also like to thank all those who were involved in trying to help Pamela, from the nurse and the ex-soldier who were first on the scene to the various agencies who tried to save Pamela, including the police, ambulance service, paramedics and the hospital.
"As a family we are devastated at this very difficult time and would appreciate privacy to grieve in peace."
Miss Gower, who had dwarfism, was an employment advisor at Remploy's Newcastle branch and supported disabled people into work.
A Remploy spokesman said: "We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Pam's tragic accident.
"She had worked for the company for many years and was a valued and respected member of the Remploy team."
The coroner has been informed and a post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.
It is understood residents tried to save Ms Gower after she landed close to a parked car at about 15:45 BST.
Durham Police said it had now been established that Miss Gower's reserve parachute did deploy.
