The five-hour questioning at his Jerusalem home followed a slightly shorter session on Monday.
The PM is being investigated for allegedly accepting "improper gifts" worth thousands of dollars from businessmen, media say.
Mr Netanyahu has continually and strongly denied any wrongdoing.
Police said Thursday's questioning had also included a separate matter but gave no details and Mr Netanyahu's office has not commented.
Ahead of the first questioning on Monday, Mr Netanyahu had restated he was innocent and warned the media and political rivals that they should "hold off partying", adding: "Nothing will happen, because there is nothing."
Mr Netanyahu told his Likud party legislators earlier on Monday: "We hear all the media reports. We see and hear the festive spirit and atmosphere in television studios and in the corridors of the opposition.
"I want to tell them to wait for the celebrations. Do not rush... You will continue to inflate hot air balloons and we will continue to lead the state of Israel."
Opponents of Mr Netanyahu have called for an investigation into his affairs following a series of scandals in recent months - none of which has resulted in charges.
