[SN]TITLE[SN]
Raith Rovers 4-3 St Mirren

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Hardie scored a hat-trick as Raith bounced back from Tuesday's defeat by Rangers with a home win over St Mirren.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He sprung the offside trap to slot past Jamie Langfield, then teed up Mark Stewart for Raith's second before Keith Watson headed in for St Mirren.
Hardie scored twice in three second-half minutes to put Raith in command.
But David Clarkson's low shot pulled one back for the Buddies before Watson set up a nervy finish with a nice turn and finish in the 76th minute.
