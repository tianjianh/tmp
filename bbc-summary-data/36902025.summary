The driver was not injured and it is believed a second lorry was involved but did not stop, West Mercia Police said.
The A41 at Shakeford, near Hinstock, was closed earlier.
The owners of the house have spent the past year renovating the Grade II listed building but decided not to stay there on Tuesday night.
They are said to be devastated by the damage.
Earlier Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service said the section between Chester Road and Hatton Road would be closed while crews worked to secure the building.
The badly damaged house is opposite a field which often has a smiley face cut into the grass.
