Llanfair Clydogau 'split' after village bridge collapses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A village in Ceredigion has been "split in two" following a partial collapse of a historical bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bridge connecting Llanfair Clydogau, near Lampeter, has been closed after part of it gave way at the weekend.
It has left residents with an eight-mile (13km) detour - a 25-minute journey - to the shop and post office.
Residents said it had caused "havoc" in the village. Ceredigion council said reopening the bridge was a "priority".
Frustrated resident Colin Adams said: "The shops are on this side, but the majority of people live on the other side of the village. They can't get across."
Community councillor Alan Leech said it was a "major problem" for the village.
"We want action very quickly indeed because the inconvenience to people is substantial," he said.
"And of course there are cost implications for ordinary people here because everyone wishing to get to the shop is having to drive round a detour...which is wasteful of time, wasteful of fuel."
"What we want to know is, what is the county council going to do about this and how quickly is it going to be put right?"
Ceredigion council said engineers had inspected the bridge, which is listed, and it would liaise with conservation body Cadw on when it could reopen.
