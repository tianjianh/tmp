Leicester Tigers assistant coach Geordan Murphy says victory in Sunday's Anglo-Welsh Cup final against Exeter would be a big boost for their Premiership play-off aspirations.

Tigers are fifth after a season of struggle which has seen them sack director of rugby Richard Cockerill.
They are in danger of missing out on a top-four finish in the league for the first time since the 2003-04 season.
"There's a lot more to come from this team," Murphy told BBC Leicester Sport.
"Hopefully the Anglo-Welsh Cup can be the catalyst to kick on in the Premiership. There is a long way to go in the season.
"I am confident we can make the top four and challenge when everyone is looking around and saying 'what are you doing here?' We can answer that emphatically."
Tigers are a point behind fourth-placed Bath with five games remaining, but 11 adrift of Saracens who are third.
They have lost seven of their 17 matches, but welcome respite has come in the Anglo-Welsh Cup where they beat Saracens 32-10 in Saturday's semi-final.
Murphy, who is part of Aaron Mauger's backroom set-up and has been on the coaching team since retiring in 2013 after 16 seasons as a Tigers player, has taken on a leading role in this season's competition.
The 38-year-old said the players fully deserved their place in the final at Twickenham Stoop.
"A lot of people have been saying, 'Hold on a second. How did you guys get here? That wasn't in the script'," he said.
"We have been really good so far in the competition. We have picked some young guys, some inexperienced guys and some players who haven't had a lot of field time.
"We have developed a hell of a lot. We have had different styles of wins. Our opening win against Bath was really tenacious; we had to dig in and fight for everything and we won by a point.
"We had a good win against Newport at home where we put some scores on and played more attractive rugby. And we had a tight win against Saints.
"We went away to Saracens in the pool stages and lost, but the most impressive thing for me was that we learned the lessons from that game. We went back down there at the weekend and executed a game plan and got into the final. Our forwards had a great game.
"The consistent thing from the players who have taken the field is they have been really passionate and have worked hard for each other.
"One of the things we have asked of them is to be able look at each other at the end of the game and know they have given it absolutely everything. So far that has been the case."
