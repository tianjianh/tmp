[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alistair Cooke, 22, who studied at Durham University, denies raping a woman after a house party in June 2015.
The third-year geography student, from Perranarworthal, Cornwall, is said to have followed the woman home.
He found her sleeping on a couch before taking her to bed, Durham Crown Court was told.
Cooke was a volunteer with the Nightline student listening service and during his training he role-played being accused of raping a drunken woman after following her home, Durham Crown Court heard.
Words he used in response to being accused of raping the woman were said to be similar to those he used during the training session with the volunteer service.
The complainant, who gave evidence from behind a screen in the witness box, has accused Cooke of raping her when she was "very drunk".
She told the jury she can only remember him putting on a condom.
Two days after the alleged rape, the woman texted Cooke saying: "You hurt me."
As part of a series of text messages which followed, he told her: "At the time I definitely was not in a clear state of mind but never felt I got any signals (from) you that it was wrong.
"Now I feel shady and more in the grey and that makes me worried and a bit sick."
Later on the day she alleged she was raped, the woman texted a friend to ask how drunk she had been at the party.
The friend replied that the woman had been unable to walk or have a coherent conversation, the jury was told.
The trial continues.
