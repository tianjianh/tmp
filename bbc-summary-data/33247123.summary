Cara Delevingne: 'The best revenge is being happy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cara Delevingne made the wrong sort of headlines recently when an awkward television interview went viral. Here's how we found the model turned actress when we met to discuss her new film Paper Towns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
I am sitting in a corridor in a London hotel when Cara Delevingne - internationally recognised supermodel, budding actress and ubiquitous tabloid darling - totters past me on vertiginous stiletto heels.
Perched on her head is a roll of brown wrapping paper that has been fashioned into a makeshift crown, its exterior adorned with glitter and the kind of adhesive stars teachers use to reward diligent pupils.
Cara pops her head, crown and all, into a suite where two American colleagues are housed, before vanishing into another suite bearing the legend "CD UK".
As calm returns to this corner of one of the English capital's most exclusive hotels, it occurs to me that I have just been treated to my very own fashion show.
Later, when I meet Delevingne properly, I mention that I had been looking at her face in the newspaper only a few minutes before.
Her eyebrows - yes, those eyebrows - crinkle into a frown. "Why am I in the paper?" she inquires guilelessly.
The real question, of course, is when she is not in the paper. These days, it seems, the only things that appear more often than the 22-year-old Londoner's features are the crossword and the date.
But things appear to be changing. After her small role in last year's The Face of an Angel, and perhaps her gun-toting cameo in Taylor Swift's Bad Blood video, Delevingne is setting her sights on an acting career that could see her quitting the fashion catwalk, at least for a while.
In the pipeline are appearances in such upcoming blockbusters as Pan and Suicide Squad. First, though, comes an eye-catching turn in Paper Towns, the latest film version of a best-selling novel by US author John Green.
Green is best known for The Fault in Our Stars, a romantic novel about teenagers with cancer. The book spawned a hit film in 2014 that made more than $300m (Â£192m) at the box office.
The makers of Paper Towns would dearly love to emulate that success, whisking its stars around the world on an extensive international press tour in an attempt to get the word out.
Delevingne plays Margo Spiegelman, a flighty force of nature who vanishes one day from the Floridian suburbs after a wild night of payback in which she takes elaborate revenge on three high school peers she believes have wronged her.
Along for the ride is Quentin "Q" Jacobson, a socially inept neighbour who has carried a torch for Margo ever since she came to live next door to him when they were both young children.
Delevingne admits it "wasn't hard" to take on Margo as "we definitely have things in common". "It was nice picking things out of my own life and my own self to play the role," she explains.
She also owns up to having wanted to commit her own acts of revenge in the past - perhaps on those who have poured cold water on her acting aspirations, or who have dared to suggest she is ever so slightly overexposed?
"I wouldn't be human if I hadn't wanted to do that; I think everyone has wanted to," she mutters in a husky growl that barely registers when I listen back to our brief encounter later.
"But it never turns out well, I don't think; it's always a quick fix and it never really helps. I think revenge is just moving on and being happy - that's my revenge."
Margo's absence is keenly felt by Quentin, who makes it his mission to find out what happened to her and where she has gone.
In so doing, what begins as a tale of unrequited romance spins off into a mystery that, when Quentin sets off with friends to the "paper town" he believes Margo has fled to, morphs again into a light-hearted road movie.
"Paper Towns isn't just a comedy or a romance, a mystery or a drama - it contains all of those elements," agrees Green. "I think it's rare these days, at least with big studio movies, when they aren't just one genre."
Green, for his part, believes Delevingne is perfectly cast as his mercurial heroine. "Cara is just so spontaneous, alive and fascinating," he gushes. "You can't stop watching her.
"I don't know anyone who knows so well what it's like to have people project ideas onto two-dimensional images of you, and make broad conclusions about you based on very limited information."
"I'd work with her again in a heartbeat," says actor Nat Wolff, a supporting player in The Fault in Our Stars who steps up to play Paper Towns' male lead. "She's just a really natural, spontaneous actress and very similar to her character."
A "paper town", by the way, is a bogus hamlet placed on maps by cartographers to catch out plagiarists. Might the idea of going off the grid like Margo appeal to Delevingne herself? "Sure," she shrugs.
"I feel, though, that every time I start a new film it's like starting a new life. When I started out I would go off to countries where I was modelling and be a completely different person."
Interview over, Cara gleefully resumes what appears to be an ongoing game of catch that involves throwing a small box across the room to one of her attendants. It is the first time I have seen her smile since that little skit in the corridor.
I leave the hotel and take a short cut back to the office through the ground floor of a large department store. As I walk past the perfume counter, who should I see but Delevingne pouting back at me.
Paper Towns is out in the UK on 17 August.
