Princess Charlotte: Norfolk church creates knitted christening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Knitters have recreated Princess Charlotte's christening in wool as part of a church fundraising festival.

But organisers have admitted the scene is "not an exact recreation of the real baptism" - partly because they started planning it more than 18 months ago.
The replica royal event is at St Peter and St Paul's church in Griston in Norfolk - one of six churches taking part in a Blossom and Yarn Festival.
Over 11,000 squares were used to create themed scenes for the six churches.
The themes include Easter, Christmas, wedding, baptism, remembrance and harvest.
Artistic director Lois Gill said: "We were always going to portray baptism in one of the churches, but then the Duchess of Cambridge became pregnant and it all fitted into the timing that we could replicate Princess Charlotte's christening."
The colours chosen for the figures were dictated by the wool available, which was either donated or from charity shops.
"We chose green for the Duchess of Cambridge, the Queen is wearing peach and the Duke of Cambridge is in a dark jacket and grey trousers," she said.
Prince Harry - who was unable to attend the event at Church of St Mary Magdalene at the Queen's Sandringham estate last Sunday - is in attendance at the knitted replica in "a very jaunty lilac colour".
Most of the figures and many other items, including roses, small animals and cakes, were made from 10cm knitted squares.
A likeness of the Bishop of Norwich, the Right Reverend Graham Jones, was one of the 31 human figures created by more than 100 knitters.
The real bishop said: "My admiration is enormous - if my life depended on it, I couldn't knit a bishop."
