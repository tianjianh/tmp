[SN]TITLE[SN]
Eastleigh 0-1 Woking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Woking climbed out of the National League drop zone with victory at Eastleigh, despite playing with 10 men for most of the second half.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Spitfires made a strong start but were unable to make it count with Bondz N'Gala among those to see good chances saved by Michael Poke.
Gozie Ugwu punished the hosts for their early profligacy, nodding home Dennon Lewis' cross from close range in the 16th minute to notch his 12th goal of the season.
Garry Hill's side, who beat Torquay last time out, went down to 10 men when Lewis saw red for a second yellow in the 68th minute, but they came through a nervy finish unscathed as Eastleigh pushed for a late winner.
Woking are now up to 19th, two places and a point above the relegation zone.
