Matt Greenwood was given nine months to live after cancer in his hip spread to his lungs.
The principal of St Edmund Hall, in Oxford, where Matt was studying, said he was an "extremely brave man".
The engineering student from Walsall was described as "inspirational" and was commended for his sense of humour.
Last month, Matt's friends launched a campaign to help him complete his bucket list.
Prior to his death, Matt thanked people for their support, saying it had been "unbelievable from all directions, just an outpouring of love and it's really, really been moving."
