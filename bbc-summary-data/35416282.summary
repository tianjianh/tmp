The SeaGen turbine was lowered into place in 2008 and generates electricity from from tidal currents.
Two horizontal axis turbines are anchored to the seabed and are driven by the powerful currents resulting from the tide moving in and out.
Its owners Atlantis Resources said it will be decommissioned later this year.
The company said it had been "an essential research and design platform".
Stephen Ward, the firm's director of power generation, said: "This year, we will embark on the next stage of the R&D (research and development) process and focus on decommissioning the SeaGen device.
"This operation will be the first commercial scale turbine development to be decommissioned and will help us to understand the complete life-cycle of a tidal stream development."
