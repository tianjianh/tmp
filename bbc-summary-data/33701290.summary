PSNI overtime spending falls by a fifth, figures show

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Overtime spending by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) decreased last year by almost 20%.

The overtime bill for PSNI officers and staff was down by £11.5m, from £59.2m in 2013/14 to £47.7m in 2014/15.
In England and Wales it totalled almost £1bn over three years and went up by £6m last year, a freedom of information request by BBC Radio 5 live found.
One individual within the PSNI was paid almost £44,000 in overtime in 2014/15.
Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd said the PSNI is facing "unprecedented budgetary pressures".
He said the service was having to find ways to "live within our reduced means".
But he denied that budget cuts were having a negative impact on frontline policing.
"We have been looking very carefully at every aspect of our service delivery to identify and implement ways of providing those services within our reducing budget," he said.
"This has not meant a reduction in frontline policing services, rather it is simply a change to what that service looks like.
"We have made significant efforts, based on research and examination of demand, to ensure that we have the right people in the right place at the right time to effectively deliver our services."
A recent shake-up of the PSNI's policing districts, local policing teams and support services was part of the process, he said.
In 2011, the PSNI said a 13% rise in overtime spending was due to the terrorist threat.
But the decrease in 2014/15 is not a suggestion that the threat has reduced, it said.
"The threat posed by violent, terrorist criminals remains severe," ACC Todd said.
"While this threat persists, keeping people safe, is and always will be of paramount importance to the Police Service of Northern Ireland.
"This task continues to require significant policing resources."
He added that the PSNI would be keeping its resources "under regular review" as it faces "significant challenges".
Figures for 39 forces in England and Wales show the overtime bill rose from £307.1m in 2013/14 to £313.2m in 2014/15.
Police Scotland spent £18.2m on overtime in 2014/15, a reduction of £6m on the previous year.
