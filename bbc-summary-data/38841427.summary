The crash, on the A325 near Farnham on Wednesday evening, involved a motorcycle, a female pedestrian and a car which failed to stop at the scene.
The 43-year-old woman, from Surrey, suffered serious injuries and died on the way to hospital.
Police are appealing for help in tracing a dark-coloured people carrier-style car which may have front-end damage.
The crash happened near the junction of Binstead Road in Alice Holt Forest at about 17:25 GMT.
The motorcyclist suffered minor injuries.
The road was closed for several hours while investigators inspected the scene.
Sgt Rik Grant, of Hampshire Constabulary's Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: "We are following several lines of inquiries to find this vehicle and we would urge anyone who has information about the car or who was driving it to come forward."
