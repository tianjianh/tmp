The firm will be an official partner of the games, the second level of domestic sponsorship support.
The 2020 organising committee says the firm will provide lifts, escalators and moving walkways at sporting venues.
The move gives Mitsubishi Electric the right to use Olympic logos, mascots and slogans in its marketing campaigns.
The move brings the total number of Tokyo 2020 Partners to 28, including 13 in the official partners criteria.
The Olympic sponsor programme is divided into four separate categories, with the IOC's Olympic Partner (TOP) programme constituting the very highest level of Olympic sponsorship.
The three remaining categories are designated for domestic sponsors. The highest domestic tier comprises gold partners, the second tier consists of official partners and the third tier is made up of official supporters.
