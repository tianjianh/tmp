Kasabian Newton-Smith, eight, from Sheffield, was diagnosed with cancer as a toddler and has two brain tumours.
Football teams, players and individuals have been asked to tweet with #1LastSmile4Kasabian.
In a video message, the England captain said he and his team-mates were very proud of the bravery shown by Kasabian.
Manchester United forward Rooney said: "I just want to say a massive thank you for your support and I've kept my shirt from [Friday] night's game against Scotland - so will send it down to you.
"I hope you enjoy it, and hopefully it makes you smile."
Kasabian has seen one Manchester United game at Old Trafford and "absolutely loved it", his family said.
The campaign, organised by Grassroots Football, appealed to the entire footballing world to join together and send "Kasabian 1 last smile".
People are being encouraged to wear a football strip, hold one finger in the air and smile for a photograph.
Billy Sharp, who plays for Sheffield United, tweeted a picture using #1LastSmile4Kasabian featuring Rooney and Adam Lallana, who scored for England in the win over Scotland.
Alan Shearer also took to Twitter to post a message of support.
Kasabian had "desperately" wanted to follow in his big brother's footsteps and play football and he had three games for Southey Wolves under-10s, his father Simon Newton-Smith said.
Watching him play football "was a dream", he said.
Kasabian has been diagnosed with Ewing sarcoma and has had 111 radiation treatments.
His brain tumours are inoperable, but he has been treated for five other tumours in six years.
He is now confined to bed at home and his family celebrated his ninth birthday, which is in December, early.
Kasabian, who has six brothers and sisters, has previously taken part in fundraising efforts for Sheffield Children's Hospital and cancer charities.
