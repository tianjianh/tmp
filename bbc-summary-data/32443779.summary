West Indies v England: Marlon Samuels backed by Ambrose

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marlon Samuels should keep having fun at England's expense, says West Indies bowling coach Sir Curtly Ambrose.

Samuels continued his ongoing battle with Ben Stokes by saluting the England all-rounder after he was dismissed for eight on day three of the second Test.
As Stokes walked off he passed Samuels, who clutched his hat to his chest and raised his right hand to his temple.
"There's nothing wrong with a little bantering," said Ambrose. "This is international cricket."
Samuels said attempts by Stokes to goad him acted as motivation as he scored 103 in his side's innings of 299 on Wednesday.
And former England captain Michael Vaughan, commentating for BBC's Test Match Special, praised Samuels for his response.
"I think that's the greatest thing I've seen in Test cricket for a long time," said Vaughan.
"I hope he doesn't get any kind of fine. I thought that was brilliant banter."
Ambrose, who took 405 Test wickets in 98 appearances for West Indies, added a word of caution.
"As long as it doesn't go over the top, I'm fine with it," he said.
"I think it's more friendly than anything else. He gave a salute. Is that a sign of respect? I don't know but I'm hoping so.
"We always make sure that we tell the guys to keep it clean, keep it within a certain range and don't go over the top."
Joe Root dominated the third day's play, hitting an unbeaten 118 to put England firmly in control.
The tourists finished on 373-6, 74 runs ahead of the home side's first-innings total.
Samuels took the wicket of Gary Ballance, bowling the number three after he had made 77.
