[SN]TITLE[SN]
South Bristol Link Road opens to users

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major new Â£45m link road for the south of Bristol is now open to traffic

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South Bristol Link Road joins the A370 to the A38 and forms part of the route for the city's Metrobus scheme.
Supporters said it will bring major economic development to the south of the city.
But critics said it will worsen pollution and fail to reduce traffic levels. The scheme ends as works start on Hartcliffe Way, which will be one way from Monday night until November.
The four councils behind the wider transport strategy said the new road, which is 3.1 miles long (about 5km), will help boost south Bristol's economy, a view shared by the local Chamber of Commerce and firms in the area.
The development, which runs from Hengrove to the Long Ashton bypass with links to the A38 for Bristol Airport and the A370 to Weston-super-Mare, promises to reduce traffic on unsuitable residential roads by providing motorists with an alternative route.
Phil Pope runs a sign making firm in south Bristol and said the new road will be worth the wait.
He said: "One of the concerns for us was that we were being gradually cut off in the south of Bristol, access routes weren't good and it was too difficult to get here.
"This road is going to open up things for us, for the area generally, the new hospital and the estates that are up the road."
Green Party prospective candidate for the Bristol South constituency Tony Dyer said previously: "Part of it goes through green belt and we're not convinced it's going to make a major difference to traffic.
"It will work for a small section of it but our other concern is how it's going to drive more demand for yet more roads."
