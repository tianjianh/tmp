Euro 2016: What are Wales' top five sporting moments before this?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales lost to Portugal in the semi-final of Euro 2016 - ending a glorious adventure in France.

The 3-1 quarter final win against Belgium was watched by 1.27m television viewers in Wales - a record for a sports match.
Throw-in huge crowds at fan parks the length and breadth of Wales and last night's game promises to eclipse that figure.
But what are Wales' greatest sporting moments? Here are five to remember - in chronological order:
The statue of Fred Keenor outside Cardiff City Stadium honours the captain of the only non-English side to have won the FA Cup.
Former Prime Minister Lloyd George was among the thousands of Welshmen and women at Wembley in April 1927 that witnessed Cardiff's 1-0 win against Arsenal.
A Scotsman, Hughie Ferguson, who scored the only goal although it can be argued a Welshman inadvertently had the final touch.
Arsenal's Maerdy-born goalkeeper Dan Lewis appeared to collect the ball, but clumsily allowed it to roll through his grasp.
Lewis blamed his brand new jersey for the error, but the irony would not be lost on the fact that the Cup would be leaving England for the first and, so far, only time in its history.
Over 150,000 fans lined the streets of Cardiff to welcome the team on their return home to the Welsh capital.
Cardiff City would reach the FA Cup final once again in 2008, but lost 1-0 to Portsmouth at the new Wembley.

The Welsh rugby team have been European champions 26 times since the start of what we now call the Six Nations Championship.
So why pick the class of '71 and not the Grand Slammers of '76, '78 or the unexpected and glorious team that defied the odds to claim the 2005 Slam under Mike Ruddock.
Well, in '71 they clinched the title 9-5 in France against a powerful French side thanks to JPR Williams' interception and Gareth Edwards' spectacular finish.
But more than that, the bulk of captain John Dawes' team went to New Zealand the following summer and played a key role in the British and Irish Lions' 2-1 Test series win over the All Blacks.
It remains the Lions' only series win in New Zealand and JPR, Gareth, Barry John, Dawes, Merv "the swerve" Davies and Gerald Davies remain household names in Wales - and elsewhere - to this day.
Wales 1971 - a truly great vintage.
Ian Woosnam was rated the world's number one golfer for 50 weeks between April 1991 and March 1992 and remains the only Welshman to win one of golf's four Majors.
His four days of glory came down to the final putt on the final green at the Augusta National, as all good golfing stories should.
Woosnam was -11 - one shot ahead of Jose Maria Olazabal and two clear of Tom Watson, who were both in the clubhouse.
The red-check-trousered Welshman had a seven-footer for par, and his air-punching celebration as the ball tipped into the hole remains a definitive moment in the pantheon of great Welsh sporting moments.
The nation punched the air with him. He would later captain the European Ryder Cup team to a record win over USA in 2006 - but as a player, 1991 topped the lot.

Team GB won 19 gold medals in China - their best return in 100 years.
And it was Wales' Nicole Cooke who set the ball rolling on the soaking-wet streets of Beijing when she timed her finish to perfection to claim the road race title.
She was the first Welsh athlete to win Olympic gold in 32 years and did so in style, beating a field including legendary Netherlands rider Marianne Vos.
Cooke had struck gold for Wales in the 2002 Commonwealth Games when she was 19-years-old, but this crowned the many other achievements of one of Wales' great athletes.
She was also the first rider - male or female - to win the Olympic and World titles in the same year.
Joe Calzaghe's legacy as Wales' greatest boxer is secure after a career where he went 46 fights unbeaten and was recognised as a two-weight world champion.
After his stunning victory over Jeff Lacy catapulted Calzaghe onto the world scene, he finally got his wish of a career-defining fight when WBC world super middleweight champion Mikkel Kessler agreed to meet Calzaghe at what was then the Millennium Stadium for a unification battle.
Calzaghe had held the WBO world title for 10-years by the time he faced Kessler and over 50,000 fans were in attendance for the biggest British boxing bill in a generation.
The atmosphere was electric and the fight matched the hype, Calzaghe won the hardest contest of his career - or certainly since becoming a world champion at Chris Eubank's expense - on points after both men produced superb displays.
Kessler would recover and win back a world over Britain's Carl Froch three years later, emphasising that Calzaghe beat the Dane at the peak of his powers.
His destruction of Lacy might have been his most dazzling display and his victory in the US over Bernard Hopkins was more lucrative, but Calzaghe's triumph over Kessler stands alone as the pinnacle for one of Wales' all-time sporting icons.
