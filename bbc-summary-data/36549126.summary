Roald Dahl Llandaff birthplace for sale for £1.3m

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Cardiff birthplace of children's author Roald Dahl is on the market - for £1.3m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The five-bedroomed house, Ty Gwyn, was designed to an exact specifications of Dahl's father Harold Dahl in 1907.
The family moved to Radyr in 1918, but Dahl spent the first two years of his life in the Llandaff home.
September 13 marks the 100th anniversary of Roald Dahl's birth, and Cardiff is gearing up for weeks of events and exhibitions.
Current owner Gerry Johns, who has lived in the house for 35 years, said there were plans to install a blue plaque on the house as part of the commemorations.
He added: "It's been a fantastic house to live in. We had his niece visit once with a film crew, and I did meet Mr Dahl a few times."
