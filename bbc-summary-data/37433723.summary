Clarke, 34, joined AFC Wimbledon on a free transfer in June after he was released by the Cobblers.
But he becomes manager Ronnie Moore's first signing for the club since he took charge at the end of August.
"It just didn't work out at Wimbledon, but fortunately it's come around that I'm here and I'm excited to get going," Clarke told BBC Radio Solent.
