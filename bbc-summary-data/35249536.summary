Australia v West Indies: David Warner hits century in draw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Opener David Warner hit an unbeaten 122 as Australia drew a rain-affected third and final Test against West Indies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A draw was inevitable after only 86.2 overs were possible on the first four days after heavy rain in Sydney.
The West Indies, who resumed on 248-7, were 330 all out before Warner hit an 82-ball century, the quickest ever at Sydney, as Australia reached 176-2.
Australia were already 2-0 up in the series, but the draw stops them from moving top of the Test rankings.
The opening two hours of the final day were also lost to rain but Denesh Ramdin was able to complete his second half century of the match before he was caught by Steve Smith off Steve O'Keefe.
Fellow off-spinner Nathan Lyon had Kemar Roach (15) caught at short leg by Joe Burns to leave the tourists 300-9.
Lyon than snaffled a catch at point as O'Keefe removed Jerome Taylor for 13 to finish with a Test best 3-63.
In reply, Warner brought up his half century in just 42 balls with a six off Jomel Warrican but the West Indies spinner did remove Burns, who lofted a catch to Roach at mid-on to depart for 26.
Mitchell Marsh (21) top-edged a sweep to Jermaine Blackwood at slip to gift Warrican (2-62) a second wicket.
By then Warner had completed his 16th Test century but both sides elected to end the game as a draw midway through the final session.
