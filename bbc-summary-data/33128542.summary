A holidaymaker had to be rescued from the sea two days running after drifting away on an airbed off the Kent coast.

Folkestone Rescue said a crew went to help him "some distance" off Folkestone Warren on Saturday afternoon.
Rescuers then realised it was the same person who had been blown on to rocks on an airbed the day before.
Earlier reports said the man was thought to be an illegal immigrant but the Home Office has said he was an Albanian national on holiday in the UK.
Folkestone Rescue said it was called out to help by Dover Coastguard at about 15:00 BST.
The stricken man, who had been taken out to sea by the tide and was having difficulty paddling back to shore, was again given safety advice before being escorted to Sunny Sands.
Folkestone Rescue said he was then handed over to Kent Police, given "further advice" and released.
