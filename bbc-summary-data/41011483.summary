The elderly residents were initially cared for in hotels after the blaze broke out at Forth Bay Nursing Home in Kincardine on Monday afternoon.
The majority of residents and staff are now being accommodated by the council at Napier House in Glenrothes.
Fife Council said five people were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
About 60 firefighters used water jets to tackle the fire at the home in Walker Street, which broke out at about 15:20.
Members of the public came to the aid of the residents by helping them to find shelter.
Police Scotland said all residents and staff had been accounted for.
Part of the nursing home roof has been destroyed in the blaze.
Forth Bay is home to up to 53 residents, some of whom have dementia or complex health conditions.
Caring Homes, who run the nursing home, said all the residents were evacuated safely.
Michael Kellet, director of the Fife Health and Social Care Partnership, thanked all those involved in the recovery operation after the fire, including volunteers from Kincardine Community Association.
"Staff from services across the council worked until late in the evening to make sure everyone was taken care of properly and I'd like to thank them all for the dedication they have shown.
"Due to everyone's swift thinking, actions and planning we very quickly had arrangements in place to manage this challenging situation."
Mr Kellet added that planning was now under way to find longer-term accommodation for the residents.
