Chances were few and far between until the Gulls' Brett Williams bent a magnificent shot past Magnus Norman from outside the area after 25 minutes.
The Sandgrounders however were more than a match for the hosts, and Andrai Jones forced Brendan Moore into a save with a smart volley.
The visitors proved their mettle in the second half when Callum Howe ventured forward and lobbed Moore with a cool finish, out-of-keeping with his defensive instincts.
Southport boss Steve Burr played a late masterstroke by throwing on James Caton, and the creative midfielder found space to slot home the winner with 15 minutes remaining.
