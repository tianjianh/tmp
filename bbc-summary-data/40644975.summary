The 27-year-old, who spent the past two years on loan at Roma, signed a four-year deal with the Italian champions.
The Poland international played 38 times for Roma last season and kept 14 clean sheets - the most in Serie A.
"When you come to Juve, it's because you've been chosen. I had no hesitation," said Szczesny, who made 132 appearances for Arsenal in eight years at the club.
"I'm ready for a new challenge - Juventus is the best choice for the next stage of my career."
Szczesny said he had already spoken to Juve number one Gianluigi Buffon, who he described as "a legend in our game".
"I'm really happy to be here," he added. "I'm not feeling any pressure. I'm here to represent the club at the highest level."
