Cycling stars - including eight medallists from the Rio Olympics - are racing from Glasgow to Castle Douglas as the Tour of Britain begins.

The opening stage of the week-long event is the only one in Scotland.
The Grand Depart saw riders rolling out of Glasgow's George Square before doing a circuit of the city.
They headed south, and have taken in Kilmarnock, Auchinleck, Cumnock and Dalmellington. They are due to finish in Castle Douglas at 15:30.
Spectators lined the route with the race also being televised.
The Tour of Britain has grown in stature in recent years and now attracts some of the biggest names in the sport.
Olympic medallists Mark Cavendish, Sir Bradley Wiggins, Owain Doull, Elia Viviani, Jack Bobridge, Alex Edmondson, Michael Hepburn and Tom Dumoulin are all among the line-up.
Former world hour record holder Rohan Dennis and German sprinter Andre Greipel, nicknamed The Gorilla, are other high profile riders taking part.
Sports bodies hope that staging major events can also help to create the stars of the future or simply encourage people to get more exercise.
Hours after the Tour of Britain started in Glasgow, the Sky Ride cycling event kicked off in the city.  Thousands of cyclists of all ages took part in the event, which was started by Sir Chris Hoy.
Vicky Strange, head of development at Cycling Scotland, said: "To have such a big event now coming to Scotland for its first stage is just fantastic.
"The Tour of Britain is one of the biggest events on the calendar - it has really gained in profile.
"So to have the big names coming to Scotland and having these people - household names - right there on your doorstep and we can all get the chance to go and see them up close, I think is hugely inspirational for us."
Past winners of the Tour of Britain's previous visits to Scotland are:
Large crowds gathered at the start and finish of the race will provide a boost for businesses in the area.
Dumfries and Galloway Council, which has hosted the event on a number of occasions, estimates the visitor expenditure at between Â£250,000 and Â£300,000.
There is also a further boost for accommodation providers with the huge entourage which follows a major cycling race.
Television coverage of the race, which is beamed around the world, is seen as providing a major opportunity to raise the tourist profile of an area.
It has previously been estimated to translate to the equivalent of an advertising campaign costing hundreds of thousands of pounds.
Councils which have helped to host the event will hope it shows off the attractions of the west and south of Scotland to its very best.
Across the opening stage there was a breakaway attempt, and a bunch sprint finish on King Street looks a likely outcome.
If that is the case, there are few sporting scenes more dramatic than a huge group of cyclists hurtling at top speed in their multi-coloured kits.
Rival teams will battle in the final kilometres to try to get their lead-out "train" in position to give their best sprinter a chance of victory.
Spectacular crashes are commonplace but, if he emerges unscathed, Mark Cavendish has to be among the favourites to take the win.
