[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stephen Ward denies manslaughter of baby son

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father killed his nine-month-old son by violently shaking him and causing "catastrophic injuries", a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Ward died after his father, Stephen, called an ambulance because his son had stopped breathing at his home in Cirencester, Gloucestershire.
Bristol Crown Court heard that medical tests concluded that Jordan's injuries were not the result of an accident.
Mr Ward denies the manslaughter of his son in 2014.
The jury heard that Mr Ward, who now lives in Nailsworth, had a history of losing his temper when Jordan cried.
The baby's mother, Paula Watts, told the court that she had concerns that Mr Ward had been hurting their son after she once heard him slap Jordan when he was crying.
Mr Ward told her he had just "tapped" Jordan.
Ms Watts said she confronted him about Jordan's injuries after the baby had been admitted to hospital.
She said "I asked him to look me in the eyes and swear on my life that he hadn't done anything. He said he hadn't."
The trial continues.
