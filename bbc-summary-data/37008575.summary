Prince's estate denies planning to sell his Paisley Park home

The administrator of Prince's estate has denied reports it is planning to sell Paisley Park, the star's former home and recording studio complex.

A court filing on Friday had included the property among a list of assets that could be sold.
But the Bremer Trust issued a statement on Saturday saying it "has no plans" to offload Paisley Park.
It added that the "Purple Rain house" - which featured in the career-making film of the same name - was also safe.
Prince was found dead in an elevator inside Paisley Park in April, after an accidental overdose of painkillers.
Thousands of fans gathered outside the property in the following days to lay tributes and pay their respects.
There have been calls for the studios and soundstages to be opened to the public, in the style of Elvis's former home, Graceland.
Prince himself "was working on it being a museum," his friend and collaborator Sheila E told Entertainment Tonight earlier this year.
"He's been gathering memorabilia and stuff from all the tours, like my drums and his motorcycle," she said.
Last Friday, the Bremer Trust applied for permission to sell more than 20 properties owned by the late star, worth an estimated $28 million (Â£21.5 million).
It is not known why Paisley Park was among them - but the revenue would undoubtedly help to pay a tax bill that is thought to amount to more than $100 million (Â£77 million), due in January next year.
Meanwhile, the process of determining Prince's heirs is continuing in court.
Last month, a judge narrowed down a pool of more than 40 claimants, excluding 29 of them and ordering genetic testing on a further six, including four siblings or half-siblings - Tyka Nelson, Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson and John Nelson - and a possible niece and grand-niece, Brianna Nelson and Victoria Nelson.
The process has become necessary as Prince died without leaving a will and had no known offspring.
Separately, his former wife Manuela Testolini has appeared in court to argue that records from the couple's 2006 divorce should remain sealed.
A local newspaper wants the papers to be released, but Testolini's attorneys have objected, saying the records are tied to a private settlement, and the release of financial records could make her "a target".
