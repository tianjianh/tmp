Everton defender John Stones has been linked with moves, while Leicester striker Jamie Vardy is reported to have a Â£25m release clause in his contract.
"This group of players know and have accepted very well that when you are on England duty, you are on England duty," Hodgson said.
The manager must name his final 23-man squad for the finals by Tuesday.
He called up 26 players for their penultimate warm-up match, in which they beat Australia 2-1 at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Friday.
England will play their final pre-tournament friendly on Thursday, against Portugal at Wembley.
Hodgson added: "We are not trying to block players' futures or transfers, but as far as we are concerned, our ongoing theme is 'England's England, your club's your club'.
"When you're with England, we want you to stay focused on us."
