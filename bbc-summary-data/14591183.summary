[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Highways Agency is warning motorists about M1 slip road closures in Bedfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The motorway's southbound entry slip road and northbound exit slip road at Junction 12 will be closed from 06:00 BST on Saturday until 05:00 BST on Monday.
The closures are required to allow work to replace a gas main to take place.
Project manager Lynne Stinson said drivers should allow extra time for their journeys.
"We have worked with National Grid to minimise the impact and duration of the closures on road users and the local community.
"We do not expect a significant impact on traffic, however we would advise road users to plan their journeys, allow extra time and follow the clearly signed diversion routes," said Ms Stinson.
During the closures, northbound traffic will be directed along the M1 northbound to Junction 13, and back on the southbound carriageway to exit the M1 on the Junction 12 southbound exit slip-road.
Southbound road users wishing to join the M1 at Junction 12 will be signposted northbound to Junction 13, and back on to the M1 southbound.
A further closure will take place from 06:00 BST on Saturday 3 September to 05:00 BST on Monday 5 September.
The August Bank Holiday weekend will not be affected.
