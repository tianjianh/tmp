[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Figures from Cancer Research UK found obese women in the UK have 40% greater risk of being diagnosed with a weight-related cancer.
The charity has said more than a fifth of women are obese in Northern Ireland,
Cancer Research UK said obesity increases a woman's risk of at least seven types of cancer, including bowel and post-menopausal breast.
Dr Julie Sharp, head of health information at Cancer Research UK, said helping people understand how they can reduce their risk of developing cancer "remains crucial in tackling the disease".
"Lifestyle changes like not smoking, keeping a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet and cutting back on alcohol are the big opportunities for us all to personally reduce our cancer risk," she said.
"Making these changes is not a guarantee against cancer, but it stacks the odds in our favour."
