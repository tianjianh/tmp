Great Britain's Kyle Edmund and James Ward remain in contention for the second singles place at the Davis Cup final against Belgium.

Edmund practised with Dan Evans in Ghent on Wednesday, before Ward had a lengthy hit with Andy Murray.
British number two Edmund, ranked 100, would make his Davis Cup debut in the final.
"If I get into that situation, it's something I'm going to have to deal with," Edmund told BBC Sport.
Great Britain are in the final for the first time since 1978 and hope to win their first Davis Cup since 1936, while Belgium have yet to win the team competition.
Edmund, 20, could be the first player since Spain's Feliciano Lopez in 2003 to make his Davis Cup debut in the final, and the first man ever to win a live singles rubber on a final debut.
"At the end of the day, it still is a tennis match," he said.
"Even with experience or no experience, whoever plays is going to be nervous because it's a Davis Cup final. I think that's normal. I'll just deal with it, if I play."
Ward, 28, won a dramatic five-set match against John Isner to help Britain past the United States in the first round, but was left out of the team for the semi-final win over Australia.
The Londoner, ranked 156, has won 11 singles matches since making his Davis Cup debut in 2010.
"It's not easy," he said. "Everyone wants to play in such a big competition, and obviously the final.
"But, you know, it's been a big team effort for years. It's not just about this year, it's been about the last four, five years. Many different players, even guys that aren't here this week, have played a big part in that."
Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot complete the five-man squad, with the Murray brothers expected to pair up for the doubles on Saturday after winning tight matches against France and Australia.
Captain Leon Smith has until one hour before the draw, at 13:00 GMT on Thursday, to select his final four and decide on the line-up for Friday's opening two singles matches.
The Flanders Expo will host 13,000 spectators on each of the three days of the final, and the venue has been notable for the low roof and temperature early in the week.
"The roof is low but it's approved," Belgium captain Johan van Herck said. "It's not that high and I think Andy will find a way to make the lobs - he's a good player.
"I think it will be noisy, with all the people in here it will be hot, and I think it will be worthy of a Davis Cup final."
Around 5,000 British fans are expected in Ghent over the three days, and security has been heightened following the high state of alert in the capital Brussels, 35 miles away.
"It's safe to be here but it's an awkward situation," Van Herck added. "We have to live with it. We have all the confidence in the organisation that it will be a safe event."
