Britain's Andy Murray will head into Wimbledon in confident mood after claiming three titles in two months.

The 2013 champion plays world number 58 Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan in round one on Tuesday.
And the Scot has been boosted by his first titles on clay in Munich and Madrid, followed by his fourth on the grass of Queen's Club.
"I think in any sport, winning gives you confidence," said the 28-year-old, seeded third.
"This year I've won a lot of matches, more than I ever have in my career to this point in a season."

Murray fell at the quarter-final stage against Grigor Dimitrov when defending his Wimbledon title last year but is widely tipped to challenge again with 41 match wins already in 2015.
"I'm certainly not getting carried away," he added. "I know how difficult these events are to win.
"I just concentrate on the first match and try my best to get through that one.
"I enjoy playing in the high pressure situations. You know, that's really what I play for now. I enjoy these events. I prepare extremely hard for them.
"I feel like I'm coming into the event as best prepared as I can be."
Two-time champion Rafael Nadal is a potential quarter-final opponent for Murray and the Spaniard feels better placed to challenge than in recent years.
Nadal, 29, has lost in the fourth, first and second round over the last three years, but showed he is in good form this year with victory on grass in Stuttgart two weeks ago.
"I feel good," he said. "Winning a tournament on grass after five years is a good moment for me and a special one.
"I am practising well this week. Let's see if I am able to compete well. I'm just happy to be here healthy, that's the most important thing.
"Last year I was better, in 2012 and 2013 I couldn't play well here. I had too many problems with the knees."
Seven-time champion and second seed Roger Federer is in the same half of the draw, and says he is benefiting from the introduction of an extra week of grass-court tennis between the French Open and Wimbledon.
"It's probably been the best preparation I've ever had for Wimbledon, for obvious reasons, because we have a week more on the grass," said the 33-year-old Swiss, who won the Halle Open in Germany for an eighth time last week.
"I'm sure I'm not the only one saying that this year. I'm sure everybody will say the same.
"Winning Halle has given me the extra confidence I guess it's going to take me to win this title here."
