Janice Atkinson: Expelled MEP appeals UKIP decision

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MEP Janice Atkinson has lodged an appeal against the decision to expel her from UKIP for "bringing the party into disrepute".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She was thrown out in March after allegations a member of her staff tried to arrange a false receipt for a meal.
The South East MEP was also replaced as the general election candidate for Folkestone and Hythe after the claims were published in The Sun newspaper.
A spokesman for Ms Atkinson confirmed she lodged an appeal over the weekend.
Ms Atkinson and her assistant, Christine Hewitt, who was also expelled from the party following a disciplinary hearing, were given 14 days to appeal.
In March, The Sun published a secret recording appearing to show Ms Hewitt asking the manager of a restaurant in Margate, Kent, for an invoice for a much higher sum than the bill she had received.
The BBC has not been able to contact Ms Hewitt for a comment.
