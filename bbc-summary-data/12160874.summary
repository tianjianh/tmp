[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Italian man has astonished doctors by sneezing a bullet out through his nose after being shot in the head.

Darco Sangermano, 28, had been taken to hospital in Naples for emergency treatment after being hit by a stray bullet during New Year's Eve celebrations.
The bullet passed behind his right eye and lodged in his nostril, but miraculously did no serious damage.
He is expected to make a full recovery, doctors say.
Mr Sangermano had spent New Year's Eve with his girlfriend in Naples.
As the city sky exploded in a traditional celebration of fireworks, firecrackers - and the occasional high-spirited blast of firearms - he was wandering the streets when a stray .22 calibre bullet struck him on the side of the head, behind his right eye.
Bleeding heavily, he was rushed to hospital.
But while he was waiting for doctors he sneezed - and the bullet popped out of his right nostril.
Doctors say it had been slowed down when it hit his skull - which almost certainly saved his sight, as well as his life.
Mr Sangermano is expected to undergo laser surgery on his right eye's damaged retina.
