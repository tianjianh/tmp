A broken down train that blocked the Belfast to Londonderry railway line for about two hours has caused major disruption to several rail services.

The 17:10 BST train from Belfast to Derry broke down at Fortwilliam on Friday evening, blocking both the Derry and Larne lines northbound.
Engineers tried to fix the mechanical failure on site before the train was brought back to Yorkgate and passengers were transferred to another train.
It has caused delays and cancellations.
The 20:15 Whitehead to Belfast train service and the 20:25 Larne Harbour to Belfast train services have both been cancelled.
A woman travelling on the Belfast to Derry service told the BBC there was "standing room only" as passengers were stuck on the train for two hours.
Lynne Cooper complained that there was "no level of customer care" for those on board.
"If we were cattle, we would be given some refreshments and water.  You wouldn't transport cattle like that. It's totally unacceptable," she said.
A Translink spokeswoman said bus substitutions have been organised for Larne line passengers.
Northern Ireland Railway's (NIR) website said all northbound lines have now reopened but it warned that disruption is expected.
"Normal services will be provided as soon as possible," NIR said.
