Carlo Costly latched onto a long ball and lashed in a low 20-yard shot to put Honduras ahead on 31 minutes.
"Ecuador just had a bit more quality than Honduras. They can be proud of their performances. They were unlucky to lose against Switzerland and were very good against Honduras. I hope they give it a real go against France."
Ecuador equalised soon after when a deflected cross fell for Valencia to slot home. He then nodded in at the far post to give his side the lead.
Honduras pressed for an equaliser but a goal eluded them and they have now lost both group games.
Ecuador meet France in their final group game, knowing they need to match Switzerland's result against Honduras to reach the last 16.
Knowing defeat against Honduras would knock them out, Ecuador should have taken an early lead against Honduras.
A long ball from centre-back Jorge Guagua released Valencia, but he side-footed over the crossbar.
As a child, 24-year-old Enner Valencia milked cows and then sold the milk in his rural village in order to pay for his first pair of football boots.
Honduras defender Victor Bernardez then headed wide when unmarked before his long clearance set Costly free to net emphatically.
The goal was the country's first at a World Cup since 1982, but the lead did not last long, Valencia slotting from close range after a Juan Paredes shot was deflected into his path.
Honduras thought they had restored their lead when Jerry Bengtson bundled home after a Costly header came off the post, but the referee disallowed the goal for handball.
Valencia then nodded in at the far post following a Walter Ayovi free-kick to settle the game with his seventh goal in six internationals.
Honduras manager Luis Suarez:
"It was a very hard-fought match. We had a bit of difficulty keeping our nerves in check given what was at stake in the game, but I'm satisfied.
"We know it'll be tough to reach the next round, but it'd be even worse to have been knocked out already.
"We need to find a way to improve in order to win and while there's hope, we won't give up without a fight."
Ecuador manager Reinaldo Rueda:
"Even though we went behind, we got our goals at decisive moments.
"We know that reaching the next round isn't entirely in our own hands but we need to focus on our own game.
"We'll have to play as well, or even better than we did today, to beat France, because they're a side that have grown a lot."
