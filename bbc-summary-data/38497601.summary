Afcon 2017: Zimbabwe in chaos ahead of tournament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zimbabwe's preparations ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon have been thrown into chaos by a row over accommodation and financial issues.

BBC Sport has learned the team refused to stay at the Zifa Village training facility, saying it is sub-standard, and have been booked at a Harare hotel by Footballers Union of Zimbabwe.
The team were also unable to use the national sports stadium for training because a $60 fee had not been paid.
They had to use a high school instead.
It is unclear why the fee was not paid, given a mobile network provider announced a $250,000 sponsorship for the Warriors two weeks ago to cover all of the team's needs for their Nations Cup campaign.
Zimbabwe's first match of the 14 January to 5 February tournament is against Algeria on 15 January. They will also face Tunisia and Senegal in Group B.
