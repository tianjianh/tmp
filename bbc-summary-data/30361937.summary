Russell Hobbs has recalled 15 different models of irons after customers raised safety concerns about the products.

The electrical manufacturer told people to stop using the irons because there was a risk that the flex could fail, and offered a replacement or refund.
The company said consumer safety was its primary concern and apologised for any inconvenience caused.
Several customers posted on the firm's Facebook page that their iron caught fire while they were using it.
Rebecca Scurr wrote: "Just want to warn people of potential danger. My husband was ironing today when it caught fire and burnt him. Lucky he quickly threw it to the floor (damaging our kitchen floor). Could have been a lot worse."
Another customer, Clare Joanna, said: "Today when using the Russell Hobbs Steam Glide iron it suddenly sparked and has burnt my hand badly. The electrical burn is incredibly painful and I would not want anyone else to go through this."
Jonathan Wells told the BBC's Watchdog programme that his iron failed in June this year.
He said: "I realised from the pain in my hand that came straight after it that the iron had caught fire somehow and burned my hand.
"The pain was getting so bad I had to go into the kitchen and run it under the cold tap for probably about an hour."
A Russell Hobbs spokesman said: "The company's primary concern is, as ever, for the safety of their consumers.
"Russell Hobbs has always taken their responsibilities as a manufacturer extremely seriously. The decision to recall these products has been taken with the utmost consideration for the public."
The model numbers, found on a rectangular label on the underside of the heel of the iron, are: 18651, 18742, 19220, 19221, 18743, 19840, 18720, 15081, 19222, 19400, 20260, 18741, 20280, 20550-10, 20560-10.
The affected irons will also have batch codes starting with 045 through to 365 and ending with 12, or starting with 001 through to 195 and ending with 13.
The company said irons with any other number sequence were not affected.
Russell Hobbs said in a statement on its website: "As part of our ongoing quality monitoring program, we've identified an issue with a small number of our irons, that may carry a risk that the flex may fail.
"If you do have an affected iron, please stop using it immediately. Please telephone our customer service department who will advise you of how to return your iron for a replacement or full refund of the purchase price.
"We would like to thank you for your co-operation and apologise for any inconvenience. No other Russell Hobbs products or irons outside of the above codes are affected by this recall."
