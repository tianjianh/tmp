[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prominent member of a Rochdale mosque who died after being found injured in a play area was a "soft-spoken gentle soul", his son has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jalal Uddin, 64, died from a head injury on 18 February after being found in South Street, a few streets away from the Jalalia JaamÃ© Mosque where he worshipped.
His son said he was a "selfless man of principle", who was "kind and caring".
A 21-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy are being held on suspicion of murder.
It is understood Mr Uddin was a qari, or Koran reader, at the mosque and he was believed to have been on his way home from a friend's house when he was assaulted.
Mr Uddin's son said he was a "soft-spoken gentle soul, who wouldn't hesitate to help those in need" and "was a loved and integral part of the community".
"He was a simple man, but respected by all for his kind and caring nature... who always strived to do the right thing," he said.
He added the "events" which led to his father's death "were completely unexpected and incredibly inhumane".
