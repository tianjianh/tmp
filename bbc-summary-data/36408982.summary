County Down-based property firm Wirefox has bought another office complex in Belfast city centre.

The firm has taken control of Longbridge House in the Cathedral Quarter for a mixed-use redevelopment.
Michael Wright, director of asset management at Wirefox, said the top three floors of the building offer about 16,000 sq ft of Grade A office space.
Last month, the firm bought the Oxford and Gloucester House office complex.
Wirefox is based in Holywood and is controlled by the businessman BJ Eastwood.
Last year, the firm bought substantial housing development lands near Lisburn in County Antrim.
Another firm associated with Mr Eastwood, Dialectic Partners, also bought a property portfolio from the US investment fund Cerberus.
Longbridge House was bought from Straben Developments for an undisclosed sum.
Meanwhile, Straben has managed to retake control of another Belfast office development that had been placed into receivership last year.
Adelaide Exchange was put into receivership by Ulster Bank and the Lone Star investment fund.
Straben has raised money from a new financial backer, which allowed it to buy the building back.
