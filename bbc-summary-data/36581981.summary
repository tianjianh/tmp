After a rain-ruined first day, Joe Leach gave the visitors an early edge when he removed Hamish Rutherford and Chesney Hughes in the same over.
But, from 13-2, the hosts recovered to post 319-3 by the end of the day.
Godleman reached a career-best 157 not out, aided by 109 from Madsen, his predecessor as Derbyshire captain.
The home side, who had been put in by Worcestershire captain Daryl Mitchell, will resume on day three needing 81 runs from 14 overs to claim full batting bonus points.
Godleman recorded the 10th first-class century of his career, but he and Madsen fell 65 short of the county's best third-wicket stand - the unbroken 315 put on by Adrian Rollins and Kim Barnett against Leicestershire in 1997.
Derbyshire captain Billy Godleman:
"If you had said to me this morning when we lost those couple of early wickets that I would be not out at the end of the day I would have taken it with both hands.
"They bowled well up front. It was difficult for the first hour and then, in the second hour, it was hard to score even though the ball stopped swinging.
"I love batting with Wayne. He's a fantastic player, a very good friend of mine and has been incredibly helpful and supportive with my own personal career.
"I'd made 130 a couple of times before so to pass that was nice but most importantly we are in a strong position at the end of day two."
Worcestershire assistant coach Matt Mason told BBC H & W:
"It looked pretty bright at 2 for 13 and then there was a very close decision we thought with Madsen. We felt we were very unlucky with that one and that would have been a very different looking morning.
"But, to be fair to them, they played fantastic cricket and put on a big partnership and probably took the honours at the end.
"It did look a good wicket and if it had been the start of four days, we would probably have batted on it but we felt to be really positive and try and win the game the best chance was to try and bowl them out cheaply and hopefully only have to bat the once.
"It didn't quite work. It started like a good idea but didn't finish that way. Sometimes these things happen and the opposition are entitled to play well."
