The visitors had the better of the first half with striker Billy Paynter testing home keeper Joe Day.
Newport were much improved after the break and Medy Elito's long-range shot was saved by Trevor Carson.
Newport have moved up to 17th in the table and are 14 points clear of the relegation zone.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales:
"I don't think we got going and we looked a bit leggy. The fantastic win on Saturday [against Portsmouth] took a lot out of us.
"It was going to be a scrap, they're on a good run themselves. I'm pleased with a point - it's a point closer to where we want to be.
"I still don't think we're safe. There's 10 games left to go and a lot of points to play for."
