Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham is one of the oldest swimming baths in Britain, but is scheduled to close as part of council cuts.
A photographic project to commemorate the Grade II* listed building culminated with 110 swimmers standing in the now unused Gala pool.
Attilio Fiumarella said it had been easy to persuade people to pose-up.
The Birmingham-based photographer said: "It was the first thing I imagined when I first entered this wonderful building."
He said it marked the end of a five-month project that had revealed some "amazing stories" and people's "emotional connection with the building".
Kate Wilcox was one of those to get involved on Sunday.
"It was fantastic. It took a long time to set up, but people were so patient and encouraging," she said.
"People were so up for being involved in this because of their affection for this pool. It's great to be part of it.
"I've been using the baths for 20 months now and when I discovered they were planning to close it I was appalled because it's a heritage building.
"The new library and the symphony hall are wonderful, but we should treasure our heritage. Moseley Road Baths should be a national treasure."
Birmingham City Council previously said the closure of nine leisure centres, including Moseley Road, would help to save Â£6.8m from its leisure budget.
The local authority said it was too expensive to refurbish old sites, but that they would be replaced by new facilities.
