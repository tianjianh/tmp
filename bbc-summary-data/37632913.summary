Gayle Newland: Woman accused of posing as man wins appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman jailed after being accused of posing as a man to dupe a female friend into having sex with her, has had her conviction quashed at the Court of Appeal in London.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gayle Newland was jailed for eight years on 12 November after being convicted of three sexual assaults.
The 26-year-old from Willaston, Cheshire watched proceedings via video link from prison, and wept as the decision was announced.
She has been released on bail.
The appeal was allowed on the basis of direction given to the jury by the judge at her trial at Chester Crown Court last year and a re-trial ordered.
