[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The second dog that ran away from a crashed car has been found after being missing for nearly two days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Linda Camborne-Paynter's two terriers escaped from her car after the crash at about 18:00 GMT on Thursday outside Sweetshouse near Lostwithiel, Cornwall.
Dexter - who was found yesterday - had joined the search for his brother Snowey this morning.
Mrs Camborne-Paynter is still in hospital having broken both her arms in the crash.
The family had launched a campaign to find Snowey, including issuing a poster which said the dog had "pegged it" because he was nervous.
