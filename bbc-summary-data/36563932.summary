Britain's Lizzie Armitstead won stage three of the Women's Tour - from Ashbourne to Chesterfield - and claimed the leader's yellow jersey.

The reigning world champion sprinted clear of a four-rider breakaway group to finish narrowly ahead of main rivals South African Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio and Italy's Elisa Longo Borghini.
Armitstead holds a five-second general classification lead over Moolman-Pasio.
Saturday's stage is a 119km ride from Nottingham to Stoke-on-Trent.
"My team-mate was in the breakaway early on and my tactic was to get across to her," said Armitstead, who gained 36 seconds on previous leader Marianne Vos, who now lies in fifth place.
"I attacked with two other girls - the strongest in the race - and it was an elimination process towards the finish," she added. "I attacked the cobbles first and got over the line."
The Tour finishes in Kettering on Sunday.
