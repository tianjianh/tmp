[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers Belles have been relegated from Women's Super League 1 after being beaten at home by Notts County Ladies.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South Yorkshire side, who have lost all 14 of their games, knew before kick-off that only victory would keep their survival hopes alive.
Carla Humphrey gave Belles hope when she slotted them into an early lead.
But Aileen Whelan and Jess Clarke fired home to send Doncaster down after one season in the top flight.
Whelan lashed home to equalise after Anna Moorhouse denied Jade Moore when Doncaster failed to clear Jo Potter's free-kick.
Moments later striker Clarke cut in from the left and curled an effort past Moorhouse and into the top right-hand corner.
Doncaster manager Emma Coates told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra:
"There is no denying having relegation confirmed hurts. I feel for the girls because I thought we should have got something from the game.
"They were two poor goals to concede after getting ourselves into a great position after going 1-0 up again. It's been the story of our season.
"The fans have been brilliant. We're bottom of the league without a point but we don't have the lowest attendance.
"We haven't given them a lot to cheer about but you can see how much the club means to them. It's just a shame that we couldn't stay in the league."
