The 36-year-old was sacked from his first managerial post at League One club Oldham in January after just 20 games in charge.
Former midfielder Dunn, who won one England cap in 2002, joined Rovers aged eight and made 377 appearances in two spells at Ewood Park.
"I don't have to say how much this club means to me," he told the club website.
"I think everyone knows what Blackburn Rovers means to me personally.
"I'm looking forward to learning from the manager, as well as Alan Irvine and Rob Kelly who are some of the best coaches around."
Meanwhile, Blackburn boss Paul Lambert has called for a winter break to be introduced into English football.
The 46-year-old made five changes for the FA Cup loss to West Ham and then six changes for Wednesday's defeat by Derby as they have a run of 10 games in 32 days.
"I would have it," Lambert told BBC Radio Lancashire when asked about the break. "I've experienced it and I know it's brilliant.
"It's really refreshing, you go away and you come back and you've done another pre-season.
"It gives everyone so much recovery from long-term injuries, for people mentally and it gives everyone a break."
