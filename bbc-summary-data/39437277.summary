Visitors to the Herne Hill Velodrome in south London will have their experience enhanced by changing facilities and a club room as the new pavilion opened its doors on 30 March.

The pavilion is the final piece of a renovation project at the former Olympic venue [1948] that began in four years ago as part of the legacy project from the most recent London Games.
Since then, refurbishment of the main 450m track, the addition of a 250m junior track and new floodlights have helped double visitor numbers.
The Herne Hill track was where Sir Bradley Wiggins began his racing career, aged 12.
Hillary Peachey, chairman of the Herne Hill Velodrome Trust (HHVT), said: "It has been a long journey, but I am immensely proud of how the community came together, matched by the generosity of our funders, the project team and the local residents."
Alongside substantial contributions from the London Marathon Charitable Trust, Southwark Council and City Hall, Sport England provided £750,000 of Lottery funds towards construction, while a recent crowdfunding initiative organised by the Friends of the HHV raised £89,000 to fit out the pavilion.
The opening of the facility was attended by Brian Cookson, president of world cycling's governing body the UCI, plus dignitaries including former sport and Olympics minister Baroness Tessa Jowell, MP for Dulwich and West Norwood Helen Hayes, and London's Deputy Mayor for Transport Val Shawcross,
The velodrome hosts a range of activities for different ages and abilities, including dedicated sessions for young children, women, veterans (40+) and free drop-in sessions for the disabled through charity Wheels for Wellbeing. Visit the HHV website for details of times and pricing.
