Brexit court case: Ministers 'have no right to trigger Article 50'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The EU referendum result does not give ministers the power to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament, the Supreme Court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The lawyer acting against the government said the "political significance" of June's vote was "irrelevant" to the legal battle.
But the government says a Parliamentary vote is not necessary before invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
It is appealing against the High Court ruling it lost last month.
Although the result could complicate the government's triggering of the process for the UK leaving the EU it is not expected to stop Brexit happening.
On Tuesday afternoon it was the turn of Lord Pannick, who is representing lead appellant Gina Miller, to make his case.
He said:
Earlier the government's lawyer, James Eadie QC, said ministers could prepare a "one-line act" if they are forced to consult Parliament before triggering Brexit, and "certainly won't" set out possible arguments and how it intends to negotiate.
"The solution in legal terms is a one-line act," he said, adding: "It may be that would lead to all sorts of Parliamentary complications and possible additions and amendments and so on, but that's the solution."

Mr Eadie, who had been addressing the court since the case began on Monday morning, brought his arguments to a close by summing up why the government thinks it is entitled to use executive powers to trigger Article 50.
He said:
This second day of the Supreme Court Brexit battle was like Men's final day at Wimbledon: two massive hitters, James Eadie for the government and David Pannick for the main claimant, smashing legal balls around the court. Were there any aces?
Lord Pannick was full of rhetorical flourishes. He argued the 1972 Act to join the then EEC had created a "new legal order" that created unique and unprecedented rights that can't be swept away by ministers. Only Parliamentarians, he said, have that right - and ministers had even told them in 2015 that the referendum wasn't necessarily binding.
But Mr Eadie warned that if the Supreme Court did not let ministers have their way, the right to trigger Article 50, the justices could be crossing the line into making law themselves - something they are not there to do.
Lord Pannick continues tomorrow and he will try to batter home an argument that he says is "so obvious, so basic" - that how we leave the EU is a matter for Parliament - not ministers.
The government says it will trigger Article 50 by the end of March, which begins two years of formal Brexit talks.
It has said it will keep its cards close to its chest ahead of the negotiations, and has so far revealed little about what it will demand.
Campaigners, led by Ms Miller and hairdresser Deir Dos Santos, say triggering Article 50 requires Parliamentary approval, and won at the High Court last month.
The government has appealed to the Supreme Court, whose decision is expected in January.
Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about the court case during her visit to Bahrain.
"We wait to hear what the Supreme Court judgement is going to be but I'm clear that what government will be delivering and what Parliament will be delivering is on the will of the British people," she told the BBC.
Also on Tuesday, Lord Keen QC, the UK government's Scottish legal adviser, told the court Holyrood's consent was not needed before Brexit negotiations formally get under way.
The Scottish government believes it should be consulted before talks between the UK and EU begin, and its top law officer will be putting its case later in the week.
But Lord Keen said the Scottish government's argument was "fatally undermined" by powers over foreign affairs being reserved to Westminster.
He said it was plain from the legislation setting up the Scottish Parliament that it had no authority over matters of international relations, such as EU membership.
John Larkin QC, Attorney General for Northern Ireland, agreed with Lord Keen that the triggering of Article 50 by the UK Government fell within the royal prerogative.
The Brexit court case is pitting some of the country's top legal brains against each other.
First up, for the government, was James Eadie, the government's chosen QC, a role known as "Treasury Devil".
According to his chambers, the Cambridge-educated barrister is "the government's silk of choice for its most demanding and significant cases".  Appointed to the role in 2009, his appearances acting for the government include during the Leveson inquiry into the press and the 7/7 bombings inquests.
On the other side is Lord Pannick, a member of the same chambers as Mr Eadie, who is a crossbench peer.
Educated at Oxford, he is described as "simply the best advocate of his generation", and acted in many high-profile public law cases. His previous clients include the Queen, and he has acted both for and against the UK government in the European Court of Human Rights.
