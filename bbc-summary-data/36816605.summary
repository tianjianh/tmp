The struggle for this symbolic landmark, which connects Europe and Asia, resulted in fierce fighting between the two sides.
A new day dawns in Istanbul, and this man's expression, as he stands on the Bosphorus Bridge on Saturday morning, reflects the determination of many Turkish people to quash the attempted coup.
One of the first signs to the outside world that there was unrest brewing in Turkey on Friday evening was when soldiers blocked off the Bosphorus Bridge, a vital part of the city's network.
Apart from being strategically important, taking control of the bridge was a significant statement of intent by the coup leaders.
Cars were stranded for a time on the bridge, due to the military closing it.
President Erdogan urged people to get onto the streets in Ankara and Istanbul, to combat the coup - and many of them flocked to the bridge. The soldiers shot at them and there were some casualties.
The crowds confronted the soldiers during the standoff, and were fired upon.
People took cover near the bridge's entrance.
By dawn, the rebellion had begun to falter and police moved in with a water cannon to disperse the soldiers holding the bridge.
Early on Saturday morning, the soldiers surrendered to police.
Some of the crowds attacked the soldiers after they laid down their arms.
Police attempted to stop the crowds from assaulting the surrendered men - but were not always successful.
The police took away the soldiers after their surrender.
With the coup now failed, the crowds took to the bridge in large numbers.
The people clambered onto the army's tanks, abandoned on the Bosphorus Bridge.
The bridge was now back under control of the Turkish government - and these men were able to walk onto it and take a selfie.
