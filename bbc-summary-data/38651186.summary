Ramirez, 26, has scored nine goals in 35 games since joining from Southampton, initially on loan before signing permanently last summer.
However, the Uruguay international has been linked with a move to Leicester.
"It's just rumours. I can't understand why he wouldn't (still be at the club)," Karanka told BBC Tees.
"He's been an important player here in the last year, he's really pleased to be here."
Boro, who have already signed Rudy Gestede from Aston Villa, have been strongly linked with re-signing striker Patrick Bamford from Chelsea.
