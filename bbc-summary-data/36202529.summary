Barrow want to retain Andy Cook but expect the striker to explore opportunities in the Football League, says manager Paul Cox.

Cook, 25, scored 25 goals in the National League last season, helping the Bluebirds to a mid-table finish.
He returned to Holker Street after a stint at Grimsby in July 2014.
"The lad wants to play League football and I can't and won't have a go at players who want to play at a higher level," Cox told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"There are clubs at our level who have come in for him, but his agent has categorically said he doesn't want to sign for another Conference club.
"It's one we might need to be patient on."
