Queens Park Rangers 3-0 Leeds United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
QPR opened their Championship campaign with a comfortable win against Leeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rangers led early through a scrappy goal from a corner, with Nedum Onuoha appearing to bundle in from a yard out.
Onuoha almost provided a second goal before the interval, but Sebastian Polter saw his low left-footed shot hit a post from the defender's ball in.
Tjaronn Chery's penalty made it 2-0 after Ronaldo Vieira clumsily fouled Jordan Cousins, before Polter fired in a third with the game's final touch.
New Leeds head coach Garry Monk saw his side get off to the worse possible start within four minutes.
The visitors, including former QPR goalkeeper Rob Green on debut, failed to clear a corner and Onuoha was among a number of bodies competing inside the six-yard box for the decisive final touch.
QPR striker Polter caused Leeds' defence problems and twice hit the upright in the opening 45 minutes as the visitors looked off the pace.
Monk's side showed glimpses of an attacking threat in the second half, but Â£3m summer signing Kemar Roofe was among those who struggled to impose themselves.
Another new recruit, Swedish striker Marcus Antonsson, missed perhaps their best chance at 2-0 behind when he failed to hit the target with a one-on-one against QPR goalkeeper Alex Smithies.
Leeds' misery was compounded with Polter's strike just before full-time, as the German volleyed home from a tight angle.
QPR head coach Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: "It was a good start. Perfect? No. But it was a good start as we were organised, had control in the first half and especially in the second.
"Half-time came at the right time for us but then in the second half we controlled it, had more energy and we played really well.
"We only gave away one chance really with our sloppiness and it was a good performance where we can have a look and work on things we need to improve and get better at."
Leeds head coach Garry Monk: "It is obviously disappointing and not the start we wanted.
"But this is just one game and I am confident we have the quality and the character in the group.
"It's a process and I said when I walked in that it's not going to happen overnight. I trust all my players and trust they're good enough and will improve."
