[SN]TITLE[SN]
County Championship: Essex cruise to innings win over Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Essex strengthened their position at the top of Division Two by beating Derbyshire by an innings and 62 runs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derbyshire were bowled out for 303 in their second innings at Derby.
Essex began day four needing five more wickets for victory and Ravi Bopara (3-39) removed Callum Parkinson and Alex Mellor in the opening over.
Charlie MacDonell (35 not out) and Matt Critchley (43) resisted with an eighth-wicket stand of 72 but Graham Napier (4-50) wrapped up the win before lunch.
Napier's haul made him the first bowler to take 50 wickets in the County Championship this season.
It is the first time the 36-year-old, who is retiring at the end of the season, has reached the milestone.
