The accident happened at 15:45 BST on Friday outside Monkey World on Tout Hill in Dorset.
Alan Gerald Thomas, from Edgware, north London, was walking when he was hit by a blue Toyota Rav 4, driven by a 65-year-old man from the Wareham area.
Mr Thomas is in Southampton Hospital in a life-threatening condition.
Police Sergeant Fern Graham said: "We have made a number of enquiries to find Mr Thomas's next of kin but have so far been unsuccessful.
"We believe he has a sister but he has not been in contact with her for some time and we don't know where she lives.
"I am hoping that by releasing Alan's photo that someone may be able to give us some information about his next of kin."
The road was closed for a number of hours to allow investigators to examine the scene.
