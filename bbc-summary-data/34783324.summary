The airport is putting its planning to the test with a simulated explosion at its fuel farm.
During the scenario being tested later, a helicopter will also be reported missing.
Chief executive Gordon Dewar said the airport is committed to the highest possible safety standards.
The live exercise, he added, is an opportunity to learn.
