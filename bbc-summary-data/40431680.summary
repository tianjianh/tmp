The Canadian singer appeared at the Principality Stadium, with the gates opening at 17:30 BST and the event ending after 22:30.
Some nearby roads were shut for periods between 18:00 and 23:00.
Those coming by car were urged to use a park-and-ride at Cardiff City Stadium, as city centre car parks were expected to be busy.
Westgate Street, Park Street and Scott Road shut at 18:00 and after the gig, closures were extended to cover parts of Cowbridge Road East, Castle Street, Duke Street and Wood Street.
There was a post-event queuing system at Cardiff Central Station and limited extra services after the concert.
