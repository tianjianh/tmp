The 33-year-old tighthead had a year left to run on his current deal but was released with the Coventry-based club well stocked in the front-row.
After leaving Treviso for Wasps in 2014, he went onto make 35 Premiership appearances in two seasons.
"Citta has been outstanding for Wasps," director of rugby Dai Young said. "He's a fantastic character to have around."
"Because he's such a good guy and been so good for Wasps, we didn't want to stand in his way when he had the opportunity to secure a longer-term deal elsewhere."
Compatriot Andrea Masi recently retired while Carlo Festuccia also left the club to end the Italian link with the Wasps club.
Cittadini, who has been involved with the Italy side's summer series against the USA, moves to a Bayonne side that just won promotion back to the Top 14 after a season in France's Pro D2.
"It was a very difficult decision to take," Cittadini said. "I feel very sad about leaving the club, but I want to look at this move as a very good opportunity in the last few years of my career.
"It is an exciting step and challenge in my rugby career and it is also a good opportunity for me and my wife as a family."
