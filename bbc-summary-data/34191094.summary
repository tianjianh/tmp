[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh government and universities have pledged £10m, with £7m of EU cash.
This is on top of a £50m scheme to bring world-leading scientists here, which has seen four appointments.
Economy and Science Minister Edwina Hart said: "Science underpins innovation and technology development, which is essential for economic growth and creating high-quality jobs."
These research fellows will work with researchers based at Cardiff, Swansea, Aberystwyth and Bangor universities, as well as the University of South Wales.
Prof Richard B Davies, vice-chancellor of Swansea University, said: "The funding provides a timely opportunity for Welsh universities to build upon the excellent science base we already have by attracting experienced research fellows from other countries."
