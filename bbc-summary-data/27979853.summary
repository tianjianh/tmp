The 2011 champion defeated world number 56 Andrey Golubev of Kazakhstan 6-0 6-1 6-4 in one hour and 28 minutes.
Sixth seed Tomas Berdych from the Czech Republic survived an early scare before advancing to the next round.
There were also wins for 12th seed Ernests Gulbis, 17th seed Mikhail Youzhny and Queen's Club champion Grigor Dimitrov, the 11th seed.
But Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, seeded 18th, is out.

Verdasco led Andy Murray two sets to love before losing to the eventual champion in last year's quarter-finals, but was beaten 6-4 4-6 6-4 6-2 by Australia's world number 58 Marinko Matosevic.
Matosevic, who was born in Bosnia-Hercegovina, underlined his grass-court credentials by beating both Marin Cilic and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at Queen's.
Djokovic controlled his match throughout to set up a second-round meeting with Czech veteran Radek Stepanek.
"It was a great start, especially the first two sets and I could not be happier with the performance," said the Serb, who has not won a Grand Slam since the 2013 Australian Open.
"But credit to Andrey for coming back and playing some good tennis in the third set."
Berdych, the 2010 finalist, lost the first set before beating Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-7 (5-7) 6-1 6-4 6-3.
Gulbis came through 7-6 7-5 7-6 against Estonian Zopp, while Youzhny outclassed British number two James Ward 6-2 6-2 6-1.
Dmitrov was also a straight-sets winner, defeating American Ryan Harrison 7-6 6-3 6-2 to continue his good form on grass.

"It was a great feeling to be out there and it was a great day to be out there and I'm happy to start that way," the Bulgarian told BBC Sport.
"It is a good start and I am looking forward to the next round.
"Winning at Queen's has given me confidence and recently my form has been good but this is a different tournament."
Seventh seed David Ferrer of Spain also advanced with a 6-0 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-1 victory over compatriot Pablo Carreno-Busta.
