Newcastle's European Challenge Cup hopes hang by a thread after a last-gasp defeat in south-east France.

Chris Harris went over as the visitors led 10-7 at half-time, despite David Melee's try for Top 14 side Grenoble.
After being pegged back, Craig Willis converted after Calum Green's try and added a penalty for a 10-point lead.
But a Grenoble penalty try led to Green being sin-binned, with Etienne Fourcade and Fabrice Estebanez scoring either side of Scott Wilson's try for victory.
Newcastle are 10 points behind pool leaders Ospreys, who host Lyon on Sunday, with only the side finishing top guaranteed a place in the knockout stages of the competition.
Harris' try came on his return from an ankle injury as Dean Richards named a completely changed starting XV, while the bonus-point win still leaves Grenoble adrift at the bottom.
Grenoble: Dardet; Heguy, Edwards, Capelli, Hand; Marie, Kornath; Hayes, Mele, Bosch, Dupont, Gelin, Estebanez, Batlle.
Replacements: Fourcade, Jacquot, Rossouw, Jolmes, Kimlin, Saseras, Guillemin, Waqa.
Newcastle: Connon; Marshall, C Harris, Burdon (capt), Kibirige; Willis, Egerton; B Harris, Sowrey, D Wilson, Witty, Botha, Robinson, Orr, Temm.
Replacements: Cooper, Brocklebank, S Wilson, Green, G Young, M Young, Waldouck, Catterick.
