Tourist board Visit England will be launching an advert to showcase areas of the country, including Skegness, where people would like to visit.
East Lindsey District Council said extra visitors would boost the economy.
The commercial would run between March and June on the back of forthcoming events such as the Olympic Games.
A celebrity-led 60 second commercial, promoting special deals across Britain, will be supported by a series of adverts focusing on specific destinations of which Skegness is one.
Councillor Craig Leyland, portfolio holder for the economy for the district council, said: "We need to raise the profile of our district and encourage more people to visit our area for the benefit of our economy and this campaign, coupled with our connections to London 2012, will help do just that.
"We must embrace 2012 and the opportunities it provides to promote our area and the excellent events we have planned through East Lindsey Live and SO Festival, plus the Olympic Torch Relay on June 27."
The advert would also run on the back of other events this year including the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and The Torch Relay.
Skegness attracts over four million visitors each year, generating over Â£450m for the local economy.
