The 30-year-old, South Africa-born Canada international, has scored 57 tries in 128 games in his career.
Van der Merwe won the Pro-12 with Glasgow Warriors in 2014-15.
"DTH is a top-class finisher," director of rugby Dean Richards said. "He has averaged almost a try every other game in the Pro 12."
Van der Merwe, whose contract terms are undisclosed, will join up with Canada team-mate Evan Olmstead at Kingston Park.
"The pace and flair Newcastle are showing right now is creating a lot of opportunities out wide, and hopefully I can get myself on the end of some of those moves," he said.
Falcons will lose winger Marcus Watson and prop Ben Harris to Wasps in 2017-18 it was also announced on Wednesday.
