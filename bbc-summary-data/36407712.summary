England went soft after World Cup win - Eddie Jones

England's lack of success since winning the 2003 World Cup is a result of the team being allowed to develop a soft underbelly, says coach Eddie Jones.

Until Jones guided England to a first Grand Slam in 13 years, they had won just one Six Nations title since lifting the World Cup trophy in Sydney.
"When I was Wallabies coach in 2004, they came out for a holiday," he said. "We put 50 points on them in Brisbane.
"You cannot accept that. England rugby has never recovered."
England travel to Australia to take on the beaten World Cup finalists in a three-Test series next month with games on 11, 18 and 25 June.
When asked if the team had become soft since 2003, Jones said: "Without a doubt."
The Australian, who succeeded Stuart Lancaster as England coach in December, acknowledged that "significant senior players retired at the same time", but added: "Commercial activity took over for England's players after that World Cup success.
"I don't mind players having agents and agents doing good things for them. If you play the game well - and that means training well - you should get financial rewards.
"It's when they start taking short cuts, going to a function instead of having proper recovery, that I have a problem."
Australia have won nine of the 15 meetings between the sides since England beat them in the World Cup final 13 years ago, including four out of five on home soil.
Jones has impressed upon his players they need to "give it everything" as they continue to take "baby steps".
"I've said to the players: 'If you do not want to come on tour and work hard, stay at home.' Go to Portugal, Spain, Tunisia, Egypt, wherever you want and have a great time.
"It is a choice you make. We've got three difficult Tests and we know that Australia have picked a strong squad.
"It's not about players having a nasty edge, but being desperate to play for England. That's what I want.
"Owen Farrell would be top of the tree and he is from Wigan. It's all about how desperate you are and George Ford is the same.
"They are kids who desperately want to play for England and get better. They are the players we want.
"There is no doubt that players have had it too easy and been handed caps."
