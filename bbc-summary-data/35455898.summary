The 23-year-old only joined the Magpies from Marseille last August on a five-year contract for a reported Â£12m.
"There is no option for purchase within the deal, so Thauvin will return to Newcastle at the end of the loan," said a statement on the Newcastle website.
Thauvin made 16 appearances, with 11 as substitute, for the Tyneside club and scored one goal.
Newcastle have signed midfielders Andros Townsend and Jonjo Shelvey this month.
