[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 2-1 Blackburn Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aston Villa continued their revival under Steve Bruce with victory at home to struggling Blackburn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a goalless first half, Blackburn took a 54th-minute lead when unmarked Sam Gallagher headed home Charlie Mulgrew's left-wing cross.
But Villa drew level three minutes later when Gordon Greer brought down Jack Grealish and Jonathan Kodjia converted from the spot.
The Ivory Coast striker doubled his tally to hand Villa all three points.
Kodjia was criticised by Birmingham manager Gary Rowett for the number of times he went to ground in last week's derby.
But his 71st-minute strike, following Mile Jedinak's assist, proved the difference and ensured Villa remain the only Championship side not to be beaten at home this season.
They climb up to 14th in the table and are now unbeaten in five games under Bruce.
Blackburn remain 23rd and have now lost three games in a row.
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:  "I thought Kodjia probably had his best game for the club and hopefully we can continue moving upwards.
"You only have to watch him and realise what a good player he is. He has that little trick of playing on the side, like the French - and this helps me getting an extra striker onto the pitch.
"We didn't do enough in the first half, although we started the second half much brighter when we played with a bit of energy and fire.
"It was a big test going behind and not playing well. Thankfully, we responded in the right manner and started looking like a team."
Blackburn boss Owen Coyle: "In the first half we dominated the game and could have been two goals ahead.
"Sam is a very talented young player who I believe will play in the Premier League.
"I've told the players, and I was quite vocal about it, that they must not give away soft goals when we are in a winning position.
"There is enough in the team to know we will move up the table. It is frustrating because we are performing well against good teams and it is hard to leave without any points."
