[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The firm which took over First Group bus routes in the Scottish Borders is asking its customers to help it improve its services.

Borders Buses said it had spent Â£3.5m on new vehicles and information and ticketing systems in the region.
It has now launched an online survey and will be staging drop-in sessions to assess the views of its passengers.
First Group decided to sell its services earlier this year blaming competition from the Borders Railway.
Sharon Morrison, commercial manager at West Coast Motors, parent company of Borders Buses, said: "We are committed to delivering a reliable bus service which meets the travel needs of our customers.
"Therefore, the best way to find out if our customers are satisfied with the service is to engage with them directly.
"Face to face is always the best way, however we understand work and family obligations make it difficult for people to attend the drop-in sessions so the online survey is a simple and easy way to provide feedback and suggestions."
Future drop-in sessions are planned in Hawick, Melrose, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Kelso and Peebles later this month.
