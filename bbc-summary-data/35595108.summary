[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers said it appeared that the men worked together to distract staff, allowing one of them to steal from behind the counter.
The three men ran from the premises following the theft and were last seen running along Aberfoyle's Main Street.
The theft took place on Tuesday afternoon at about 13:00 and the suspects were captured on CCTV.
The three men were all white, with the first described as aged between 40 and 50, 5ft 7in tall, of heavy build, clean shaven and wearing a black baseball cap.
The second male was described as between 20 and 30, 6ft, slim, with collar-length brown hair, wearing jeans and a jacket and of "scruffy" appearance.
The third male was about 40 and heavily built.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: "The inquiry so far has the three suspects on CCTV outside the post office before they enter, and a short time later running along Main Street on the footpath.
"It is not known if the three got into a car to leave the village."
