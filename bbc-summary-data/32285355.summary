Stepping Hill deaths: Victorino Chua wrote of 'devil in me'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A letter in which a nurse accused of poisoning patients wrote "there's a devil in me" has been shown in court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victorino Chua, 49, denies murdering three patients and poisoning 18 others at Stepping Hill Hospital, Greater Manchester between 2011 and 2012.
The handwritten document was found in his kitchen after his arrest in 2012.
The letter read it was "the bitter nurse confession" and he had been prescribed sleeping tablets and anti-depressants.
Manchester Crown Court heard that the defendant told police he wrote the letter after a counselling session in which he was told to write down his feelings as an outlet for his frustrations.
In the letter, the nurse says he is writing it in case something happens to him and so people can "work out how an angel turn to an evil person".
The father-of-two ended the 13-page document by writing: "Still inside of me I can feel the anger that any time it will explode just still hanging on can still control it but if I will be pushed they gonna be sorry."
He added: "The bitter nurse confession. Got lots to tell but I just take it to my grave."
Mr Chua, of Churchill Street, Stockport, is charged with killing Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Alfred Weaver, 83.
He is alleged to have killed his victims by secretly injecting insulin into saline bags.
He has pleaded not guilty to a total of 37 charges, including 25 counts of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent, eight counts of attempting to administer poison and one count of administering poison.
The alleged offences happened between June 2011 and January 2012.
The trial continues.
