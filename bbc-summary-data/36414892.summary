"There is no shame in political leaders going back on their decision when they have made a mistake, to create the conditions to discuss social progress in this country," the trade unionist added.
Centre-left Le Monde says the authorities are attempting to "splinter the various fronts" (all links in French) in the strike by making them separate offers.

Conservative Le Figaro criticises the approach as "saying yes to everything and squandering public money".
