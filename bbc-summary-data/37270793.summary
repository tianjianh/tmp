Having led the country to their first major finals in 30 years at Euro 2016, it was widely expected the manager would land a top-level club post.
"A few of us have said we are surprised a club has not come in for him," West Bromwich Albion player Evans revealed.
O'Neill's men start their 2018 World Cup qualifying with a tricky clash away to the Czech Republic on Sunday.
It is Northern Ireland's first match since their European exit at the hands of Wales in the last 16 of the summer championship.
Former Brechin City and Shamrock Rovers manager O'Neill's stock rose when Northern Ireland graced the high-profile knock-out stage in France.
However, he was overlooked for the various posts which popped up in England and Scotland.
Centre-back Evans, 28, is grateful O'Neill will be leading Northern Ireland in their pursuit to reach Russia in 2018 as he feared losing him following the 1-0 defeat by the Welsh in Paris.
"It has been strange no-one has come in for him," added Evans.
"He is in a great position and I think no matter what happens in this campaign he will always be in a strong position.
"We are all really fond of the manager, we would all like to see him being given that chance to go and prove himself at club level. I do not think we would hold it against him if he did move on and manage a club.
"We are grateful as players that we have him for this campaign because we know the hunger he has and it has a big impact on us."
O'Neill extended his contract with the Irish Football Association by four years in March.
However, it includes a condition that he can be prised away from the deal for a release fee of Â£750,000.
