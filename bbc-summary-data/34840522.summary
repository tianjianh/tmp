The Yellows dominated possession but were caught on the break by Lenell John-Lewis who fired in spectacularly from 25 yards just before the interval.
Pat Hoban rewarded Oxford's dominance when he turned and fired-in the equaliser in the 72nd minute.
But County almost claimed all the points when Aaron Collins had a shot blocked in stoppage time.
Newport stay in 21st position, but are now unbeaten in eight league and cup games under manager John Sheridan, while Oxford remain second, two points behind Plymouth.
Oxford United manager Michael Appleton told BBC Radio Oxford:

"The result was frustrating, but the second-half performance I thought was magnificent.
"We've had some good performances here recently, but the second half I thought they were outstanding.
"We got the one goal, very unfortunate not to find the second, but I couldn't have asked any more from them.
"The whole place just seemed a little but flat in the first half and I asked them to get on the front foot a bit quicker and it looked really exciting after the break.
"Newport are a side that John Sheridan's got well-organised, they came here tonight to get the point they wanted and it was a fantastic finish for them.
"Sometimes you've got to hold your hands up when someone puts one in the stanchion from 30 yards."
Newport manager John Sheridan:
"I think Oxford were the better side and put us on the back foot for a lot of the second half, but I was very pleased with the way we played first half.
"It's a good point because they are going well. I just think that if we believed ourselves a little more and we were brave and we took care of the ball a little bit more we could have caused them more problems.
"It's just about having a bit of game know-how and seeing the game through. But we gave the ball away cheaply and you end up on the back foot."
