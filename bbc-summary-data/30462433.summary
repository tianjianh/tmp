[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The drawing of a fisherman sheltering from the rain was drawn by the then 13-year-old Charlotte in 1829.
Brontë, who wrote Jane Eyre, copied the work from a popular guidebook of British birds.
The drawing will be placed on public display in early 2015 and will be available to view in the Parsonage's exhibition in Haworth.
Charlotte Brontë was one of three sisters who lived with their brother and father, who was the vicar in Haworth, West Yorkshire during the first half of the 19th Century.
The sisters wrote a number of English literature classics, including Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall and Agnes Grey.
Ann Dinsdale, collections manager at the Brontë Parsonage, said "We're thrilled to be able to bring this drawing home to Haworth to sit with the rest of the collection of the Brontë family.
"This sketch represents the start of Charlotte's creative genius and is a rare insight into one of Britain's great literary minds."
