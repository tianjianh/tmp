At the end of trade the benchmark FTSE 100 was down 10.36 points, or 0.14%, at 7,286.56.
Travel firm Tui was the biggest riser on the index, up 5.27%, after its said first-quarter losses had narrowed.
The company was boosted by a strong rise in UK bookings, which were up by 10% in volume from a year earlier. Other winners were RBS and Capita.
Rolls-Royce was the biggest faller in the index, down 3.99% after it reported a pre-tax loss of Â£4.6bn.
The aerospace company was hit by the cost of a bribery settlement, and currency-related contracts were affected by the post-Brexit vote fall in sterling.
On the currency markets, the pound was down 0.49% against the dollar at $1.2464 and 0.25% against the euro to 1.1790 euros.
