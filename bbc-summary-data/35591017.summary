Three times the tourists led in Perth, through goals from Crista Cullen, Ellie Watton and Helen Richardson-Walsh.
Each time they were pegged back - by Gabrielle Nance, Karri McMahon and Ashleigh Nelson - to keep the series tied before Thursday's fourth match.
Captain Richardson-Walsh won her 355th cap to equal Karen Brown's all-time record.
"I felt my 35 years old out there," she said. "It's a massive honour to equal Karen Brown's record.
"It feels like we've been talking about it for a while so I can't wait to break the record. It'll be really nice to get there - a really huge honour."
