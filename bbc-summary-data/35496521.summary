Leinster winger Elise O'Byrne-White and Munster hooker Zoe Grattage will win their first caps, with flanker Ciara Griffin named among the replacements.
In all, the defending champions have 10 players who will be involved in a Six Nations fixture for the first time.
Ireland lost 15-5 to Wales in a warm-up fixture two weeks ago.
The Irish squad features seven players who won made their first appearances in last November's autumn international against England, with Aine Donnelly and Mairead Coyne included in the starting line-up.
Cliodhna Mooney, Lindsay Peat, Fiona Reidy, Ciara Cooney and Mary Healy will be looking to add a second cap to their collection from the bench.
"It's very exciting to have so many new players involved in their first Six Nations game," said Tierney.
"With some of the girls from last year's campaign involved with the Sevens at the moment, as well as some retirements over the past few seasons, it gives others the opportunity to pull on the green jersey.
"We're now at a stage where we are developing more and more girls who are capable of competing at international level and it's a great to see."
The Irish side won four of their five fixtures last year, while Wales finished fifth.
