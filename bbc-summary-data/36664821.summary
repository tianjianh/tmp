The 28-year-old, who previously had two spells on loan with the Bantams, will officially sign on 1 July after his contract with Rangers expires.
He spent three years with the Glasgow club, making 114 appearances, and helped them win promotion back to the top flight last season.
Law is Bradford's first signing since Stuart McCall returned to take charge of the League One club.
Meanwhile, defender Nathan Clarke has signed a new one-year deal to stay with the Bantams next season.
The 32-year-old made 32 appearances in all competitions last term.
Law's loan spells in 2007 and most of the 2008-09 season, came during McCall's first stint as Bantams boss, while he also played under him at Rangers and Motherwell.
"I am delighted to be coming back to Bradford, and it is a bonus that it will be with Stuart again," Law told City's website.
"The club has improved a lot since I last came here and looks to be on the up."
