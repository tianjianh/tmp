Bristol 'eyesore' sorting office site bought by council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol City Council has bought an eyesore site in the city centre, which it says will be key to one of the UK's largest urban regeneration projects.

The former sorting office site has been derelict for more than 17 years.
The mayor said the site presented an "awful arrival" for people coming in to Temple Meads station and buying it was vital to transforming the area.
The Taxpayers' Alliance has criticised Bristol's "extraordinary" commercial property portfolio.
The acquisition of the 2.1 hectare (5.2 acre) former Royal Mail site, close to the planned Â£91m arena, is seen as a key site in the Bristol Temple Enterprise Zone.
Bristol Mayor George Ferguson told BBC Bristol it had cost "under Â£6m" and marked a "real step change" in the transformation of the area behind Temple Meads station.
"It's been one of my main aims to deal with this terrible eyesore, this awful arrival to Bristol."
"When you're entering a wonderful city like Bristol from London on the Great Western Railway, you expect a much better arrival."
The Taxpayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, says the council owns buildings housing a nightclub, 25 restaurants, 22 farms and 198 shops, following a Freedom of Information request.
Spokesman Tim Newark said: "It seems ridiculous at a time when Bristol City Council is pleading poverty and putting up Council Tax that it is sitting on commercial property assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds."
Mr Ferguson said property was "a very important part of our holdings and that actually enables us to keep the taxes lower than they might otherwise be".
