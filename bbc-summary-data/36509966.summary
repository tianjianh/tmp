[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales suffered a second successive defeat on their New Zealand tour as a much-changed team were blown away by the Chiefs in Hamilton.

Brad Weber, Tom Sanders and Dominic Bird scored for the Super Rugby side in the first half, with James Lowe, Toni Pulu and Sam McNicol crossing later.
Kristian Dacey replied for Wales, for whom forward Jake Ball limped off.
Few squad players made a compelling case to Warren Gatland to be included against New Zealand on Saturday.
Sam Warburton was a late inclusion in the starting XV after Ellis Jenkins' withdrawal, so the team showed 14 changes from the side beaten 39-21 by New Zealand at Eden Park on Saturday.
Jamie Roberts also replaced Gareth Anscombe on the bench as the Kiwi-born back nursed a hip injury suffered as a replacement in Auckland, while Taulupe Faletau was a late addition among the replacements with Ross Moriarty still sore from Saturday.
Those late changes were emblematic of a disjointed Wales performance at the FMG Stadium Waikato.
Former All Black Stephen Donald stepped inside Wales flanker Josh Turnbull before offloading to Weber for the scrum-half to race under the posts after just seven minutes.
Donald added the extras and did so again after Sanders drove over on the half-hour mark.
Bird extended the two-time Super Rugby champions' lead just before half-time when he crashed over out wide after a series of surges at the tourists' line.
A string of substitutions in the second half disrupted Wales' attempted recovery, although hooker Dacey bundled over to temporarily reduce the deficit.
But the Chiefs, who were without eight All Blacks, replied through further scores from Pulu, Lowe and McNicol.
Wales were given more cause for concern with lock Ball limping off with an injury midway through the second half.
Wales coach Warren Gatland: "We were dominated at collision time and that was the difference between the teams. They were better in defence and attack.
"It probably answered a few questions in terms of those who have been knocking on our door wanting to play Test rugby.
"It was disappointing."
Wales lock Luke Charteris: "This midweek game was a chance for boys who have come on the tour to put their hand up.
"We spoke exactly of that before the game, we said we have to play as a team, not play as individuals, and obviously we didn't achieve that.
"And it's frustrating because we were given an opportunity."
