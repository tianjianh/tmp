The 19-year-old has made two appearances for the south coast team, including a debut in last season's 4-0 EFL Cup win over Colchester United.
White should be available for the League Two opening match of the season at Stevenage on Saturday.
"This is a big coup for the club and I'm delighted to get Ben in," said Newport manager Mike Flynn.
