The first device was destroyed last week by Navy divers close to Hinkley C power station in Lilstock.
On 8 August a 500lb (226kg) device was discovered 2.5 nautical miles (4.6km) from the coast, about 26ft (8m) below the surface.
The second device weighed 250lb (113kg) and was found 0.3 miles (500m) from the power station. It has also been destroyed in a controlled explosion.
A 0.6 mile (1km) exclusion was set up and The Ministry of Defence confirmed the bomb was "rendered safe with a controlled detonation" that took place at about 16.20 BST.
The coast around Lilstock was used as part of a practice bombing range for the Royal Navy.
David Eccles, EDF Energy's Head of Stakeholder Engagement for Hinkley Point C, said: "It is normal practice to check the seabed before construction activity starts on any marine project.
"The safety of the public and our workforce is our priority and we have a team of 10 divers checking the seabed ahead of the construction of the main cooling water tunnels and associated seabed structures for Hinkley Point C.
"We believe the unexploded ordnance probably dates back to the Second World War.
"As a precaution we put a cordon zone around the area and are working closely with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the Royal Navy."
