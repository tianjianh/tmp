Torquay boss Kevin Nicholson feels they can ease their relegation worries with one good week of results, after making the quarter-finals of the FA Trophy.

Nathan Smith's goal gave the Gulls a 1-0 win at Macclesfield Town and booked a quarter-final trip to Bognor Regis.
However, the Gulls slipped to 12 points from safety in the National League after Boreham Wood won at Braintree.
"We can do that, it's on for us because we've got games coming thick and fast," Gulls manager Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"I keep saying it, but one good week is all we need to get ourselves right back in the mix.
"We've got three games in hand on most of those teams now, so we go out there, we put the work rate in like this, we can go to Boreham on Saturday confident and go there to try and win the game."
Torquay reached the semi-finals of the FA Trophy last season before being knocked out by Wrexham, and Nicholson says his side are capable of making the final this year.
"This season, fifth bottom and finishing the season at Wembley and we'll go away for a great summer," he added.
"That's the target, that's what I've told them, that's all that we need to concentrate on, but we have to do it one game at a time.
"I've been a professional for nearly 20 years and I've been fortunate enough to play there twice, which is twice more than most, and I'm very grateful.
"But it's an experience that these lads have got to earn, they've earned it so far, they're still in the hat."
