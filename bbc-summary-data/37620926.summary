The prime minister's local council has said it will spend £50,000 to challenge Heathrow expansion, if the government gives third runway plans the go-ahead.

Windsor and Maidenhead Council, in Theresa May's constituency, teamed up with Hillingdon, Richmond and Wandsworth councils to fight expansion.
The Cabinet is expected to make a decision on whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick later this month.
Overall, the four councils have pledged £200,000 to the legal challenge.
Conservative leader of the Berkshire authority Simon Dudley, said £50,000 was a small amount to pay to try and "protect a million people".
He said plans to build a second runway in Gatwick was "more deliverable", adding: "We want a better not bigger Heathrow Airport, and if the legal analysis shows that government is making an unsound decision then the judicial review, if it was granted and successful, would stop an expansion of Heathrow airport."
The legal challenge will be discussed at a Maidenhead and Windsor council meeting on Thursday.
Leader of Richmond Council Lord True, said: "Making Europe's most polluting and worst located airport even bigger offends just about every environmental and security principle you can think of and will unite armies of campaigners in fierce opposition. It will never be built."
Neither Mrs May nor No 10 has outlined an official position on the proposal for a third runway at Heathrow.
