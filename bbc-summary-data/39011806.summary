[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 3-0 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Ball proved Northampton's undoing, creating one and scoring another as high-flying Fleetwood earned victory, their 17th successive game without defeat.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Cobblers made the early running and should have gone ahead, as Marc Richards got goalside of Cian Bolger, lofting a neat ball to Michael Smith who rattled the woodwork from barely five yards out.
Justin Edinburgh's side seemed determined to stamp their mark on the game, Michael Smith firing wide from close range as the high-flying hosts looked to be limping to the break.
But the game turned in a second when Adam Smith hesitated under pressure from Ball.
The Fleetwood striker's chip was gathered by Devante Cole, who was denied at the first attempt but pounced on the rebound to find the net from the tightest of angles.
Ball might easily have doubled Town's tally within minutes of the restart, another moment of uncertainty going unpunished as his shot slipped just wide of the back post.
Fleetwood did soon find their second, Bobby Grant skipping around two men and firing past Smith from the right of the six-yard box.
A second goal in the space of four minutes ended any hopes of a Cobblers comeback, Ball this time the architect and scorer.
He made the most of David Buchanan's slip, racing in from the left and picking the moment to lift the ball over the advancing Adam Smith to bag his 13th goal of the campaign.
