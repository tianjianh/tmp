Five animals that have inspired modern technology

Scientists who worked out how snakes slither on their bellies are hoping this discovery could help them come up with new, hard-wearing paints and surfaces.

They think they'll be able copy snakes' greasy layer on their bellies to create tough new materials.
But it's not the first time humans have copied animals to create new tech.
Here are Newsround's top five.
A bird-watching engineer at a Japanese rail company took inspiration from a kingfisher's beak to solve a problem with high speed trains.
When they first were invented, high-speed trains had a real problem with noise, especially in tunnels.
As they drive through, the air pressure builds up in waves and as the nose exits the tunnel there's a loud noise. But an engineer re-designed the nose to be long and pointy like the kingfisher so the airwaves were gradually released instead.
Humpback whales might be heavy, but they're actually very good swimmers.
This is down to a row of warty ridges, called tubercles, on the front edge of their fins. These bumps help the whale to swim faster and change direction more easily.
A scientist called Frank Fish spotted this and worked out a way of adding similar bumps to wind turbine blades.
He found it made the turbines go faster when the wind changed direction, creating more power.
Geckos have specially adapted feet that mean they can stick to surfaces, and recently, scientists discovered they can do this because their feet are covered in thousand of tiny elastic hairs.
A team in the US has copied the geckos and developed amazing gloves that help climbers scale vertical walls.
They're hoping that the military will be able to use them in the future to climb over tough, steep or uneven land, high buildings or steep walls.
Velcro was invented when Swiss engineer George de Mestral went for a walk with his dog in the Alps.
When they got back, George found his dog was covered in fuzzy thistle-like seeds called burrs.
Mestral studied how these burrs and hairs attached to each other with tiny hooks.
It was this that inspired him to create Velcro as a way to easily fasten things together.
Sharks have amazing skin, which works to keep them clean of algae and other hitch-hiking sea creatures.
Their skin has a special pattern on it called 'dentricles' which reduces drag and means they can glide through the sea easily.
The shark skin caught the eyes of scientists at Nasa, who copied the patterns to create a special coating.
They used it on American sailing boats in the Olympics to help them move faster through the water.
