Her attacker is believed to have followed her home on Monday after she had collected her pension from Sea Mills Post Office in Shirehampton Road.
She suffered "nasty head injuries" and is recovering in hospital after being hit several times, police said.
The victim's son, 45, was inside the home and ran to her aid. He fought with the attacker and was also struck.
An Avon and Somerset Police spokesman described the man as white, of medium-build, 25 to 29 years old, with stubble on his face and wearing a light-coloured baseball cap, and a grey long-sleeved top and jeans.
Investigating officer Det Con Andy Jones said: "This was an horrific attack on an elderly woman who was arriving home after collecting her pension.
"We believe the offender may have followed the woman from the Post Office back to her home.
"She suffered nasty head injuries and although she is recovering in hospital this attack could easily have had more serious or even fatal consequences."
