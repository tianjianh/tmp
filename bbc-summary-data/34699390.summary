Bath coach Mike Ford believes Sam Burgess will be in a positive frame of mind on his return to the club, despite speculation about his future.

The former rugby league player is believed to be considering a return to Australia's NRL.
But Burgess, 26, is now back training with Bath after the World Cup.
"I will sit down and have a chat with him. He has gone though plenty of things but it won't be a problem," Ford told BBC Points West.

"We need him. He has had his time off now and hopefully he is refreshed and ready to roll his sleeves up and work hard."
Bath are currently ninth in the Premiership table and were beaten 38-28 at home by Harlequins at the weekend.
Since the end of the World Cup, there has been speculation that Burgess - who started for England in the key defeat to Wales - will decide to return to rugby league.
And his brother Tom said on Sunday that he was "at a bit of a crossroads" over his future career.
But when asked about whether Burgess would stay with Bath, Ford replied: "Yeah, what more do you want me to say?"
Burgess has played 17 games for the club since joining them just over a year ago, scoring 20 points including four tries.
