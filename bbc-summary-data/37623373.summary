The 20-year-old opener made his debut for the Red Rose in August and hit his maiden century later that month at Old Trafford against Middlesex.
"It's a dream come true for me to play for Lancashire and I couldn't be happier," he said.
Jones will spend this winter in Australia playing grade cricket for South Perth.
He had previously been on a scholarship deal with Lancashire alongside 21-year-old bowler Danny Lamb, who has also agreed his first contract.
