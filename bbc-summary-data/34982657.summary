Dartmouth man admits killing at former church building

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted killing another man who was found fatally injured at a former church building in Devon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dean Rosser, 48, from Jubilee Close, Dartmouth, had denied the murder of Colin Edwards.
However, Mr Rosser pleaded guilty to his manslaughter at Bristol Crown Court on Tuesday.
The 49-year-old victim was found at the Dartmouth Apprentice site in August where he was treated by paramedics, but later died.
The 1830s St Barnabas Church building is now a supported living project.
The date for the sentencing of Rosser is yet to be fixed.
