Her BMW was spotted by police on the M1 northbound in Northamptonshire, near the Watford Gap services on Sunday.
"Just found a car parked in lane three of the M1, waiting for her husband to be sick in the roadworks," officers wrote on Twitter.
The woman was "given advice" by police who issued a warning to other motorists to "never stop in live lanes".

East Midlands officers were alerted after receiving reports of a "pedestrian in the roadworks".
"When we got to the scene we found a woman was parked in lane three of the carriageway and her husband had got out as he was feeling unwell," a spokesman said.
She had stopped in an area where there are roadworks and no hard shoulder, but police warned "motorists must wherever possible pull in to an area of safety and should not just stop in the carriageway as clearly that could cause an accident or tailbacks".
The woman was told to drive the five miles (8km) to the services and her husband was transported there in a police vehicle.
