Team Scotland won 10 medals, including four golds, to claim third place in the medal table.
England leads the table with six golds out of 17 medals on day one, with Australia second.
Much of the Scottish success came in judo, with six medal winners, including golds for sisters Kimberley and Louise Renicks.
Sisters Kimberley and Louise Renicks won Scotland's first gold medals with victories before a raucous home crowd.
Kimberley, 26, secured her country's first gold, beating India's Sushila Likmabam courtesy of an ippon in the 48kg weight category.
The Lanarkshire native's crowning move sparked jubilant scenes at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC).
Louise, 31, overcame England's Kelly Edwards in a nervy 52kg final.
There was more medal success for Scotland in the judo hall with Stephanie Inglis taking silver in the under 57kg category while Glasgow fighter Connie Ramsay secured bronze.
John Buchanan won bronze in the men's under 60kg category while James Millar took bronze in the under 66kg competition.
In one of the shocks of the Games so far, Ross Murdoch broke the Commonwealth Games record as he easily beat fellow Scot Michael Jamieson to claim gold in the men's 200m breaststroke final.
Murdoch finished nearly a second ahead of Jamieson - the poster boy of Glasgow 2014 - in two minutes 7.30 seconds, with England's Andrew Willis third.
A thrilled Murdoch, 20, said: "There's no way that just happened. I can't believe it. That was amazing.
"I didn't think I could do that if I'm honest. I'm so surprised."
Hannah Miley won the gold medal ahead of England's Aimee Willmott in the women's 400m individual medley.
Scotland's first medal of the games went to Aileen McGlynn and pilot Louise Haston who won silver in para-cycling.
The pair came second in the women's sprint B2 tandem at the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome.
The race was won by Sophie Thornhill and pilot Helen Scott, who picked up England's first Commonwealth Games track gold after beating the Scottish pair 2-0 in a best-of-three final.
English success started with Triathlete Jodie Stimpson, who won the first gold medal of the Games to banish the pain of missing out on the London Olympics.
Stimpson sprinted to victory at Strathclyde Country Park while team-mate Vicky Holland took a surprise bronze behind Canada's Kirsten Sweetland.
Stimpson went into the race as the top-ranked competitor and justified that position with a commanding performance, pulling away from Sweetland over the closing 500 metres.
Alistair Brownlee added Commonwealth triathlon gold to his Olympic, world and European titles to complete the full set and make it a perfect opening day for England.
Brownlee ran away from a splintered field as younger brother Jonny took silver and South Africa's Richard Murray bronze.
Stewart Harris, chief executive of sportscotland, said: "Congratulations to all Team Scotland athletes who gave their all for their country today, and what an outstanding achievement it is to win 10 medals on the opening day.
"Four gold, three silver, and four bronze medals has exceeded all expectations. Spurred on by an incredible home crowd, Team Scotland is on track to deliver its best ever medal haul at a Commonwealth Games.
"This is a historic and proud day for Team Scotland."
In total, about 4,500 athletes from 71 nations are taking part in the Games, which run until 3 August.
