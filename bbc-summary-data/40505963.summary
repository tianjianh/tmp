Chantelle Connelly, 27, has lost her income endorsing products on Instagram since the attack, Newcastle Magistrates' Court heard.
She had denied the assault but was convicted of grievous bodily harm after a trial.
She was also given a 12-month community order and 200 hours of unpaid work.
The court heard how Connelly had been dumped by many businesses since the attack, her TV work had dried up and she had lost a lot of her income.
John Wesencraft, defending, said: "There is going to be quite a catastrophic effect on Miss Connelly's income.
"Prior to these proceedings, her income was fairly substantial - it has roughly halved.
"She has largely been dropped by the people who were putting work in her direction."
He said her outgoings exceeded her income and she was "under pressure" from her bank.
The court heard how Connelly and the woman were introduced in the VIP area of Bijoux bar and were part of a larger group.
But the mood changed when they moved to a different bar and Connelly became jealous about an ex-boyfriend and repeatedly asked her victim if she had "been with him".
Holly Common, prosecuting, said the victim felt intimidated and was later attacked by Connelly outside Powerhouse nightclub.
She suffered a cut to the mouth, which needed stitches, and fractured her wrist when she fell.
Connelly was also ordered to pay Â£620 court costs and Â£85 surcharge.
She has always insisted she was nowhere near the victim and it was a case of mistaken identity.
