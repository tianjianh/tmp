Former Derry City striker Kevin McHugh's season looks to be over after a freak accident almost completely sliced off his finger.

The Finn Harps captain was hosting a coaching session in County Donegal when his wedding ring got caught in a fence.
The 36-year-old immediately drove himself to Letterkenny University Hospital to try and save the finger.
He was then taken by ambulance to Galway University Hospital to undergo surgery on Thursday morning.
Mr McHugh said he had been chasing after a stray football when the accident happened.
He then tweeted a graphic picture of his injury with the caption: "Think that's my season over."
Mr McHugh added that he may have suffered "too much damage" to save his finger.
The footballer, who once had a trial with Aston Villa, played for the Candystripes from 2006 to 2008 before returning to his native Finn Harps via Linfield.
Finn Harps are third from bottom in the League of Ireland Premier Division table after they dug out a scoreless draw with Sligo Rovers on Tuesday.
