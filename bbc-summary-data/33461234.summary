Sir Peter Fahy: Greater Manchester Police's chief constable to retire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, has said he will retire later this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 56-year-old was counter-terrorism lead for the Association of Chief Police Officers and continues in a similar role for its successor body, the National Police Chiefs' Council.
Sir Peter, a policeman since 1981, has been Greater Manchester's chief constable for seven years.
He will become chief executive of the children's charity Retrak.
Sir Peter said it had been "a great privilege to serve the people of Greater Manchester and to lead the wonderfully dedicated staff of Greater Manchester Police (GMP)".
"It has always been my intention to leave during the autumn of this year," he said.
"I have led the force through four years of budget cuts and staffing reductions but despite this we have achieved significant improvements in service, increased public confidence and reduced crime and anti-social behaviour.
"It is now time for someone else to bring fresh ideas for what will be more challenging years ahead."
Sir Peter was appointed chief constable of GMP - one of the largest police forces in the UK - in 2008 and is paid a Â£193,000 annual salary.
His time in office included the 2012 murders of policewomen Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone by Dale Cregan, and the mass poisoning of patients at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport by nurse Victorino Chua.
In his role as chief constable, he faced a health and safety charge after one of his officers shot dead an unarmed suspect, Anthony Grainger, in 2012.
However Sir Peter, who denied the charge, was not prosecuted after the case was dropped earlier this year.
Greater Manchester's interim mayor Tony Lloyd, who is also the region's police and crime commissioner, said Sir Peter was "held in the highest regard" locally and nationally.
"He has been a great credit to both GMP and Greater Manchester and he leaves us in much better shape than when he arrived."
Sir Peter, who grew up in London, previously worked in Hertfordshire and West Midlands.
He was assistant chief constable in Surrey before becoming chief constable in Cheshire in 2002.
Regarding his new role, he said he had volunteered with African street children charity Retrak for the past five years with GMP colleagues.
"It fits in well with my interest in child protection and child welfare issues in this country. I am very excited by this new challenge," he added.
