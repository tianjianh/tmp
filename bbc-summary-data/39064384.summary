The beach at Rosemarkie in the Highlands was closed to the public on Tuesday following the discovery.
A Royal Navy bomb disposal team from HM Clyde at Faslane disposed of the device, thought to be from World War Two, on Wednesday evening.
Lt Cmdr Tony Hampshire said the coastguard had told the team children had been playing with the device.
The Royal Navy officer said: "Despite its era the explosive was probably intact and still dangerous. These devices should be treated with respect.
"The family who realised the danger did absolutely the right thing."
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: "Thankfully the children who were reported playing with this live mortar were unharmed.
"Thanks to Inverness Coastguard and Nairn Coastguard for making Rosemarkie Beach safe for the public until the Royal Navy's EOD team arrived to safely dispose of this device."
