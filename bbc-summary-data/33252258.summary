[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have been jailed for at least 28 years for murdering a Wrexham man with a crossbow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sion Davies, 25, died after being shot with the weapon and falling from a third floor balcony at a flat at Caia Park in October, 2014.
Lee Roberts, 33, and Anthony Munkley, known as Charlie, 53, were jailed for life at Mold Crown Court on Thursday.
The judge, Mr Justice Wyn Williams, said it was a punishment murder over a drugs debt.
Munkley was given a concurrent eight-year sentence for drugs offences and Roberts got four years.
Munkley's wife, Gwenythe, 55, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice after helping her husband to evade arrest.
Her sentencing was adjourned for pre-sentence reports and she was bailed.
All three defendants were also found guilty of conspiring to supply drugs, although Munkley admitted being concerned in the supply of cannabis.
Evidence from Mr Davies's mobile phone was used to convict the men, which had recorded footage of the attack on it.
It proved Munkley was at the flat and had not disappeared as he had claimed when a "mystery Geordie man" carried out the murder.
The court heard Mr Davies suffered "horrific" injuries in the attack and subsequent fall.
A statement from Mr Davies's family said: "We are still completely devastated at the loss of Sion and still can't believe this is real.
"Regardless of the circumstances of his death, Sion was a caring, loving son, brother and partner and we are lost without him."
