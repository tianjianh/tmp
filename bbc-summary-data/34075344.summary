Here is a snapshot of 63 of your memories, one for each year of her reign.

3. I met the Queen in 1999 in Portsmouth for an Easter parade. I gave her the biggest egg and she asked me if there were any jewels inside. I just shook my head not really knowing what to say! Natasha Standley, Portsmouth, England
4.
5. I was four, I still remember having to practise curtsying before giving her some flowers. Jessica Mullett, Plymouth, England

12. I was in Pennsylvania to see the Liberty Bell. A man in a suit with an ear phone walked up to me and requested I leave as the Queen was going to view the bell. I was shocked and preceded down to the corner of the road. At this point a limousine stopped where I was standing as the Queen was right next to me. Robert Eldridge, Florida, US

24. I met her as a Girl Guide. She asked "How many badges have you got?" I was completely flustered and answered "Lots! I have lots more at home too!" It was the worst answer in history. Erin Jackson, Dumfries, Scotland
25.
26. On returning to the US after a trip to England, the passport officer asked if I had met the Queen. When I said yes, he was astonished. He told me he asked everyone who went through his line after a trip to the UK and I was the first to say yes.  Carol Williamson, Pennsylvania, US

34. The smile she gave me was that of a grandma who hadn't seen her grandchild for 20 years. It lit up the room says Dr Julia Malkin from Leicester on receiving her MBE in 2011.
35. I met the Queen when I was an acting student. After the performance she asked me how long the play was going to run, I spluttered out "Two years... I mean months... weeks!" She looked at me as if I were completely deranged, smiled and passed graciously on. Hayward Morse, England and Canada

38. We all got a big smile from the Queen when she visited Maltby Comprehensive School in 1977 during the Silver Jubilee tour. Barry Porteus, Doncaster, England
39. Can you lie to a Queen? Paul Harman from St Albans faced that dilemma: "The Queen asked me if the rose I had given her came from my garden. It hadn't - someone in the crowd had given it to me to pass to her. Can I lie to the Queen and say yes? Because otherwise I'd have to admit I hadn't brought anything to give her!"
