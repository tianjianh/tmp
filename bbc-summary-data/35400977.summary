Carswell will continue in her role as women's cricket manager at Cricket Scotland.
"Every coach knows when it's time to find a new challenge," said Carswell.
"It's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride and we've had some amazing results. Off the field we've made great strides in the support we can now provide our best female cricketers."
Carswell intends to focus her efforts on development pathways and progressing the sport in Scotland.
"Kari has done an outstanding job over a considerable amount of time and the standard of cricket the girls are now playing is a credit to the players, their head coach and all the support team who are now involved in the programme," added Andy Tennant, Cricket Scotland performance director.
"We are also excited about the opportunity this presents Kari to take more of a strategic role in leading the further development of the women's game in Scotland."
Scotland just failed to qualify for this year's ICC Women's World Twenty20, losing to Ireland in the semi-finals of last month's qualifiers.
