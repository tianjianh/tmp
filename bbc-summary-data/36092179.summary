Burlesque barber shop in Bawtry overturns under-18s ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A barber shop given permission to serve alcohol and host burlesque nights has overturned a ban on letting under-18s in to the premises.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gentleman's Retreat was granted the licence on the condition no children would be allowed on site.
Owner James Herrington said the strict terms meant some staff and his young daughter would not be able to enter.
The ban was relaxed on condition certain areas remain off-limits to under-18s.

Mr Herrington's licence, granted by Doncaster Council, permits him to operate a barbers, tattoo parlour and bar, along with events including burlesque nights and poker games.
He said he believed some of the objections were fuelled by "rumours and word of mouth rather than the truth".
Despite the conditions, Pastor Simon Carter from the Bawtry Evangelical Free Church said he feared there would be "overlap" between the activities.
"The whole tone of the building would just not be suitable for children to be involved in.
"I think this sort of business and mixing the two things in the same venue is not going to help in any way shape or form."
