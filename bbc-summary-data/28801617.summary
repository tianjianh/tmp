The body of the US DJ, Casey Kasem, is to be moved to Oslo, according to reports in the Norwegian newspaper VG.

A government official told the paper an application had been made to bury Kasem's remains in the city.
His body was moved by his wife, Jean, to Montreal in Canada after he died, aged 82, in the US state of Washington in June.
Kasem's children from a previous marriage say his remains are being kept from them by their stepmother.
The DJ's wife and children have been in dispute over his body since his death.
Kasem's daughter, Kerri, has accused Mrs Kasem of abusing her father before he died.
Kerri Kasem wants a full autopsy to be performed on the body.
The abuse allegations are being investigated by police in Santa Monica, where Kasem had been in hospital before his death.
Kerri Kasem's spokesman, Danny Deraney, told Billboard it was not clear what Jean Kasem planned to do with her husband's remains.
"We just know that she wants to keep Casey away from family and friends and by the looks of it, [is] hiding from law enforcement," he said.
If Kasem is finally laid to rest in Norway, it will be the end of a journey for the man who was the voice of Shaggy in the TV animation, Scooby Doo.
In May, Kasem - who had been suffering from dementia - was taken by his wife from Santa Monica to Las Vegas and then to Washington state, where they were tracked down by a private investigator working for Kasem's children.
After Kasem's death his body was then moved to Montreal, despite a court order designed to prevent his remains being removed from a funeral home in Tacoma.
Now it appears Oslo may be the DJ's final stop.
But Kasem's son, Mike, said his father had no connection to Norway.
"I don't know if Jean has any ties to Oslo. She certainly has never mentioned it in the last 35 years," he told Billboard.
"Everyone keeps asking for motives as to why Jean acts how she acts. I don't have an answer."
Kasem began his career in the 1950s and found fame with the chart programme.
He famously ended his broadcasts with his signature sign-off: "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars."
