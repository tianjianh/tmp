[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A joint inspection of the delivery of services for older people in the Western Isles has identified the need for improvement.

The Care Inspectorate and Healthcare Improvement Scotland looked at services provided by NHS Western Isles and local authority Comhairle nan Eilean Siar.
The watchdogs said there were "weaknesses" and "crucial areas for improvement" in the services.
They acknowledged that care provision was "performing well in some aspects".
The comhairle and health board provide the services as a partnership.
A new report on the inspection carried out in April and June last year includes 12 recommendations for improvements.
The inspectors said in the report that too many older people were subject to delayed discharge from hospital, and were having to wait too long for care-at-home support or a care home placement.
They also identified "very limited" development of intermediate care services and said there was a need for "timely diagnosis" of dementia.
Inspectors also flagged up where the health board and council have been working well.
Front line health and social work staff were "well motivated and worked well together", said the report.
There was also a "strong sense of community spirit" among staff and patients.
Karen Reid, chief executive of the Care Inspectorate, said: "This report has highlighted important weaknesses in services provided for older people across the Western Isles, and we have clearly laid out our recommendations as to how these should be addressed.
"In particular, effective and consistent leadership is needed to ensure that services deliver better outcomes for older people who access them, and for their families and carers.
"We require significant improvement to ensure high-quality care is provided to older people in a way which reflects their needs and promotes their rights.
"The Care Inspectorate will now work with Healthcare Improvement Scotland and the Scottish government's chief social work adviser to directly support improvement in the partnership."
Robbie Pearson, acting chief executive of Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said: "In this joint inspection we found that most of the older people and carers that we met were generally happy with the services provided to them in the Western Isles.
"They felt that the services contributed to better outcomes in respect of their health and wellbeing. We also saw good examples of older people being supported to remain in their own homes.
"However, we found a number of important weaknesses that need to be addressed. A significant proportion of older people were subject to delayed discharges from hospital - this issue was raised in a previous inspection for the care of older people by Healthcare Improvement Scotland."
He added: "We are confident that the recommendations set out in this report will result in significant improvements in the care that older people receive."
