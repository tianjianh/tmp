A series of events will be held as part of a review into Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board.
The board was placed in special measures after the report into the Tawel Fan ward at Denbighshire's Glan Clwyd Hospital was published in 2013.
Author Donna Ockenden said she wanted to hear patients' voices.
The review is part of an ongoing assessment into the way the health board manages older people's mental health services across north Wales.
"Reaching out to patients and health care staff in this way is crucial to my review establishing  the truth," said Ms Ockenden.
"Listening to staff, patients, carers and patient families will help my team ensure that patients' voices are a central part of my final report."
The meetings in April, May and in June will also be open to NHS staff, carers and patients themselves.
Ms Ockenden's team will also be joined by the North Wales Community Health Council, the independent body that represents patients views to the health board.
"Our teams will be available on a series of dates - morning, noon and evening - so that people can come and talk to us - in confidence if they want - about their experiences, whether they be good or bad," said the watchdog's chairwoman, Jackie Allen.
Final details of the meetings venues and times will be confirmed in the coming weeks.
