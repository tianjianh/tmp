The 20-year-old Wales international was hurt in the dying moments of Ospreys 23-13 win over Exeter on 15 November.
"To ensure the best result for Daf the decision was for him to have surgery to repair a damaged tendon," said Ospreys official Chris Towers.
"He will have a slow recovery period and is looking at four to five months before he'll be able to play again."
