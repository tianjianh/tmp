Stevenage 3-3 Newport County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County started the League Two season where they ended the last, by producing a great escape.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles scored twice in the final 15 minutes from 3-1 down, with sub Shawn McCoulsky equalising in injury time.
The hosts held the advantage when Tom Pett scored, but Frank Nouble levelled.
Dale Gorman's penalty and a goal from Danny Newton put Stevenage in charge, but Mickey Demetriou gave the Exiles late hope with a 25-yard strike before McCoulsky's dramatic leveller.
Stevenage manager Darren Sarll:
"The manner of the goals showcased how important set plays are in this division.
"We haven't conceded a goal by being broken down. We conceded an absolute worldy [world class] of a strike and the other two goals were from set plays.
"The players have to know that there are a few long afternoon training sessions ahead of them now to try and improve us on that."
Newport County manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport:
"That was two points dropped if I'm honest. I thought we were the better team, created more chances and gave them two goals. All in all I am disappointed.
"The boys just showed their character again, they kept going until the end and they're going to have to do that quite a lot this season and you'll be surprised where that takes you.
"They've all got great team spirit, they keep going and if one thing goes against them they try and make it right."
