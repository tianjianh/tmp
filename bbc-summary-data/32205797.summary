The gang tried to force open a cash machine outside a Waitrose in Kenilworth with an angle grinder, circular saw, crowbars and a hydraulic cutter.
They sped off empty handed, taking police from three forces on a high-speed pursuit during their getaway.
The men were jailed from three to 12 years at Birmingham Crown Court.
They were detained in Mile Oak, Tamworth on 29 September after a pursuit involving officers from Warwickshire, West Midlands and Staffordshire, and a police helicopter.
West Midlands Police said the gang hacked at the cash machine with the equipment.
"Sparks flew as they used an angle grinder to slice open the machine frontage but despite concerted efforts they were unable to breach its cash defences," a police spokesman said.
Residents at homes overlooking the Bertie Road shop were woken by the noise at 03:20 BST.
Police said unmarked traffic cars followed the gang on the M42 where "racetrack-like speeds" were reached in a stolen Audi RS7.
But they were monitored by a police helicopter, which directed officers to flats in Mile Oak.
Pedro Taylor, 30, of no fixed abode, and 27-year-old Jason Hadley of Harcourt Road, Birmingham, were each sentenced to three years in prison for conspiracy to steal over the botched raid.
Two of the men were also sentenced for their part in a separate plot to rob a jeweller thought to be carrying thousands of pounds of diamonds.  Mark Kirk, 34, of Cadbury Drive, Castle Vale, Birmingham, was jailed for 11 years, six months while Dean Beech, 37, of Courtney Road, Great Barr, was jailed for 12 years.
They were convicted of conspiracy to steal, conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking in February. They were sentenced with Darren Bowman, 47, of Kingswood Road, Moseley, Birmingham.
Bowman, accused of planning the diamond robbery, was sentenced to six years, two months.
