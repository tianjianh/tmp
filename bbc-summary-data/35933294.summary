Liam Bridcutt tackle: 'That's Scottish football', says Erik Sviatchenko

Celtic defender Erik Sviatchenko was not surprised by the ferocity of Liam Bridcutt's Hampden tackle as he views it as typical of Scottish football.

The challenge from the midfielder in Scotland's 1-0 win was criticised by Denmark coach Age Hareide.
"I am still standing," said Sviatchenko. "I am okay. My knee is still there.
"That's Scottish football, I am getting used to it. I am all right, but it was a harsh tackle."
Sviatchenko arrived in Scotland in January when Celtic signed him from Danish club Midtjylland.
Hareide thought the challenge from Bridcutt, who is on loan to Leeds United from Sunderland, could have ended the 24-year-old's career.
Bridcutt, who was earning his second Scotland cap as a second-half substitute, only received a yellow card from Norwegian referee Svein Oddvar Moen.
"The referee said it was a friendly game and for him it was a difficult call," Sviatchenko said.
"It was on the verge for a red card, but I'm not going to judge anything."
Sviatchenko's Celtic team-mate, Scott Brown, the Scotland captain, was quick to protect Bridcutt as the Danish players rounded on him and later described it as "a fair tackle".
"I think if he sees it again, he will probably say it's a fair tackle again," said the Denmark defender.
"But Broony is a funny guy and, when he plays, he plays with his heart and he wants to win every ball.
"I'm not injured, so he can say that."
