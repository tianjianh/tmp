Flybe's new programme will also include more weekly flights to Geneva for the winter 2016/17 ski season.
The service to Paris Charles de Gaulle will also operate earlier flight times to allow families longer day-trips to Disneyland Paris.
Transport Minister Edwina Hart said the announcement was "great news" for Welsh passengers.
The Welsh government bought the airport for Â£52m in March 2013 amid concerns about investment by its then Spanish owners.
The airport in Rhoose, Vale of Glamorgan saw 1.2 million passengers come through its doors in the past 12 months as February's figure increased by 68% on the previous year.
Flybe will start flying to Berlin Tegel twice a week on a Wednesday and Saturday from 2 November 2016.
The Glasgow route will increase to 11 flights per week, while the Geneva route will move to three times per week.
Debra Barber, Cardiff Airport's managing director, said: "It is fantastic to see the airline responding to the demands of the Welsh market by adding additional capacity and another new route to its network."
Mrs Hart added: "The addition of this new Flybe route to Berlin is great news for Welsh passengers and the tourism industry and a sign of growing confidence in Cardiff Airport."
Further flights for next winter are due to be released in the coming weeks.
