The 16-year-old male was with a group swimming in the pool beneath High Force in Middleton-in-Teesdale on Tuesday.
He was recovered from the water by a fire brigade rescue boat and airlifted to Middlesbrough's James Cook Hospital, but later died.
Police said five other teenagers, three boys and two girls, who had been with the boy, were not injured.
High Force, where the River Tees plunges 65ft, is one of County Durham's most popular tourist destinations.
Police, fire crews, air support, and a mountain rescue volunteers carried out a search of the area after the alarm was raised at about 20:00 BST.
The teenager was located some time later, and was treated at the scene by paramedics.
Pete Bell, from Teesdale and Weardale Mountain Rescue Team, said: "Unfortunately these bodies of water are magnets for people when the weather is good, but despite the air temperature being warm the water is still cold and there are unknown currents. Even the best swimmers can find themselves in difficulty.
"We would urge people not to go into the water at High Force because the risks are considerable."
