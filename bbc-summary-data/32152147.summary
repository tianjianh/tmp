It is the first time South Yorkshire has played host to the service, which recognises the work of elderly people to their community and church.
This year, 89 women and 89 men - one for each of the Queen's 89 years - received the Maundy money.
The Dean of Sheffield, the Very Reverend Peter Bradley, said it was a historic moment for South Yorkshire.
"We are deeply honoured to be chosen to host the Royal Maundy Service on behalf of our nation," he said.
"This service is a special opportunity to recognise individuals who have worked to make a positive contribution to the community."
The monarch's Maundy Thursday service has been held in England since the 12th Century, to mark Jesus washing his disciples' feet.
During the service the Queen distributed specially-minted money to the men and women, all from the Sheffield area.
The recipients were given two leather pouches, one of which contained Maundy coins equating in pence to the Queen's age.
Simon Green, an executive director of Sheffield City Council said: "It's a priceless event for Sheffield. It's a positive endorsement of the city."
He said the estimated cost for the council of the event was Â£30,000 but it had "brought 12,000 people to the city".
