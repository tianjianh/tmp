[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was jailed for 12 years over an international drug trafficking operation is to have more cash seized under proceeds of crime laws.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sohaib Qureshi from Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, is thought to have made £1.2m from trafficking cocaine from Colombia and the Caribbean to Scotland.
He was jailed in March 2012 after being caught along with two other men.
Qureshi originally had £70,000 seized. A judge has now granted a confiscation order for a further £91.000.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, advocate depute Barry Divers said that an application was being made to change the confiscation order previously made against Qureshi.
He said the new order would confiscate pounds £161,000 from the 40-year-old, who had already paid £70,000 towards the figure.
Laura Reilly, counsel for Qureshi, told the judge, Lord Kinclaven, an agreement had been reached in the action after negotiations between the Crown and defence.
The businessman, who was once described as a millionaire property owner, denied the charges against him but was convicted following a trial at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The court heard how officers from the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) targeted the drug smuggling operation which sourced high-purity cocaine in Colombia and the Dominican Republic.
As part of Operation Klaxon, undercover officers carried out surveillance on a house in Springburn, Glasgow, in April 2009.
Qureshi was seen at the house, along with Ronald Augustine, from the city's Maryhill area and David Byrne, from Springboig, Glasgow.
When officers later stopped Qureshi and Byrne in a car, they found scales and other items used to cut and distribute drugs.
A raid was then carried out at the house in Springburn, where officers found 4.5 kilos of cocaine with a possible street value of £180,000 together with 5.5 kilos of benzococaine, which could be used to bulk out the drug.
Qureshi was later jailed for 12 years, with Augustine sentenced to seven years for providing a "safe house" for the cocaine operation and courier Byrne jailed for two-and-a-half years.
Two men were also jailed in the Caribbean and two Colombians were arrested in the country's capital Bogota after police were tipped off by their counterparts in Scotland.
