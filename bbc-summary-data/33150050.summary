[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twenty-seven people believed to be migrants have been found in the back of a lorry on the A1 in Cambridgeshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police stopped the vehicle between Wittering and Stamford and the lorry driver was arrested on suspicion of facilitating immigration.
Police said 27 people with a variety of nationalities were detained.
Five were taken to hospital suffering from dehydration and the others were assessed at the scene, the ambulance service said.
Three ambulances, four ambulance officers and a hazardous area response team were sent to the Great North Road north of Peterborough at 11:55 BST.
Kevin Monaghan, who was driving on the A1 at the time the lorry was stopped, said he saw "undercover police cars and normal police cars" at the scene.
"You could see a lot of people lined up at the barrier on the central reservation. I guess they'd been in the lorry."
Cambridgeshire Police said Hertfordshire Police first alerted them to a lorry with a French registration carrying "about 30 possible immigrants... travelling north on the M11".
It then continued on to the A1 before being stopped.
No further details are known about the people inside the lorry.
The vehicle was escorted to the Haddon Services area off junction 17 of the A1, police said.
