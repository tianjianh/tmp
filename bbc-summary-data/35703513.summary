The Fire Service is treating the blaze as accidental.
Michael Bradley, who produced the Gerry Anderson Show, said it was a "very sad day".
"I remember Geordie coming in to an outside broadcast and it was like Elvis entering the building."
"Gerry Anderson and Sean Coyle always knew what made him tick," he added.
"Callers to the programme would sometimes pretend to be colourful characters. Geordie was one of a kind though.
"A lot of people will be thinking about him today and listening back to clips of him."
Crews were called to Mr Tuft's home on the Legannany Road on Tuesday afternoon.
