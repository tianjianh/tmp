Two footballers have apologised after they were both photographed apparently urinating into a glass at Cheltenham Festival.

MK Dons midfielder Samir Carruthers and Northampton Town's on-loan striker James Collins appeared to relieve themselves on a racecourse balcony.
Collins said it "emphasised the negative stereotype of the modern footballer".
Carruthers told Sky Sports News "I've let everyone down.
"I'm meant to be a role model and I have to live by my actions now.
"I've let the community down and I've let Milton Keynes down and I have to take the criticism that comes with it.
"It was a silly mistake."
He added he had been disciplined by the club following a meeting with chairman Pete Winkelman and manager Karl Robinson.
The player has been suspended by the club and fined two weeks' wages.
Mr Winkleman said: "He has also taken full responsibility for his behaviour and understands the damage he has caused to his own and the Club's reputation."
The incident on Tuesday led to a group being banned from the second day of racing. It is not known whether the same group was due to attend.
Collins, who was also photographed pouring the glass of urine over the balcony, is currently on loan from Shrewsbury Town.
Both clubs said he had been fined two weeks' wages.
In a statement released on both club's websites, he said: "I have completely let myself, my family, the fans, and the two clubs that I represent down and I am sorry to everyone involved.
"This has only emphasised the negative stereotype of the modern footballer and for that I am truly sorry and disappointed in myself.
"It is now something that I will work hard to change."
Cobblers chairman Kelvin Thomas said Collins' actions had "damaged the reputation of the two clubs and football in general".
Shrewsbury Town chief executive Brian Caldwell echoed the comments and said he was "extremely disappointed".
Bristol City player Luke Ayling, pictured laughing with the pair, has not commented but the club said it was investigating.

Cheltenham director Ian Renton said the incident was "totally out of place on this racecourse".
The four-day Cheltenham Festival is one of the highlights of the horse racing season, with the Queen's granddaughter Zara Tindall and the Countess of Wessex among the guests at this year's event.
Gloucestershire Police said it was made aware of the "disgusting and thoughtless act" and no police action would be taken.
The balcony was over a lawn and not easily visible, it added.
