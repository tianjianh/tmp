Harper, 38, was released by the Magpies at the end of last season, having spent 20 years with the club.
A tweet from Hull's official Twitter feed read: "We are delighted to announce the signing of Steve Harper on a one-year deal."
Harper will provide competition for Scottish keeper Allan McGregor, who has joined from Besiktas.
Harper spent much of his Newcastle career as back-up for Shay Given although he played in Newcastle's FA Cup final defeat to Manchester United in 1999 and has Champions League experience.
His final game for Newcastle was a 1-0 Premier League defeat to Arsenal in May.
