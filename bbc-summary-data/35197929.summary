About 5,500 homes and businesses remain without power on Wednesday evening.
The places worst affected by the storm are Wicklow, New Ross, Athlone, and Inistioge in County Kilkenny, according to Irish state broadcaster, RT??.
In Midleton, County Cork, the Irish Army helped to evacuate about 12 family homes after a river overflowed. Several people were also rescued from cars.
They included a woman and two children who were rescued from a car in Glanmire, County Cork.
The main road from Cork to Kerry, the N20, remains badly flooded in places.
The storm also led to rail service disruption in some areas, especially around Cork, where passengers were bussed between Tralee and Killarney and Mallow due to subsidence along the rail track.
Some sailings by Stena Line and Irish Ferries have been cancelled but sailings of P&O Ferries are running to schedule.
Environment Minister Alan Kelly and Office of Public Works Minister Simon Harris visited Athlone on Wednesday afternoon, where Storm Frank has caused extensive flooding, adding to the problems caused by Storms Desmond and Eva.
Mr Harris said Irish Prime Minister (Taoiseach) Enda Kenny would be visiting more places affected by the flooding in the coming days and the flooding issue would be first on the agenda at Tuesday's cabinet meeting.
