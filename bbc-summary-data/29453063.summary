Friends from Northampton explain why they 'pre-load'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is an "epidemic" among young people who are drinking cheap alcohol at home before going out, then carrying on and ending up in hospital, according to the UK's top A&E doctor. Newsbeat's Dan Whitworth spent a Friday night out with five Newsbeat listeners in Northampton to find out more about "pre-loading".

OK. So it's 7:30pm and I'm driving down a dark country lane about five miles west of Northampton.
Looking for my contact's house I'm squinting through the dark looking for the driveway.

Think I see it. Spot it. Drive past it.
Quick U-turn and I'm there and a warm welcome's waiting inside.
The first person I meet is 22-year-old Andreas Nichola, the second person is his mum - Mrs Nichola.
"Help yourself to some food, would you like a drink?" is not the average welcome I get on a story, but after three hours driving there it's a very nice one.
It's not long before Andreas's mum and dad leave for the night and his mates, Lewis Foster, Ben Beesley, Greg Walding and Matt Golloway, all 22, turn up.
Two cases of beer are in the fridge along with a bottle of wine that the guys have bought - and snacks seem to be everywhere, so chalk one up for Mrs Nichola.
The group is quick to get on the drinks and it's not long before the chat is flowing, the music is playing and the alcohol is vanishing fast.
Lewis said: "It's a lot cheaper to do than [just] going down the pub.
"You save a lot more money this way and it means we can get together a lot more often whereas if we were going down the pub all the time we could do it once a month, this way we can do it once a week".
Matt said: "I think for us guys, some of us work away in the week, I mean we've been friends for years so it's just a nice opportunity just to all catch up before we go out."
Andreas said: "It's just easier. We all live in the same area so if we meet up here, all share a cab it just brings down costs completely and as long as you're sensible about it there's no worries".
Speaking of cabs they are getting through their beers and wine, it's 10pm and time to book one.

Cue a big eight-seater and the 10-minute ride into Northampton town centre.
So this is where it gets fun.
The guys have got through the best part of a couple of cases of beer and a bottle of wine and the night is looking good.
Hit the pub and it goes from busy to quiet to busy in the space of what feels like a few minutes.
They've bumped into a load of their friends but - crucially - because they're already stocked up on cheap, supermarket booze, they're not spending a fortune at the bar.
Another couple of interviews and the same can't be said of me (I'm sticking to soft drinks).
"You sure you won't stay for one? We're going onto another bar, come out, it'll be quality."
I have one drink but I make my excuses and thank Andreas and his mates for letting me intrude on their night.
I check out the bar billâ€¦ think I should maybe have bought some cheaper drinks before I came out.
