Resuming her rain-delayed match from Tuesday, Konta recovered from an early break to beat Monica Puig 6-1 7-5.
On a cold and windy day, the Puerto Rican world number 36 broke to take a 4-2 lead in the second set, but 16th seed Konta finished brilliantly.
The 25-year-old told BBC Sport: "It was definitely a tricky first match. The conditions didn't make it easy for us."
Konta, the world number 19, will play Canadian Eugenie Bouchard after the former finalist beat Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova 6-3 6-4.
"There were obstacles in both our ways and I'm happy I was able to stay focused," added Konta, who has suffered four first-round losses at Wimbledon.
"I do my best to keep myself present, not rush anywhere and enjoy being out there, enjoy the atmosphere.
"I'm happy with how I'm able to serve and return. It's just about staying offensive and really looking to dictate out there."
Britons Heather Watson and Dan Evans were unable to complete their matches because of the weather.
Watson will resume her match with Annika Beck in the third set, with the German having levelled the match by winning the second. Evans and 30th seed Alexandr Dolgopolov were 6-6 in the first before play was suspended.
