US actor James Franco will not be making his Broadway debut in Tennessee Williams' Sweet Bird of Youth this autumn, his publicist has confirmed.

The 127 Hours star had been set to appear opposite Nicole Kidman in the play, which tells of an ageing actress and the gigolo who exploits her.
Franco's publicist did not state why the 33-year-old was no longer involved.
The actor is currently filming Oz: The Great and Powerful and studying for a doctorate in English at Yale.
Franco, currently on screen in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, will also soon be seen in long-running US soap General Hospital.
The actor, who co-hosted the Oscars earlier this year, has a number of films in various stages of production.
Sweet Bird of Youth had been one of most anticipated plays this season because of Franco and Kidman's involvement.
In an interview with the New York Times, however, director David Cromer said the revival would now not happen this autumn.
The original Broadway production of Sweet Bird of Youth opened in March 1959 starring Geraldine Page and Paul Newman.
The play, which ran for 10 months and was nominated for several Tony awards, was later made into a film with the two actors reprising their Broadway roles.
