'Selfie' of Brunel looking fed-up on a train, goes on show in Bristol

A "selfie" of Isambard Kingdom Brunel as he shivered on a rattling train in 1836, is to go on show.

The self-portrait was drawn as he travelled on an "ice chiller" train on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.
Matthew Tanner, of the ss Great Britain Trust, said the picture - on show in Bristol - "is the first selfie really".
A number of Brunel's previously unseen notebooks are on show at the ss Great Britain to mark the 175th anniversary of his first London-to-Bristol train.
The previously unseen pencil drawing, was drawn years before Brunel was appointed as chief engineer for the Great Western Railway Company.
It shows a man shivering in a cold carriage, with his hands in his pockets trying to keep warm with the comment: "Travelling in an ice chiller - hands very cold, going 28 miles per hour on the Lion locomotive".
Mr Tanner said the young Victorian engineer would travel the nation's bumpy railway lines with a notebook in his back pocket trying to draw and write smoothly.
"He went on everybody else's railway to see how bad they were," he said.
"And he tried to draw perfect circles as he was travelling along, as his measure of the smoothness of the railway."
Two years later, he was appointed chief engineer for "God's Wonderful Railway", the length of which he personally surveyed in its entirety in a bid to find the smoothest, flattest route.
Matthew Golton, GWR commercial director, said: "The diary extract could well be documentary evidence of the moment of inspiration that gave birth to Brunel's vision of the Great Western Railway.
"The second - likely a self-portrait - bears an uncanny resemblance to one of the famous photographs by the landing chains of the ss Great Eastern, almost 30 years later."
Brunel's diary entries and notebooks are on display at Brunel's ss Great Britain until 2 July.
