Potential titles of new Spider-Man film revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sony Pictures appears to be considering at least four different titles for its forthcoming Spider-Man reboot.

Spider-Man: Coming of Age, Spider-Man: Greatness Awaits, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Suspended.
Late last week the film studio registered over a dozen website names relating to variations of the different subtitles.
The domains currently all redirect to the main Sony Pictures website.
The new film is due to start filming later this year and will star British actor Tom Holland as the superhero and his alter-ego Peter Parker, a role previously played on screen by fellow Brit Andrew Garfield and by Tobey Maguire.
The filmmakers have previously said that in this new incarnation Peter Parker will be a high school student.
Some of the registered titles could be symbolically referring to the young superhero coming to terms with his potential.
Sony has controlled the movie rights to the Marvel Comics character since 1999.
Last year they struck a deal with Disney owned Marvel Studios that now allows Spider-Man to appear on-screen in the hugely successful Marvel cinematic universe - home to characters including Robert Downey Junior's Iron Man and Chris Evans's Captain America.
And the web-slinger will be seen alongside those and other Avengers characters in this month's Captain America: Civil War.
The deal also allows those characters to potentially appear in the new Spider-Man series which Marvel Studios is producing for Sony.
In the past film studios registering web domains has led to the titles of films being revealed before they're officially announced. Most notably with the Bond film Skyfall in 2011.
Studios have also sometimes registered titles that have never come to be used.
The new Spider-Man film is due to be released July 2017.
