[SN]TITLE[SN]
Extradited Hong Kong rapist Joseph Tsang's jail term upheld

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted rapist, who was extradited to the UK from Hong Hong, has failed to get his 15-year prison term reduced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Tsang, 32, from Oxford, fled to Hong Kong before his trial and was convicted in August last year at Oxford Crown Court of two counts of rape and two counts of sexual assault.
He did not begin his sentence until February when he returned to the UK.
Lawyers argued the Chinese national's sentence was too tough, but it has been upheld at London's Appeal Court.
Mr Justice Jeremy Baker told the court Tsang, who was an IT worker, was also a "well-known'" ice skater who used social media to contact two teenage girls - who were aged 14 and 15 at the time.
He raped one of his victims in Hampshire.
Tsang, who was arrested in Hong Kong in September 2015, was also convicted of other sexual offences earlier that year, including three counts of sexual activity with a child under 16.
These offences happened in Oxford.
Judge Patrick Eccles, who sentenced Tsang, described him as "a predatory man with an unhealthy sexual fascination with adolescent girls".
"We are satisfied that the sentence of 15 years properly reflects Tsang's sexual criminality in respect of these two vulnerable girls," Mr Justice Jeremy Baker concluded.
