ANZ shares suspended after part of results released

Shares in ANZ have been suspended from trade after the lender accidentally published part of its full-year profit results, due on Friday.

The Australian firm requested the halt after a spreadsheet meant for analysts and fund managers was posted on its website on Friday.
It contained detailed financial data including the unaudited percentage change in cash profit for each division and geographic region.
ANZ shares will trade again on Tuesday.
In a statement, the lender said the information was "partial analytical data only" meant to "assist market participants" preparing their forecasts for ANZ's full-year results.
"Nonetheless, out of an abundance of caution, ANZ has sought a trading halt until the close of trading on the ASX today," it said.
This isn't the first time a bank has released their results early by accident.
Earlier this year, a financial supplement to JPMorgan's third quarter earnings was in circulation hours before its scheduled time because of "human error" at an investor relations company.
In 2013, French lender Credit Agricole accidentally published an investor presentation on its website the night before its earnings announcement.
Other large companies that have inadvertently seen their results released early include Google, Walt Disney and Gap.
