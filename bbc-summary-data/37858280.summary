The Championship club's owner Fawaz Al Hasawi has confirmed the deal has now entered a period of exclusivity with one potential investor.
The prospective buyers are believed to be a United States consortium, led by John Jay Moores.
"We expect this process to last between six to eight weeks, but are working to close this deal as soon as possible," Al Hasawi told the club website.
"Over this period, we will continue to work together to make decisions in the best long-term interests of the football club."
The announcement came 24 hours after the Kuwaiti appeared to say goodbye to fans on Twitter.
"I would like to wish all the supporters, the staff and the players all the best," Al Hasawi said.
"I tried my best to take the club to the next level, but unfortunately it did not work out."
The Kuwaiti, who took over the club in 2012, last month denied reports that he is demanding a large annual salary and huge bonuses as part of any takeover deal.
Forest are 20th in the table, just a point above the relegation zone, after a run of one win in 10 league games.
Al Hasawi added: "I hope that after the new takeover things would turn out as planned.
"At the end of the day I will always remain a supporter to this legendary football club."
