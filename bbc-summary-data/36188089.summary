The event at the TPC Louisiana was shortened to three rounds after several delays due to rain and thunderstorms.
Stuard, 33, was level at 15 under with compatriot Jamie Lovemark and South Korean An Byeong-hun after 54 holes.
He won at the second extra hole, the par-five 18th, after a superb third shot to three feet led to a birdie.
After disruption on both Thursday and Saturday, only three hours of play were possible on Sunday because of further bad weather.
When the tournament resumed on Monday, world number one Jason Day had four birdies in six holes in a closing 66 to finish two shots off the lead.
