[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The head teacher of a school where a pupil died after a wall fell on her has told an inquiry there had been a proposal to remove the structure before the accident.

Stephen Kelly said the work did not go ahead because of a lack of funds.
Keane Wallis-Bennett, 12, died at Liberton High School in April 2014.
But Mr Kelly told a fatal accident inquiry there had been no concerns over the wall and the proposal to remove it was part of a refurbishment programme.
Earlier, a teacher told the inquiry no one had reported concerns about the structure to her.
Mhairi Henderson said she had never seen anything about the fabric of the building that caused her concern.
She said she could not recall any pupil saying the modesty wall was wobbly.
The hearing in Edinburgh has previously heard of the moments after the wall collapsed and crushed Keane to death.
In a statement read to the inquiry on Tuesday, PE teacher Kerry Sweeney said she heard a bang from a girls' changing room.
She said she heard pupils shouting and saw panic on their faces. She described how she found a wall on top of Keane.
She said the pupil was lifeless, not conscious or breathing.
Both Ms Sweeney and head of PE Stuart Robertson said no-one had previously reported any problems with the modesty wall.
In her opening remarks on Monday, Sheriff Principal Mhairi Stephen said the two-week inquiry would focus on why the wall collapsed, why it collapsed when it did and the property maintenance regime at the school.
The inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court continues.
