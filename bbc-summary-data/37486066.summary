Edinburgh's Duncan Weir & Kevin Bryce face spell on sidelines

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh and Scotland fly-half Duncan Weir faces a spell on the sidelines after suffering a fractured jaw in last Saturday's Pro12 defeat at Munster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Weir, 25, who started the club's first four games of the season, was forced off after a clash of heads with CJ Stander and had surgery on Sunday.
In Weir's absence, fellow stand-off Jason Tovey has made a timely return to training this week from a wrist injury.
But prop Kevin Bryce is waiting to discover the extent of an elbow injury.
Bryce, starting his first game at tight-head since his summer conversion from hooker, suffered the injury at the first scrum in Limerick and had to be taken off after just six minutes.  He is awaiting the results of a scan.
The club are already without another tight-head, Simon Berghan, who is still some weeks away from returning from a foot injury.
Head coach Alan Solomons is keen to bring in extra tight-head cover with only Nick Beavon - in his first season of professional rugby - left as back-up to Scotland first-choice WP Nel.
With inside centre Phil Burleigh, who has also played at fly-half, still recovering from a shoulder injury and Tovey only just returning to training, 19-year-old Blair Kinghorn - who replaced Weir in Limerick - could feature at 10 in Friday's Pro12 match with Connacht in Galway.
Third-choice hooker George Turner has also joined the casualty list after sustaining an ankle injury playing for Heriot's in the BT Premiership on Saturday.
But back-row Nasi Manu, who suffered a rib injury in Edinburgh's opening-day defeat at Cardiff Blues, has returned to training this week.
Edinburgh will discover on Wednesday if lock Fraser McKenzie will be banned after being cited for a shoulder charge at a ruck that knocked out Munster flanker Jack O'Donoghue.
They are already without another second-row, Anton Bresler, as he recovers from groin surgery.
Loose-head prop Alasdair Dickinson is on track for a return to training in late October, with Scotland's autumn Tests starting against Australia on 12 November.
