Kilmarnock-born Eric Cyl, 62, was last seen heading off into the Mamore mountain range near Fort William at the end of May.
Tom Brown, 65, was last seen leaving his Lanarkshire home on 1 July.
RAF and Lochaber mountain rescue teams made searches of Meall Cumhann over the weekend.
Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team said: "We have now covered all potential routes that either of these missing persons could have taken from their last known locations.
"We would ask any walkers in Glen Nevis, Mamores, Grey Corries, Aonach Beag and Carn Dearg areas to keep their eyes open for items of gear and clothing.
"We will keep looking."
The team added: "The family also wish us to pass on their thanks to all the teams/dogs/people who have contributed to the massive effort so far."
Mr Cyl, who was walking alone, was last seen wearing a light grey jacket and dark trousers and was carrying two walking poles.
A rucksack belonging to Mr Brown was found less than a mile east of Steall Falls in the Glen Nevis area on 9 July.
Mr Brown is 5ft 10in and has grey/brown hair.
