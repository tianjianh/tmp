A coroner has recorded a verdict of accidental death on five members of a family who died in a house fire in Sheffield last year.

Shabina Begum and her grandchildren Adyan Parwaiz Kayani, nine, Amaan, seven and nine-week-old Minahil, died, along with their aunt Anum Parwaiz.
The inquest heard Mrs Begum had the chance to escape the fire on Wake Road on 28 April but tried to rescue the children.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
Coroner Christopher Dorries commended the efforts of the grandmother in trying to rescue her family and praised firefighters who risked their own lives to get to the victims.
Giving evidence at the inquest in Sheffield, another of Mrs Begum's daughters Sadaf Parwaiz described how she and her mother unsuccessfully tried to fight the fire in the lounge of the terraced house.
She said her mother opened the front door and had a chance to escape, but wanted to save the children.
Ms Parwaiz told the inquest she noticed a "sparkle" in the lounge when she came down to collect her mobile phone shortly after midnight.
Firefighter Barry Ainsworth said it was the hottest domestic fire he had been to in his 25 years of service.
The inquest heard evidence that investigators had failed to establish an exact cause of the fire and there was no direct evidence a phone charger was to blame.
