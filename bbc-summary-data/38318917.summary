Shawlands locals disappointed by 'caged' Christmas tree

A community Christmas tree in part of Glasgow looks like it has been "caged", according to disappointed residents.

The tree, which stands on a traffic island in the Shawlands area, is surrounded by a tall metal fence.
Many local people have vented their feelings on the community council's Facebook page, with one woman claiming the tree looked like it was "trapped".
Glasgow City Council said the tree was fenced off for safety reasons and to ensure the lights were not pulled off.
Dorothy Boyd branded the tree "hideous" on Shawlands and Strathbungo community council's social media page.
Meanwhile Carol Meldrum wrote: "The poor thing looks like it's trapped", and William Love posted: "What an eyesore... nae common sense."
The community council had hoped the fence could be replaced with a lower crowd control barrier.
But they have been told the high fence has to stay because because contractors are concerned about the risk of a member of the public coming into contact with mains electricity if they climb over the railing.
Community council chairman Gary Cushway said: "It seems it's the contractors that have refused to sign off for health and safety reasons.
"There is a feeling that if you are going to make the effort to put the tree up, then make it look half reasonable rather than just throwing it up.
"It needs to be safe but there are a lot of families around the area and the children would like to have it looking nice. Perhaps the fence could be decorated to make it look nicer.
"Some people have said it looks like it has been caged."
The community council hopes to begin negotiating with the city council early next year in the hope of finding a better solution for the festive tree in 2017.
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council, which is responsible for the tree, said: "The Christmas tree in Shawlands had Heras fencing installed around it by our contractors for safety reasons and also to ensure lights are not pulled off, as has happened on occasion in some locations.
"The installation of such fencing depends on a site specific assessment by the installation contractor.
"It should be noted that the Christmas tree in Shawlands was moved from its usual location at Shawlands Cross because of public realm work taking place there, and as always, we will review locations for next year."
The council said a number of the city's 26 neighbourhood Christmas trees have similar fencing.
