[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Royal Mail is issuing 10 stamps featuring British bees that go on sale on Tuesday.
One of them, the large Mason bee, is only found at two sites on the Llyn Peninsula, Gwynedd.
Jane Moseley from the British Beekeepers Association said: "We are delighted that Royal Mail has created these stamps."
The set of stamps feature the scabious bee, great yellow bumblebee, northern colletes bee, bilberry bumblebee, large Mason bee and the potter flower bee.
Royal Mail worked with Simon G. Potts, professor of biodiversity and ecosystem services at Reading University to produce them.
The stamps were designed by artist Richard Lewington, from Appleton in Oxfordshire.
