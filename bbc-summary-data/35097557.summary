Mr Trump had been under pressure to release his medical history after several other candidates had done so.
The 69-year-old real estate tycoon would become the oldest president to be elected in US history.
However, his physician said he would be the "healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".
New York City-based physician Harold Bornstein said his physical strength and stamina are "extraordinary".
Promising to release it a few weeks ago, he tweeted that his medical report would show "perfection".
The release follows other presidential candidates including Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Jeb Bush sharing their medical histories.
"I am fortunate to have been blessed with great genes," Mr Trump wrote on Facebook. "People have been impressed by my stamina, but to me it has been easy because I am truly doing something that I love."
Mr Bornstein writes in a note that he has been Mr Trump's personal physician since 1980, and that in 39 years, he has had no major issues.
His blood pressure and laboratory tests are "astonishingly excellent"  and he has lost 15 pounds (7kg) in the past year, according to Mr Bornstein.
He said Mr Trump has had no forms of cancer, or joint surgery, and does not smoke or drink alcohol.
Mr Trump has said Ms Clinton may not have the "stamina" to be president.
Her physician described the presidential candidate as a "healthy 67-year-old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies", with a concussion, elbow fracture and blood clot in her record.
Ms Clinton does exercise regularly and eats a diet "rich in lean protein", physician Lisa Bardack noted.
Jeb Bush's doctor, Alberto Mitranin, described him as a "healthy a vigorous 62-year-old man" in "excellent physical and mental condition".
