This is one of Nottinghamshire's largest police inquiries for several years.
At the heart of this inquiry is the old Beechwood Children's Home in Mapperley, where a number of former residents claim they suffered horrific physical and sexual abuse.
The investigation has been complex because some of these allegations go back more than 40 years, making it difficult to corroborate details of where abuse allegedly took place, and who carried out that abuse.
James Cleverley said he tried to get help from police, but was not believed at the time.
Mr Cleverley, now 53, said the abuse had affected him throughout his life, and he still takes sleeping tablets and anti-depressants.
"I break down sometimes when I feel a bit down and if I've had a drink that's even worse; the memories just come flooding back," he said.
"At night time I wake up and even though I'm on very high sleeping tablets I still wake up with nightmares.
"Mentally I can never forget it, never."
He said he was also abused when he went to other homes.
"Every home I went to it seemed like they knew that I was the sort of lad that they could do that to, to abuse me," he said.
"It seemed like a big paedophile ring."
He said he went to a mental hospital for a while and has been "in and out of prison".
"It's hard for me to have a relationship with people now, especially men, my friends, because I think to myself they did it to me when I was younger, they might try it with me now," he said.
"They were supposed to be there to look after me, not to abuse me."
