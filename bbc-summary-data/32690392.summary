The 20-year-old, who played for the Old Trafford club at the youth tournament, has featured regularly for the Red Devils first team this season.
"I played in the competition two years in succession and it was a fantastic experience," said McNair.
United are back at the Milk Cup this year, competing in the Premier Section.
The club have been to 12 finals, winning six titles and they will be attempting to become the first team ever to secure three successive victories after triumphs over County Tyrone in 2013 and French club Vendee last year.
"I'm proud to be asked to make the Milk Cup draw," added McNair, who played in the 2011 and 2012 competitions.
"It makes me proud to see the Milk Cups won by the club displayed in the trophy room at Old Trafford.
"That alone indicates how much prestige is placed on the competition at Manchester United."
Impressive displays in the Premier League earned McNair a call-up to the Northern Ireland squad with his first appearance coming in a 1-0 defeat to the Scots at Hampden Park.
Among the newcomers at the Milk Cup this year are Zacatepec from Mexico in the Junior Section.
Another Mexican outfit, Club America, will contest the Premier Section which has again attracted the popular Strikers from California and OC Blues, who are based in the suburbs of Los Angeles.
Japan will be represented by Higashi Fukuoka and long-time supporters Otago from New Zealand are back once more for the 26-31 July tournament.
