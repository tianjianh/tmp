Andrew Bache, 51, from Portsmouth is in a critical condition after Russian fans went on the rampage with iron bars in Marseille on Saturday.
Dean Bache said his brother was still unconscious after being put in an induced coma.
But he had briefly opened his eyes and moved his arms, he said.
Mr Bache, who is also known as Pepe, suffered a cardiac arrest, extensive brain injuries and a lung infection after being attacked before England's match against Russia.
He opened his eyes when his son Harry visited him in hospital, Dean said in a message posted on a fundraising page.
Friends who launched an appeal to help him have so far raised more than Â£19,000 towards a Â£30,000 target.
Dean Bache said his brother would "have an operation in 10-15 days to repair his broken face".
He said: "I'm not ashamed to say I cried for the first time today...I was talking to him... and held his hand and he closed his hand and gripped mine."
Chief Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Mr Bache had been beaten around the head by Russians armed with iron bars.
A message from Dean Bache, shared on Facebook, read: "I was told that the chief inspector of the local police has informed them that they have excellent CCTV footage of the attack and have indentified those involved and pictures have been forwarded to French police."
