A Â£20,000 reward has been offered for information on a shooting in a south-west London park in what is believed to be a case of mistaken identity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Moses Ssendawula, 41, was killed as he walked in Burgess Park, Camberwell at about 01:00 BST on 8 September, 2007.
A post-mortem examination revealed he had been shot in the back and shoulder.
Since 2007, three people have been arrested in connection with the murder but all have been released without further action.
Mr Ssendawula was making his way through Burgess Park close to the entrance at St George's Way when he was shot, police said.
At the time he was wearing a blue checked shirt, black trousers and a light coloured woollen hat.
The weapon used, a 9mm handgun, has never been recovered.
Det Insp Peter Hine said: "Moses was well known in the African community for the voluntary work he undertook. He dedicated his time steering teenagers away from crime.
"Eight years is a very long time to go without any answers...someone out there must know something and I would urge them to come forward and speak to us.
"Whatever the reasons for you not coming forward at the time don't let that stop you from coming forward now."
