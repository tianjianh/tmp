Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said on Twitter that Mr Trump should give up his presidential ambitions because he would never win.
It follows Mr Trump's call for Muslims to be barred from entering the US for security reasons.
Mr Trump tweeted back, calling the prince "dopey".
"You are a disgrace not only to the GOP [Republican Party] but to all America," Prince Alwaleed tweeted.
"Withdraw from the US presidential race as you will never win."
Mr Trump responded by accusing the prince of wanting to use what he called "daddy's money" to control US politicians.
That would not happen, Mr Trump said, when he got elected.
Mr Trump, the frontrunner for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has been widely criticised for his call for a ban on Muslims entering the US.
On Thursday, Damac Properties - a Dubai firm building a golf complex with Mr Trump - removed his name and image from the property.
His comments came following the California shootings, carried out by two Muslims who the FBI said were radicalised.
