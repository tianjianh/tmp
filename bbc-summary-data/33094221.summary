[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The permission for the mining of gold, silver and lead includes approval for a further 15 years of work by Omagh Minerals at Cavanacaw near Omagh.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said the project "was a real boost in terms of jobs and investment for the area".
He added that "environmental protection will be of paramount importance".
It is anticipated that 130 people will be employed on site once fully operational.
The extension will see underground works within the mine site area extend to a length of 600 metres and a depth of up to 350 metres.
The extension will include the progressive restoration of the above-ground site to ensure the protection and enhancement of landscape and habitat over time.
Mr Durkan said: "The proposed operation by Omagh Minerals should help create numerous jobs and secure existing ones at the site.
"These, and the wider benefits the development will bring will help the local economy.
"Environmental protection will be of paramount importance. The company will be operating within strict compliance parameters.
"This combination will help achieve my vision of creating a stronger economy, a better environment."
Omagh Minerals is owned by Galantas Gold Corporation.
The company expects to invest between £17m and £20m in the project.
