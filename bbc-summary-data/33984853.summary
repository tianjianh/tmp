[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mother and son sentenced for keeping children in 'unhygienic' house

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother and son who allowed two children live in an "unhygienic" house described as a "hovel", have been sentenced at Limavady Magistrate's Court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pair pleaded guilty to cruelty charges.
The defendants cannot be named because of the nature of the case nor can their address be made public.
The mother was put on probation for six months and her son was put on probation for 18 months.
A public prosecution service solicitor told the district judge that police searched the home of the defendants under the Misuse of Drugs Act.
The son, who is a cannabis addict, pointed out to the police a quantity of the drug in his bedroom.
The prosecutor said very few of the rooms in the house had working lights and the police had to use torches during the search operation.
"One of the officers had to leave the house to be physically sick outside because of the state of the property." the prosecutor said.
A social worker was called by the police to come to the house.
The police also called a CSI photographer to photograph the conditions they found inside the house.
The prosecution solicitor said the two children were at a church event.
They were both clean and healthy and the police and the social services arranged for them to stay with other family members.
The male defendant was interviewed and told police he was responsible for the children for several days.
His mother, who was on holiday, told the police on her return that she accepted the house was in a bad state of disrepair and it had been for a long time.
She accepted it was not an appropriate place for children to be staying in.
Defence barristers for both defendants said neither had any previous criminal convictions.
They said since the incident they had spent a lot of money improving the condition of the house where the children still live.
They described the case as "tragic".
Photographs of the original and of the current condition of the house were handed in to the district judge.
The judge said the bottom line in the case was that "two children of tender age lived in conditions which were atrocious and a hovel."
He said it was the duty of the court to protect young children.
However he said he took into account the fact that both children were clean and healthy and that the defendants had engaged with and were continuing to work with the social services.
He said he was satisfied that both defendants were looking after the needs of the children and he also took into consideration the previous good character of the mother and her son and the fact that they pleaded guilty at the earliest stage.
He said he did not believe it was appropriate to send them to jail.
