Staff at Inverness-based Lifescan Scotland were informed of the development by management on Tuesday.
It comes after parent company Johnson and Johnson announced it was reviewing its strategic options.
LifeScan makes products for the treatment of diabetes and currently employs 1,100 people in the Highland capital.
The products include meters and software to let people self-monitor their blood glucose levels.
Johnson and Johnson reported slower than expected sales to the financial markets on Tuesday and said they were looking to sell or find partners or other options for Lifescan.
Last summer Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) invested Â£1.8m in Lifescan to support 600 existing jobs.
