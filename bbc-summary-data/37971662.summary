Pat Perez shot a four-under par 67 in Sunday's final round to finish 21 under to win, with overnight leader American Gary Woodland two strokes back.
Knox, 31, carded a final-day five-under-par 66 on the Greg Norman-designed El Camaleon course.
"I wasn't all that comfortable out there. This course kind of makes you put the steer on sometimes," he said.
"But I made seven birdies. A couple of mistakes, but overall starting the day I would have taken 66."
Compatriot Martin Laird tied for 13th at 13 under par, while Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell finished two shots further back in tied 24th.
