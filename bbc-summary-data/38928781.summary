Rio Tinto climbed 5.6%, Antofagasta rose 4.9% and Anglo American was up 4.8%.
The shares were boosted by data from China showing better-than-expected growth in imports and exports last month, and this lifted metal prices.
In the FTSE 250, shares in Just Eat fell 6.5% after the chief executive of the online food delivery firm, David Buttress, said he was standing down due to "urgent family matters".
Greene King shares fell 3.2% following the pub operator's latest trading update. The company said underlying sales rose 4.5% over the Christmas period, driven by strong sales in London.
On the currency markets, the pound was given a brief boost by the release of stronger-than-expected manufacturing figures.
However, the spike in sterling did not last, and by 1630gmt the pound was little changed against the dollar at $1.2505 and up 0.14% against the euro at 1.1742 euros.
