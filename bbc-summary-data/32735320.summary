Students occupy Edinburgh University overnight

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Students have spent a night occupying an Edinburgh University building in protest at its "failure to commit" to divestment from fossil fuels.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At least 30 students occupied Charles Stewart House in Chambers Street, which is home to the university's finance department.
The students said calls for divestment had received "overwhelming support".
An Edinburgh University spokesman said it supported the right of all students to protest lawfully and peacefully.
The students said the university invested about Â£9m in fossil fuel companies including BP, Shell and BHP Billiton.
The university had established a Fossil Fuels Review Group to look into the issue.
The university announced on Tuesday that it will continue to invest in fossil fuel companies, but said it will use its research activities and "responsible investment" to work with them to reduce their emissions.
