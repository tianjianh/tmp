A Conservative MP has surrendered his rifles and shotguns after forgetting to renew his firearms certificate.

Ian Liddell-Grainger received a letter from Avon and Somerset Police informing him his certificate had run expired, the Somerset County Gazette reported.
The MP for Bridgwater and West Somerset said he was "appalled" it would take 16 weeks to issue a new one, accusing the force of "utter incompetence".
Avon and Somerset Police refused to respond to the MP's comments.
"Forgetting to check and renew a licence in time is a simple mistake that anyone can make - and I make mistakes like everyone else," the Tory said.
"But I cannot believe how long it's going take to deal with a simple renewal of an existing certificate.
"Sixteen weeks to complete one piece of paperwork looks like utter incompetence.
"When I mentioned the fact that I was a MP, it was suggested that if the government gave the force some more money they might be able to get these things done more quickly."
