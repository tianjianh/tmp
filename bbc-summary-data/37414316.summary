[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff City 0-2 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby claimed their second Championship win of the season as they beat Cardiff without manager Nigel Pearson following his suspension by the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In Pearson's absence Chris Powell took charge of the Rams, who led thanks to Tom Ince's low second-half strike.
Nick Blackman scored with a penalty after he was tripped by Matt Connolly, who was sent off for the foul.
Victory lifts Derby up to 20th in the table, with Cardiff taking their place in the relegation zone.
Derby's players were only told about Pearson's suspension three hours before kick-off in south Wales, and the news made for a sense of bemusement inside the Cardiff City Stadium.
Although the visitors enjoyed more possession, Cardiff had the better chances in a low-key first half, the best falling to Sean Morrison, whose free header was well saved by Scott Carson.
Derby improved after the break and took a deserved lead when Ince fired past Cardiff's scrambling defence to score what was only the Rams' fourth goal in 10 Championship matches this season.
The Bluebirds' fate was sealed when Connolly saw red for tripping Blackman and denying him a scoring opportunity, with the Derby substitute calmly converting the spot-kick himself to condemn Cardiff to a sixth defeat from 10 league games.
