Braintree Town 0-1 Solihull Moors

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Harry White converted a late penalty as Solihull Moors ended a three-game losing run with victory over Braintree at Cressing Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts went closest to making the breakthrough in the first half when Lee Barnard's header hit the crossbar on 16 minutes as Solihull struggled to clear their lines.
But the visitors finished off a game of few chances when White slotted home from 12 yards - his team's first goal in four games - four minutes from time, after Andy Brown had been brought down by Ian Gayle.
Solihull remained 15th in the National League despite the win, although they now have a nine-point cushion over Braintree in the relegation zone.
