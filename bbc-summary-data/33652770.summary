Happisburgh beach rocks moved to protect crumbling cliffs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huge rock sea defences designed to slow down erosion on the Norfolk coast are to be moved closer to crumbling cliffs.

About 9,000 tonnes of the rock will be re-aligned on Happisburgh beach over the next 12 weeks.
Beach debris, old sea defences, timber, rubble, concrete and sheet steel piles will also be removed so sea defences will be ready for any winter storms.
A consultant archaeologist will work with contractors as numerous historical finds have been made in the area.
In May 2013 the beach revealed the earliest human footprints outside Africa.
Hand-axes have also been found indicating that the area had been home to the earliest human occupation in northern Europe.
The huge rocks at Happisburgh were set down following the failure of previous sea defences.
Now the cliff has receded further so the rocks need to be moved closer to land to be more effective.
The work will cost up to Â£75,000, depending on the debris that needs clearing, and will start on Monday.
Angie Fitch-Tillett, cabinet member at North Norfolk District Council, said: "This work is essential and it needs to be undertaken when the beach level and weather conditions are good.
"I know the community has been waiting for the work to happen, although it is unfortunate that it'll take place during the peak holiday season."
The car park, new play area and beach access ramp will remain open but people will only be able to walk on the long sandy stretch to the east.
