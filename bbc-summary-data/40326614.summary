A number of patients have been moved out of a hospital in Lincolnshire after fire inspectors identified issues with the "aging fabric of the building".

Lincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust said it had reduced the number of beds from 50 to 16 across two wards at Louth Hospital.
It said the move was "a precautionary measure" and was not in response to the Grenfell Tower fire in west London.
Patients have been transferred to other community hospitals or care providers.

Lisa Green, director of nursing and operations at the trust, said: "Following a scheduled fire safety inspection at County Hospital, Louth, we have been made aware that, due to the aging fabric of the building, some remedial works will be required."
"In light of the duty of care we have to our patients and staff, we have temporarily reduced the number of beds available on both Manby and Carlton wards and increased the number of staff to ensure any potential risk can be mitigated," she said.
The trust said it expected to review the decision later this week based on guidance from the fire service.
Its website states that Carlton ward is for the rehabilitation of local patients who have been moved from larger hospitals after the acute phase of their illness is over.
Manby Ward provides cardiac monitoring facilities for patients who require more intensive care and support.
NHS Property Services, which owns the hospital, said it was upgrading the fire detection and alarm system, improving fire exit signage, lighting and making improvements to escape routes and fire doors and walls.
A spokesman said: "NHS Property Services is already investing Â£1.1m in a fire safety and asbestos removal project at the hospital and further works are being commissioned as a priority."
