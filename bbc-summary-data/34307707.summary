The Whitby-based William Riley aided in the rescue of 145 people on board the hospital ship SS Rohilla, when it sank off the Yorkshire coast in 1914.
A group of York fundraisers called the Ales Angles joined RNLI volunteers to row the boat the 16 miles between Newburn and Tynemouth.
The vessel was restored by the Whitby Historic Trust.
The row started at Newburn Sailing Club at 09:30 BST on Saturday, ending four hours later at the mouth of the Tyne.
Tynemouth RNLI spokesman Adrian Don, said: "The row was completed over an hour earlier than expected thanks to a fast-flowing ebb tide.
"This was a great opportunity for our volunteer crew members to get a taste of what it was like to crew a lifeboat a century ago.
"Our volunteers really enjoyed the experience, despite a few blisters on their hands."
The William Riley tours the country raising money for the RNLI.
