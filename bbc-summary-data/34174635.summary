A solo kayaker has completed his trip around all of Scotland's lifeboat stations to raise money for charity.

Nick Ray set off on the 2,015-mile trip in May and took more than four months to finish the challenge.
The 51-year-old started at Kippford on the Solway Firth and travelled clockwise before finishing in Eyemouth in the Borders.
He visited 47 lifeboat stations on the journey and hoped to raise thousands of pounds for the RNLI.
Mr Ray, who lives in a yacht in a marina at the Isle of Kerrara, near Oban, said his trip had been inspired by Brian Wilson's account of his solo sea kayak journey around Scotland in the 1980s.
He tweeted that it had been a "privilege" to raise funds for the RNLI with the trip and thanked everyone for their "words of congratulations".
