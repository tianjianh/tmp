Arthur Collins, 24, is charged with 14 counts of wounding with intent and one of throwing corrosive fluid on a person.
Twenty people were hurt - including two each blinded in one eye - when they were doused with a substance at the Mangle E8 club in Hackney on 17 April.
A man aged 21 has also been charged.
Andre Phoenix faces seven counts of grievous bodily harm.
Mr Collins, from Hertfordshire, was arrested at an address in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
He and Mr Phoenix will appear at Thames Magistrates Court in London on Monday.
The Metropolitan Police said a man and a 22-year-old woman both lost their sight in one eye after the incident. Other people were treated for severe burns.
The substance has not yet been confirmed but samples retrieved from the scene have been sent for analysis.
The man blinded in one eye and another victim, a 29-year-old man, were transferred to a specialist burns hospital in Essex and have since been discharged.
A 24-year-old old man arrested in north London over the attack on Friday has since been released.
