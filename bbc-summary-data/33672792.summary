Mr Bowers lashed out at the former Miss Wales Sophia Cahill after she asked him why he had glitter on his face, Croydon Magistrates' Court heard.
He allegedly swore, grabbed at her and pulled her hair. She said she was left with a bloody nose and bruises.
Mr Bowers, 35, denies assault by beating.
The court heard the couple of three years had split up in November last year but were living with Mr Bowers' parents in Croydon, south London.
When Ms Cahill went to wake him on 29 January 2015 she said she spotted the glitter on his face and questioned him about it.
"I pointed to the glitter on his face. I had caught him in bed with somebody [before] - that obviously gave us trust issues," she told the court.
"We said that if we are still living under the same roof we would not do anything to disrespect each other and do anything with other people.
"He had been out all night and obviously I jumped to conclusions because of other things he has done in the past."
Mr Bowers is a former Brit School student and became famous as a member of R&B band Another Level.
He also recorded a duet with Victoria Beckham after the group split, went on to appear in Celebrity Big Brother in 2010 and also appeared on the ITV2 show The Big Reunion last year.
Mr Bowers had been changing one of Ms Cahill's two children at the time of the alleged attack when he is accused of grabbing her by the shoulder and pushing her out of the bedroom, the court was told.
Ms Cahill alleges that he hit her after she slapped him in the face. She also claims that she fell to the floor and he started dragging her, at first by her clothes and later by her hair.
"I could not breathe. He was really really aggressive. He was angry. He was just crazy," she told the court.
"He was on my back. He was squeezing my throat and my head was still pulled back by my hair. My head was pulled back as far as it could go. He was leaning on my face. He was just swearing at me."
Ms Cahill said Mr Bowers then hit her on her nose, which was healing following surgery six months before, and she began to bleed.
Mr Bowers' defence lawyer John Blandford argued that it was Ms Cahill who was the aggressor.
In a prepared statement given to police in February, he said: "I never pushed her to the floor or pulled her hair. At all times I was acting in self-defence."
Mr Bowers told police he managed to get her out of the room where he was changing the baby but she was pounding him on his chest.
In the statement he said "she began hitting me again and I was deflecting her blows".
The hearing has been adjourned until 14 September.
