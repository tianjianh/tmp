Joe Burgess and Lewis Tierney: Wigan Warriors wingers out for four to six weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan wingers Joe Burgess and Lewis Tierney will miss four to six weeks respectively after picking up ankle and knee injuries in last week's 20-0 Super League win against Leigh.

Burgess, 22, was withdrawn after half an hour, while Tierney, also 22, was brought off at half-time.
Prop Ryan Sutton, 21, is also expected to miss a "few weeks" with an eye injury picked up in the same game.
All three players were assessed in hospital after the game.
"We've got a few missing," coach Shaun Wane told BBC Radio Manchester. "None of the lads are long-term, they're all four-to-six weeks.
"The good thing is we've got a few good kids coming in."
The loss of Burgess and Tierney is compounded by the long-term absence of fellow winger Dominic Manfredi, who suffered a cruciate ligament injury in August 2016 and is yet to return for Shaun Wane's side.
