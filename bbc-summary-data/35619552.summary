In a dour first half, Louis Moult gave the home side the advantage from the penalty spot.
If the visiting fans expected a second-half response they were to be disappointed, with Moult doubling Motherwell's lead.
Marvin Johnson made sure of the points, with Callum Booth's late strike Thistle's only consolation.
It might have been a different story had either David Amoo or Mathias Pogba scored in the immediate aftermath of Booth's goal, but neither was able to finish and Motherwell were able to see out their second win in three matches.

The result, their first win at home in 2016, lifts them four points clear of the relegation play-off spot.
They looked the hungrier side throughout and even in a first period that lacked many goalscoring opportunities, they possessed greater attacking threat.
Moult had the ball in the net after Scott McDonald had set him up on the rebound from Johnson's shot, only for the assistant's flag to frustrate the home fans.
But the striker did break the deadlock, sending Tomas Cerny the wrong way after Keith Lasley was fouled in the penalty area by Aidan Nesbitt.
As important as that goal was, Moult's second represented the first moment of real class in the match.
McDonald played a superb reverse pass into his path and he shot powerfully on the turn past Cerny.
Johnson's third was another impressive effort, as he cut in from the right to flash a ferocious drive into the back of the net.
Motherwell were untroubled until Booth seemed to catch Connor Ripley by surprise with a long-range effort.
The keeper was only able to push the ball into his own goal, perhaps taken aback at finally having some involvement in the match.
He was not punished further, though, as Motherwell comfortably saw out the closing stages to send their supporters home happy.
