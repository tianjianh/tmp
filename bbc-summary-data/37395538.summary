Wheelchair athlete Sarah Piercy was in the cockpit of the machine at the World Human Powered Speed Challenge in Nevada, USA.
Plymouth University, which designed the machine, said the run of 24.85mph beat the previous record by 0.1mph.
Ms Piercy, from Exeter, said: "It's been he greatest sporting challenge of my life."
She and the team spent six months testing the machine, which Ms Piercy used her arms and hands to power along the 200m (656ft) challenge track at Battle Mountain.
She said: "Just a year ago, I would never have believed this could be possible but I owe everything to Adam Kyte and the Plymouth University engineering students who have made this happen."
Project leader Mr Kyte, lecturer in mechanical and marine engineering design at Plymouth University, said he and the team were "absolutely thrilled".
"It was an incredible effort and the result of sheer determination on her part," he said.
Ms Piercy has a condition called arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, which can lead to a contracting of the joints.
She has completed 10 London marathons in a wheelchair.
