Former Hull City academy player Margetts, 22, only joined Rovers in the summer and has scored two goals for them in nine National League games.
However, he spent a month with National League North side Stockport in December and found the net four times.
"Hopefully get a few goals and help the team get some good results," Margetts posted on social media.
The forward is Altrincham's third loan addition this month, following the signings of Josh Ginnelly from Burnley and Dylan Mottley-Henry from Bradford.
Meanwhile defender Tom Marshall and winger George Bowerman have signed dual registration deals with Stafford Rangers and AFC Telford United respectively.
