Portsmouth midfielder Ben Close believes they can produce an unbeaten run to sustain their challenge for promotion from League Two.

Pompey's 1-0 home defeat against fellow promotion challengers Oxford United on Saturday saw them slip seven points behind the top three.
"It wasn't our day, but there's plenty of games and plenty of points left to play for," Close told BBC Radio Solent.
Portsmouth face an FA Cup fourth-round tie at home to Bournemouth on Saturday.
"The gap to the top three is obviously getting bigger," added Close.
"But I've got a lot of confidence in this squad that we can get up there, finish strong and our fitness and quality will shine through in the end.
"Teams go on their unbeaten runs at different times and I think we can start ours from here."
Close, 19, came off the bench against Oxford for his first league appearance of the season and hopes to force himself into contention for the months ahead.
"There's obviously others who've been playing well in my position, so I'm waiting for my chance," he said.
"Getting little opportunities off the bench will mean I'm ready when a league start comes."
