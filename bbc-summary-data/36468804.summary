[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dorset's County Hospital is carrying out a review of services, including maternity and paediatrics.
It has prompted dozens of parents to post images of their children receiving care at the hospital in Dorchester.
Dorset Clinical Commissioning Group said it was considering how to reorganise health services for the future.
Photos shared on the group include children born prematurely and other poorly youngsters whose parents are opposed to any changes.
Among the areas under review are the special care baby unit (SCBU), Kingfisher children's ward and maternity services at the hospital.
Parents have been sharing the posts on the Save the SCBU, Kingfisher and Maternity at DCH Facebook page.
