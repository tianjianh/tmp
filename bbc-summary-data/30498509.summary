Soldiers from both sides shared an impromptu ceasefire in Ypres, Belgium, on Christmas Day 1914.
Graham Brookland of the Army FA said the match would "commemorate the occasion in an extremely good spirit".
The game, played at Aldershot Town FC in Hampshire, ended in a 1-0 win for the British Army.
Several thousand events have been held across the UK to mark the Christmas truce football match as part of Football Remembers Week.
Every team in the Premier League and Football League have marked the centenary of World War One at recent matches.
