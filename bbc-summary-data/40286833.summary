A man who stabbed a Flintshire shopkeeper in a "cowardly and frenzied" attack has been jailed for 20 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Whelan, 30, was said to be high on drink and drugs when he beat and stabbed Imtiaz ul Haq at the Costcutter store in Queensferry on 8 December last year.
Mold Crown Court heard Mr Haq, 59, was "lucky to be alive" after he suffered stab wounds to his throat and head.
Whelan, from Mancot, admitted attempted murder and robbery.
The court was told he took a knife to the shop to commit robbery and when Mr Haq went to press the alarm button, he was determined to prevent him "at all costs".
Judge Rhys Rowlands said Whelan used a knife to inflict "the most terrible injuries".
Giving evidence, Mr Haq said he knew he only had a few minutes left until "he would be no more".
A surgeon told him he had never previously seen anyone survive such an injury.
Defence barrister Andrew Green said Whelan had little recollection of what happened because he had been binging on drink and drugs, but was "genuinely remorseful".
Whelan was sentenced as a dangerous offender and must serve two thirds of his 20-year sentence before he can be considered for release.
