It increases fines and jail sentences for those who break the law and will be applied to fans and clubs alike.
"We want to make sure that fans and families can enjoy the game safely and in pleasant conditions," said Interior Minister Jorge Burgos.
Chile will host the Copa America 2015 tournament, which kicks off on Thursday.
The new law will also punish violence during training sessions, during the movement or transportation of fans, and at celebrations in public places.
Clubs could be fined for discrimination, racism and xenophobia.
"We will do all that we can to put an end to violence and give the sport the feeling of a community celebration," said Mr Burgos.
Twelve national teams from the Americas will be taking part in the tournament from 11 June to 4 July.
Football violence is a huge problem in some South American countries.
In Argentina,  the so-called Barras Bravas, gangs of radical supporters who control the terraces and the streets around the stadiums, have been blamed for many deaths in recent years.
But fans in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Brazil, among others, have also encountered violence at football matches.
