[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 0-3 Blackpool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool recorded their first league win since the opening day of the season as they eased to victory away at Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Daniel scored twice before Armand Gnanduillet tapped home in the closing stages to complete a memorable day for the Tangerines and a miserable one for their hosts.
The margin of victory could have been greater for Blackpool had Gnanduillet not skied a penalty after the bar after Liam Shephard had been adjudged to have pulled down Bright Samuel.
After a first half that was almost devoid of action, Daniel put Blackpool ahead on 59 minutes when he crashed an unstoppable 25-yard drive past Artur Krysiak.
Gnanduillet spurned the opportunity to double Blackpool's advantage from the penalty spot, but the visitors were two goals up moments later when Daniel eased Potts' cross past Krysiak.
Yeovil's misery was complete three minutes from time when Potts found Gnanduillet in space six yards out and the Frenchman was left to tap into an empty net.
