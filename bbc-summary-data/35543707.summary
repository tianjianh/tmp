Akhtar Javeed, 56, was gunned down outside his warehouse in Digbeth, Birmingham on 3 February.
Detectives are keen to speak to two people - a worker pushing a bike and a private hire taxi driver.
The businessman's daughter, Lilas Javeed, said: "My brothers will now have to become men and start life without their role model guiding them."
At about 18:30 GMT on the day of the shooting, police said, two masked men in a silver Renault Megane entered Direct Source 3 Ltd on Rea Street South.
Five staff members were handcuffed with cable ties and it appeared Mr Javeed was shot while fighting off the attackers, Det Supt Mark Payne said.
Mr Javeed was found outside his business premises with a "major neck wound" and pronounced dead in hospital.
The robbers escaped empty-handed in the Renault Megane and turned on to McDonald Street, without their vehicle lights on, detectives said. Police appealed for anyone who saw the car to come forward.
Forensic analysis of bullet cases from the premises showed the weapon that fired the fatal shot "had not been used in any other crime either locally or nationally," police said.

Police also made specific appeals for two people in the area at the time of the botched robbery.
The first was a man who was pushing a bike along Leopold Street towards Dymoke Street at about 18:20 GMT.
The second was the driver of a private hire Toyota Avensis taxi that followed the vehicle in which the masked robbers fled.
