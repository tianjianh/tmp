Brian Clough's "miracle men" won an unlikely European Cup double in 1979 and 1980 after he guided them from the bottom half of the second division.
Notts County, known as the Magpies, are being honoured for being the world's oldest league club.
Ex-Forest player John Robertson will also be celebrated at the event later.
Former ITV broadcaster Gary Newbon, who is compering the ceremony at the Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham, said it would be a "terrific night" for the city.
He said: "Normally it is done in Manchester the home of the National Football Museum, but because it's so special with these two clubs, they're coming to Nottingham."
Tommy Johnson, a former Notts County player and now coach, said the accolade for the Magpies was "long overdue" and he was looking forward to sharing the night with rivals Forest.
John Robertson proved to be a key figure in both of Forest's finals setting up the winning goal for Trevor Francis in 1979 and scoring the only goal in Forest's 1-0 win over Hamburg a year later.
He said it was a "great honour" to be inducted into the hall of fame.
"These things that have happened to me have been wonderful," he said.
"Brian Clough made me have a look at myself when I wasn't living right. I was a bit of wild boy in those days."
He added that the film I Believe in Miracles, about his team's exploits, helped put them back "in the spotlight".
Robertson's former teammate Martin O'Neill will also be at the ceremony.
Don Masson, who captained Notts County to three promotions, and Phil Turner who helped them win the Anglo Italian Cup in 1995, will also attend.
