A trucker has been caught reading a book while driving his lorry along a motorway, police have said.

Secretly filmed on the M60 in Greater Manchester, the man's book was spotted resting on the lorry's steering wheel.
He was given a fixed penalty notice as part of a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) drive against dangerous driving.
He was one of 71 motorists stopped for traffic offences - 50 for using mobile phones - by officers patrolling in an unmarked HGV cab fitted with cameras.
GMP said the elevated position of the cab allowed officers to see into other HGVs and smaller vehicles.
This enabled them to record offences including texting while driving and aggressive driving.
Of those stopped in Operation Tramline since 1 May, 66 were issued with tickets for driving without due care and attention.
One vehicle was also seized.
Insp Susan Redfern said: "I hope those people who have been issued with penalties take their punishments to heart and stop committing offences that are endangering the lives of other drivers."
She said there had been a range of reasons for stopping drivers but said the "most unbelievable" one was the lorry driver reading at the wheel.
