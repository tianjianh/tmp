Bristol RPZ: Some parking signs may need listed building consent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
English Heritage has told Bristol City Council it would be "prudent" to apply for listed building consent for some of its parking signs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Earlier this year, signs for the Clifton Village residents' parking zone appeared but some were fixed to railings which are Grade II* listed.
It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area.
The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement.
It said it "met regularly" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation.
The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making "significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable".
English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the "potential cumulative impact" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings.
"We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act," it said.
"In our view, it would be prudent to seek a listed building consent... to allow for a careful consideration of the impact of the works on the special interest of the terrace, of the number of signs and the consideration of alternative locations."
Numbers one to 31 Caledonia Place and their attached basement railings are Grade II* listed by English Heritage for their "special architectural or historic interest".
