[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greater Manchester Police detained 15 men and three women in the operation, which involved more than 200 officers.
Search warrants were executed at 22 properties in Eccles and Pendleton. Those arrested were held on suspicion of supplying drugs across Salford.
The raids were planned before the shooting of a seven-year-old boy in Eccles on Thursday, police said.
Detectives believe that attack was linked to feuds between rival gangs.
During the drugs raids, searches uncovered a cannabis farm, cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin, cannabis, a stolen motorbike and cash.
Supt Mark Kenny thanked the public for coming forward with information to help the investigation, but added: "There is still more to do and, as with any fight against organised crime groups embedded in our communities, we need residents to come to us with information so we can put a stop to this criminality."
