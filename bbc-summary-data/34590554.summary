Fishlock, 28, was left out of manager Jayne Ludlow's first squad in February 2015 and was replaced as captain.
Despite her commitments with Seattle Reign in National Women's Soccer League, Fishlock wants to continue with Wales.
"If I'm fit to play for my club I can travel to play for my country," she said.
Fishlock, who has won 87 caps since making her senior debut in 2006, will join Melbourne City on loan as player-coach during Seattle's off-season.
She expressed disappointment after being left out of the Wales squad for February's Istria Cup tournament in Croatia but returned for back-to-back friendlies against Slovakia in April.
The former Bristol Academy player is in Wales' squad for Friday's Euro 2017 qualifier in Norway but says she was close to retiring from the international stage.
"I was umming and ahhing this year after the World Cup whether it was time to just focus on my club career and prolong that a little bit," Fishlock added.
"There's no doubt that the flights will shorten my career, because that's what it does.
"I sat down and spoke with my family and I don't think I'd be ok with myself knowing that I could play for a club and choose not to play for my country."
