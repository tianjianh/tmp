Police said the first woman was found seriously injured at a house on Mapleton Crescent in Redcar at about 20:45 GMT on Wednesday.
A short time later officers received reports that a second woman was being attacked in nearby Byland Close.
Both women subsequently died, said a spokesman for Cleveland Police who have now arrested a 34-year-old man on suspicion of two counts of murder.
