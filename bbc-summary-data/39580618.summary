Gwent Police Chief Constable Jeff Farrar to retire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief constable of Gwent Police is to retire this summer after 35 years of policing, it has been announced.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeff Farrar will stand down at the end of June after four years as head of the force.
The Police and Crime Commissioner for Gwent (PCC) Jeff Cuthbert said a search for his successor would begin as soon as possible.
Mr Farrar said the new chief constable would be inheriting a "more effective and efficient force".
During his tenure, Mr Farrar has had to make Â£42m in efficiency savings because of budget cuts.
He has also overseen the improvement of the force, which has gone from being rated as "requiring improvement" by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to ranking as "good".
Mr Farrar, who started his career at South Wales Police, has planned and commanded some of the most high profile events in the UK in recent years, including the 2014 Nato Summit in Newport, golf's 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor and two FA Cup and League Cup football finals.
He was appointed as Gwent Police's chief constable in November 2013 after carrying out the role in a temporary capacity and in 2014, he was awarded the Queens Police Medal in the Birthday Honours list.
Mr Farrar said he had been proud to serve in the police for the last 35 years.
"The last four years have presented countless challenges but I am confident that my successor will inherit a more effective and efficient force," he added.
Mr Cuthbert said Mr Farrar would be a "hard act" for the next chief constable to follow.
"He has done a fantastic job and has shown that he is a strong leader who has the support of officers, staff as well as our partners in the community," he said.
"I am confident that he will continue to play a leading role in public life, but in a different capacity."
Mr Farrar last week helped mark the 50th anniversary of Gwent Police and said he believed the force would rely more on technology to help policing in the future amid budget and job cuts.
