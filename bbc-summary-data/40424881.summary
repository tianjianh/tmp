[SN]TITLE[SN]
Law to tax fly-tippers in Wales passed by assembly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fly-tippers will be charged twice for illegally dumping waste in Wales after a new law was passed by the assembly.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Landfill Disposals Tax will come into force from April 2018 when power is devolved from Westminster.
Fly-tippers can already be fined and prosecuted but will also face a tax on what they dump under the new legislation.
The Welsh Government said it would "strengthen the financial deterrent" of fly-tipping.
Cleaning-up after fly-tippers in Wales cost an estimated Â£2.1m in 2015-16, according to official figures.
The measure is part of the Landfill Disposals Tax Bill passed by the assembly on Tuesday.
The new Wales-only charge will replace the current landfill tax in 2018.
The legislation broadly mirrors the current tax, which is charged on disposals of waste at authorised landfill sites, but introduces a tax on illegal waste dumping, including unauthorised sites and fly-tipping.
