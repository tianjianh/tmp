[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency numbers were down and the coastguard lost all radio and telephone links between the mainland for almost five hours.
NHS Shetland had earlier advised anyone needing medical attention to make their way to the hospital in Lerwick.
Flights were delayed and cancelled at Sumburgh Airport.
Services were restored shortly before 17:00.
BT said the problems were caused by "blown rectifiers and fuses" at the Wideford Hill radio transmitter on Orkney.
A spokesman said 2,600 telephone customers and 388 broadband customers had been affected.
A total of eleven flights were cancelled at Sumburgh and one was diverted to Kirkwall.
Highlands and Islands Airports Limited advised passengers to contact their airlines for further information.
Shetland MSP Tavish Scott has called for an "urgent investigation" into why radio communications and telephone links failed.
