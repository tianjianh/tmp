Fury, who is unbeaten in 24 fights, successfully defended his European heavyweight title in London in March.
Klitschko, 39, is WBA, IBF and WBO champion and has not lost for 11 years.
Fury, 26, said on Twitter he could not wait for what would be the "best fight in heavyweight history" and added he would knock out Klitschko.
The fight will be a record-breaking 28th heavyweight title bout for Klitschko and his 19th defence in his second reign as world champion.
Speaking after he beat Bryant Jennings in his last fight in April, he said he was "ready" for Fury.
The 6ft 9in Manchester fighter beat Romania's Christian Hammer in his most recent contest.
