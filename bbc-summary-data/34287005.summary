It was a 2,200km (1367 miles) journey over 24 hours but Asali the giraffe has finally returned home to Adelaide.

After a failed "rendezvous" in a Perth zoo, the female giraffe this week crossed Australia's harsh Nullarbor Plain in a purpose-built truck.
Six months of meticulous planning included raising power lines to ensure her safety.
She was returned to Adelaide's Monarto Zoo after sparks failed to fly with her male breeding partner Armani in Perth.
The eight-year-old female arrived back at Monarto Zoo "nice and calm", late Thursday, keeper Mark Mills told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Asali will spend four weeks in quarantine before she joins the rest of the female herd.
Perth Zoo now awaits the arrival of another female it hopes will mate with Armani, Perth Zoo curator John Lemon said in a statement.
"We hope to have another girl in the group within the next 12 months and hear the pitter-patter of baby giraffe hoofs in the near future," Mr Lemon said.
He said Asali should have been familiar with the long journey because she was born at Monarto Zoo, and it would be interesting to discover if she realised she was heading home.
