Police said his death was currently being treated as unexplained but not suspicious.
Mr West, who came from the north of England, is believed to have been found in toilets at the Strathallan Castle site in Auchterarder on Saturday.
A spokesman for the festival said: "We are extremely saddened by this news, and our thoughts are with the family."
He said the organisers were helping police with their inquiries.
Officers are also making inquiries into a video which appears to show an assault taking place at the campsite and have appealed for anyone with information to come forward "urgently".
Police Scotland said it had made 44 arrests since campsites opened on Thursday and the Scottish Ambulance Service reported 606 visits to the hospital tent, compared with 858 in 2014.
Organisers apologised after some of those attending the festival complained about waiting hours at the pick-up and drop-off areas.
Some cars had to be towed after becoming stuck in the mud at the new site on Saturday night.
The festival's director Geoff Ellis said: "A few things contributed to the delays.
"It's a brand new site and the weather wasn't kind to us on Saturday which led to a lot of people having to be towed from the west car park slowing us down because we don't have the benefit of 18 years of infrastructure that we did at Balado.
"We have continuously advised that there are no suitable pedestrian walkways in or out of the venue but over the last two nights, a high volume of people have done this anyway.
"This meant that the traffic coming in to the pick-up points could not access the event, causing tailbacks and increasing the numbers walking as they tried to meet their pick-ups further along the road."
He added: "We do apologise and we know that things should have been better than they were."
