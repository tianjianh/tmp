The New York Giants have released Josh Brown after new information relating to his arrest for domestic violence in 2015 was made public by authorities.

In the documents, Brown, 37, admits repeatedly abusing his ex-wife.
The Giants' decision came shortly after the player issued a statement insisting he had never hit her during the six-year period when he admits abuse.
Team president John Mara said the decision to retain him during the time since his arrest was "misguided".
"We believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh," a statement added.
"We hope that Josh will continue to dedicate himself to rehabilitation, and to becoming a better person and father.
"We will continue to support him in his efforts to continue counselling, and we hope that Josh and his family can find peace and a positive resolution."
Brown is one of the NFL's top kickers and scored a career-high 134 points last season.
After he was arrested last year, no charges were brought against him but a separate NFL investigation led to a one-game ban in September of this year.
The NFL has said it will reopen its investigation following the release of the new documents.
The NFL has toughened its domestic violence policy following criticism when Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice received only a two-game suspension in July 2014 for assaulting his then fiancee, now his wife.
He was later banned indefinitely when a video emerged of him punching his fiancee in the face but won an appeal against the punishment.
The new rules could lead to a six-game suspension or a lifetime ban for a second offence.
"I am sorry that my past has called into question the character or integrity of The New York Giants, Mr Mara or any of those who have supported me along the way.
"I have taken measures to get help so that I may be the voice of change, not a statistic. It is important to share that I never struck my wife, and never would.
"Abuse takes many forms, and is not a gray area. Through the past several years I have worked to identify and rectify my own behaviors.
"The road to rehabilitation is a journey and a constant modification of a way of life. My journey will continue forever as a person determined to leave a positive legacy and I embrace the opportunities to show and speak about what has helped me to be that man.
"In the interim, I am cooperating with the Giants and the NFL. Thank you to everyone that has supported me, I will not let you down."
