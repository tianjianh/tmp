The Italians, who came from 2-0 down to draw the first leg 2-2 at home, will also be without striker Paulo Dybala and midfielder Claudio Marchisio.
Bayern rested key players Arjen Robben and Robert Lewandowski at the weekend.
"We're aware of how strong Bayern are, but they also possess weak points," Juve defender Leonardo Bonucci said.
"We go to Munich full of enthusiasm and determination to reach the next round.
"No doubt about it, we started the first leg in completely the wrong fashion. It had nothing to do with what formation we were playing - we knew that we had to give more.
"We confronted one another face to face and took it upon ourselves to come out fighting and, from that point onwards, we saw the true Juventus once more."
The tie looked all but over after 55 minutes of the first leg in Turin after away goals from Thomas Muller and Robben put a dominant Bayern in control.
But Juventus, Champions League finalists last season, fought back in the second half and levelled through strikes from Dybala and Stefano Sturaro.
Both sides are chasing a treble this season, with Bayern five points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and Juventus three clear in Serie A.
"I know what will happen if we don't win the Champions League," said Bayern boss Pep Guardiola, who has been unable to win Europe's premier club competition in his two seasons with Bayern and who will leave them in the summer to take over at Manchester City.
"I have to live with the pressure. It's been like that for this club for the last 40 years: when we win, everyone is happy, when we don't, they are unhappy."
Of Juventus, the Spaniard added: "I know the Italian mentality and they have won a thousand titles with it - that's how it is."
