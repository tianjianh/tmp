Mrs Palin had cancelled an appearance at a campaign event for 2016 front-runner Donald Trump in Florida.
But she appeared at the event on Monday, citing "real life issues that happen" as a reason to back Mr Trump.
In January she endorsed the front-runner in the race to be Republican presidential candidate.
At the event, Mrs Palin addressed recent violent incidents at Trump rallies. She blamed the protesters, describing their actions as "punk-ass thuggery".
A statement from the Trump campaign described the accident as "bad" and said Mr Palin was in hospital.
A former governor of Alaska, Mrs Palin retired in favour of a media career, but remains an influential conservative voice.
On Tuesday, Republicans and Democrats vote in primaries in several states including Florida and Ohio.
Mrs Palin made appearances on Mr Trump's behalf at two events on Sunday.
"Governor Palin wishes her best to Mr Trump in the upcoming primaries," the Trump campaign said.
