The South Africa-born 23-year-old had been playing club cricket in the East Anglian Premier League this season.
"Sean shows a great maturity with the bat and understands his game well," Kent's high performance director Simon Willis told the club website.
"The number of runs he has scored in all formats is testament to his focus and concentration."
Dickson, who has a British mother and holds a UK passport, has previously played first-class cricket for Northerns in South Africa.
He also bowls medium pace and could make his first-team debut for the club in their T20 Blast match against Glamorgan on Friday.
Kent have not disclosed the length of his contract at the St Lawrence Ground.
