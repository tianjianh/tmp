Homes, the local shop and post office in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant were affected by the incident on Friday afternoon.
A pub landlord told BBC Wales the road around Market Square "was like a river".
United Utilities, which owns the pipe, is investigating the incident, which affected about 50 properties.
A spokesman said the flooding was due to a burst on one of the pipes that carries water from Lake Vyrnwy to treatment works in Oswestry.
"Our engineers are investigating and we are working closely with the fire service to assist those who have been flooded," he said
"We will be visiting the householders and businesses affected to assess the damage and explain the process for claiming for any losses and getting their homes back to normal as quickly as possible.
"We will be doing all we can to help."
Crews from Mid and West Fire and Rescue service pumped out one property after the pipe burst and Powys council provided sandbags.
The water main was isolated by Severn Trent.
