[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Salford Red Devils will let Rangi Chase, Harrison Hansen, Cory Paterson and Theo Fages leave the club at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England international Chase, 29, had been suspended pending an internal disciplinary investigation, but will now been given a free transfer.
Captain Hansen, 29, is also released while Salford owner Marwan Koukash says Paterson, 28, is moving to Leigh.
Half-back Fages had resigned from the club and will now be allowed to leave.
"We're very close with his advisers to reaching a deal and we want to wish him all the very best," Koukash said of 21-year-old Fages.
Salford secured their Super League status for next season with their win at Widnes and that will be the catalyst for their recruitment drive for next season, according to Koukash.
"Everything was on hold until we secured our position in Super League," he said. "Having done that now, it's a matter of finalising the deals.
"I have no doubt that there will be at least six to eight new arrivals."
