Strathbungo residents are being asked to take part in Window Wanderland at 18:00-21:00 on Saturday 25 February.
Artist Lucy Reeves, who ran her first event in Bristol in 2015, said it helped bring out people's playful side.
Previous events have seen windows with paper silhouettes, laser projections and people staging performances.
The event aims to encourage people to come outdoors for an evening walk around the neighbourhood.
Ms Reeves said: "I wanted to make an event that anyone can participate in, is easy to do, and creates something different.
"This brightens up the long winter nights giving everyone a great excuse to get outdoors.
"We have had displays made by schools, grandparents, even pets, some are silly, some are serious.
"It is a proper community event, some roads had almost every house participating, using campervans, top floor windows and even decorating hedges with lights."
Residents are being encouraged to sign up on the event's Facebook page or website.
Following the Bristol trail, seven areas in the UK ran an event in 2016, with a further 11 planned this year.
