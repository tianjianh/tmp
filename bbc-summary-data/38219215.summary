Michael John Dix, 27, died in a crash on the A4074 near Ipsden at about 00:00 GMT on 29 November.
His family said he was "a man who will be sorely missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him".
An 18-year-old Wallingford man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death dangerous driving and drink driving.
A family statement said: "Mike was a devoted and loving husband to Steph, doting father to their beautiful son Tommy aged three, and a loving son and brother.
"Mike, born in Swindon and raised in Marlborough and Didcot, was known to many of his friends as 'Ped-boy' due to his love of mopeds, which he customised in his own unique style.
"All of his family are struggling to come to terms with the sudden and far too early loss of a man who will be sorely missed by everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him.
"Mike, we may no longer be able to hug and hold you, however nothing can extinguish your bright star shining down upon us. The love we all have for you will always remain in our hearts."
Police said an orange Scania HGV, a silver Vauxhall Corsa and a Yamaha motorcycle were involved in the crash.
