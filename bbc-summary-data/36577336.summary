[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sidonio Teixeira, who died at HMP Long Lartin near Evesham, was serving a life sentence for murdering his three-year-old daughter in 2007 and trying to kill his son, aged nine.
A prisoner in his 60s was arrested.
The Prison Officers' Association said it was the 11th suspicious prison death in England and Wales in the last 20 months.
West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to a "medical emergency" and crews found a man in cardiac arrest when they arrived.
An ambulance service spokesman said: "Crews immediately commenced advanced life support but unfortunately it became apparent nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed dead at the scene."
Det Insp Paul Hardman, from West Mercia Police, said a "thorough and robust investigation" had been launched.
"These enquiries are in the early stages so we are unable to provide more information at this time," he said.
