Estate agent receives suspended sentence after £157k fraud

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An estate agent who defrauded clients and family out of £157,000 has been given a suspended prison sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Russell Baker, 59, formerly of Green Lane in Islington, was sentenced to 20 months in prison suspended for two years.
He was also ordered to complete 160 hours of unpaid community service.
Exeter Crown Court heard how Baker, who had previously pleaded guilty to nine counts of fraud, "robbed Peter to pay Paul", but never repaid any of them.
Recorder Mr Noel Casey described one count of fraud - where Baker had pocketed a pre-contract deposit that had been paid for a property - as "more egregious" than others, as it could have endangered the purchase of a house.
Baker created a web of limited companies, through which he operated an estate agents called Ashby's in Fore Street, Bovey Tracey, which has since been bought by a separate firm.
Investigators found a number of friends and acquaintances that Baker had approached claiming he needed money to help his business through a difficult period.
Baker promised high rates of return and a written "contract" but investors were ultimately left with nothing.
"This was a course of conduct conducted over six months and it was therefore sustained. It came on the back of you taking out loans and borrowing money to keep the business going, so by this time there was no prospect of repaying them", Mr Casey told Baker.
Wendy Spiegel was a client who fell victim to Baker's crimes. She said she lent him £25,000 to buy out his partner, but is yet to receive any money back.
"I really feel stupid. I really feel that I was gullible, and good-heartedly said I'd lend him the money. In retrospect it was a very stupid thing to have done", she said
