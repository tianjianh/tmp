El Sherbini, who became the first Egyptian and the youngest player ever to win the world title last year, won 11-8 11-9 11-9 in El Gouna.
"I'm over the moon," the 21-year-old told the PSA.
"Two or three months ago I wouldn't have imagined I would have won because I haven't won a title this season."
England's Laura Massaro fell short in her attempt to win a second world title, losing to El Welily in the quarter-finals.
