[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zabed Shah attacked the girl after he and another man, Abdul Latif, took her to a hotel in Manchester last December.
The teenager contacted police, and officers arrested the men a week later after finding them at the same hotel with two other girls, aged 15 and 16.
Shah and Latif were sentenced to 36 and 27 months respectively at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
Shah, 27, of of Hancock Close, Oldham, admitted a sexual assault on a child, attempting to pay for the sexual services of a child and supplying class A drugs.
Latif, 20, of Oundle Close, Oldham, admitted supplying class A drugs.
Shah must also sign the sex offenders register for 10 years.
PC Andy Barratt, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "Shah preyed on vulnerable young girls, fuelling them with drink and drugs before trying to sexually exploit them, whilst Latif encouraged his behaviour and stood by and watched.
"Both men deserve the sentences they were handed and I hope the people of Oldham now feel safer knowing these despicable men are off the streets."
