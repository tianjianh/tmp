Man gave 'thumbs up' before being crushed by tree

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has told an inquiry how a friend gave him the thumbs up seconds before he was crushed by a falling tree.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Phillips died aged 29 on land in Angus owned by the family of his life-long friend, David Cochrane.
Mr Phillips and Mr Cochrane were felling trees beside a road at Auchindorie Farm, near Kirriemuir, when the incident occurred on 14 March 2013.
A determination in the fatal accident inquiry will be published in the next two weeks.
Mr Cochrane told the inquiry at Forfar Sheriff Court that he had been operating a Caterpillar Telehandler machine which was attached to the trees they were cutting by a wire.
Mr Phillips, who worked as a tree cutter, used a chainsaw to cut the trees down.
The inquiry heard Mr Phillips was only trained to cut trees up to 380mm (15in) wide - but that the tree he was working on was 1,100mm (43in) wide.
However, a Forestry Commission expert said he had been using the correct tools and techniques.
The expert told the court the tree had fallen in an unexpected direction, landing directly on top of Mr Phillips, because a "hinge" piece of wood had been "compromised" during cutting.
Mr Cochrane, 32, said he had known Mr Phillips since childhood and their families had been friends for years.
Speaking of the moment his friend was killed, Mr Cochrane said: "The wire rope was attached to the tree quite high up.
"I was in the telehandler, which was attached to the other end of the wire, around 60 metres [197ft] away. He gave me the thumbs up and I began to move to pull the tree down towards me.
"Instead of coming towards me the tree broke away from the stump and fell the wrong way. There was no going back once it broke off - there's nothing you can really do and it could have fallen in any direction."
Mr Cochrane told the court that once the tree had broken Mr Phillips had tried to run away to get himself clear, but the tree had landed on top of him.
"I detached the rope and drove the Telehandler over and used it to lift the tree clear of John," he said.
"I was shouting to see if I got a response but when I got to him there was no pulse. I could see by the damage caused by the tree that there was nothing I could have done."
Sheriff Gregor Murray said he would give a written determination in the next two weeks.
He said: "These inquiries are not here to establish blame but to try to learn from it for the future if we can.
"It is clear from the evidence that this was a genuine tragedy which I don't think anything beyond Mr Phillips' actions could control."
