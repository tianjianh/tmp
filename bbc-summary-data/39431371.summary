Archaeologists started working on the Pocklington site in 2014 and have excavated more than 75 burial graves, known as barrows.
They described the latest find as "highly unusual".
Other finds include human skeletons, including a "young warrior", swords, spears and shields.
Those working at the excavation site said current investigations were looking into how the chariot and horses might be linked to human burials.
They said further testing and analysis was expected to reveal more information.
Paula Ware, from MAP Archaeological Practice, said the latest find could help shed more light on the ritual of Iron Age burial.
She said the proximity of the horse skeletons to the chariot suggested the animals played a crucial role in the burial ceremony.
Ms Ware added that the "rare discovery" would widen understanding of the Arras culture - a group of people who lived in the region at the time.
