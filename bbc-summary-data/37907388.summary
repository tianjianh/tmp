The group appeared to give Williams his Brits Icon award and joined him for a rendition of their hits Back For Good and The Flood.
"Rob, whether you like it or not, you will always be a member of Take That," said Howard Donald.
The concert - in honour of Williams' Brit Award - was filmed by ITV and will be screened at a later date.
The star is only the third artist to receive the Icon award after David Bowie and Elton John. He previously won the Brits' lifetime achievement accolade in 2010.
A Take That reunion has been rumoured for months, as 2017 marks the 25th anniversary of their debut album Take That and Party. However, last week Williams told the BBC there was nothing planned.
"We unfortunately couldn't get our diaries to match," he said. "We will be doing something but I don't think it'll be next year."
Williams left the group in 1995 to embark on a solo career. The rest of the band, including fifth member Jason Orange, got back together in 2006, before Orange left in 2014.
Williams also rejoined the band in 2010 for the Progress album and tour.
The singer is expected to reach number one this week with his latest solo album, The Heavy Entertainment Show.
His Brits show, at the Troxy in London, featured several songs from the new release, alongside the hits No Regrets, Kids and a cover of Lorde's Royals, which he dedicated to "my mate Olly Murs".
The star also brought out his father Peter to duet on the song Better Man.
