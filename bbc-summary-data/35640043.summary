[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Senior executives from the metals and mining company Rio Tinto have been visiting Scotland to discuss a review of the firm's assets in the country.

Concerns have been raised about the future of about 150 jobs at Rio Tinto's aluminium smelter at Fort William in Lochaber.
The review includes operations at the plant.
In Scotland, the company also owns more than 100,000 acres (40,468 ha) of land and two large hydro electric schemes.
Among those who met with the executives were members of the Scottish Parliament, including Highlands and Islands MSP John Finnie, who asked the company not to underestimate the impact of job losses on Lochaber.
Labour MSPs Rhoda Grant and David Stewart have set up a meeting with officials from Rio Tinto for Wednesday.
