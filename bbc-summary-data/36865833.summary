[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Captain Jean-Francois Perreault and Imran Zafar Syed were arrested before they took control of the Air Transat flight bound for Toronto on Monday.
The airline said it had carried out an internal probe and suspended the pair.
The pilots face charges of being under the influence of alcohol and threatening behaviour.
The flight was delayed until Tuesday morning
In a statement, Transat said: "The issue is a complex one and because the matter is the subject of judicial proceedings the airline will not comment at this point.
"Both pilots have received an administrative suspension for the duration of the carrier's internal investigation."
Air Transat president Jean-Francois Lemay said: "Canadian and European rules and regulations regarding alcohol consumption are very strict.
"Our own internal rules are even more stringent and we do not tolerate any failure to comply."
Perreault, 39, and Syed, 37,  who are both Canadian, appeared at Paisley Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
They were remanded in custody until their next court appearance.
The delayed Airbus A310 flight eventually set off on Tuesday morning with about 250 passengers having spent the night at nearby hotels.
Mr Lemay confirmed passengers would be compensated about Â£500 for the inconvenience they had suffered.
