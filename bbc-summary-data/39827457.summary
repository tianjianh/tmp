Kilmarnock 2-1 Inverness Caledonian Thistle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock secured their own Scottish Premiership status as they thrust Inverness Caledonian Thistle deeper into relegation trouble.

Sean Longstaff and Jordan Jones scored the goals that moved Killie to seventh.
Alex Fisher's late consolation was not enough to prevent Inverness being left four points adrift of Hamilton at the bottom with two games to play.
The best Richie Foran's side can now hope for is a place in the play-off final against Falkirk or Dundee United.
Caley Thistle began brightly and almost took the lead after two minutes. Fisher was through on goal, but he could only find the side netting with his shot.
The tension was clear to see as both groups of players came together to shout the odds following a tough challenge by Iain Wilson on Ross Draper. Referee John Beaton managed to keep the peace, showing yellow cards to Wilson, his captain, Steven Smith, and Caley Thistle's Brad McKay.
Then came a hammer blow for Inverness as goalkeeper Ryan Esson failed to hold a high ball and it fell to Longstaff at the edge of the box. The on-loan Newcastle United midfielder fired in a low shot that took a deflection before nestling into the back of the net.
Caley Thistle boss Foran replaced Jake Mulroney with Iain Vigurs at half-time in search of some kind of reaction.
However, Kilmarnock continued to look the more likely winners and they hammered that point home with a moment of real quality from Jones. The winger left the Inverness defence trailing in his wake as he homed in on goal before dispatching the perfect finish past Esson.
Just as it looked like all hope was gone for Caley Thistle, though, they pulled a goal back. Greg Tansey's pass sliced through the Kilmarnock defence and Fisher was alive to the opportunity, sliding the ball past MacDonald.
All three previous meetings between the sides this season had ended as 1-1 draws, but there was to be no late equaliser and Caley Thistle's run without an away win was extended to 13 games.
Billy Mckay came closest with a lob just wide over goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald, but Kilmarnock held on to end their run of six home games without a win.
Kilmarnock, conversely, are safe for another season, meaning thoughts turn to what happens with Lee McCulloch. Will the interim manager be given the job on a permanent basis? It is surely a no-brainer.
It is a different story in terms of the Inverness dugout. For Foran, a week of angst looms large and the odds are heavily stacked against him and his side.
Inverness can still survive this season, but the arithmetic remains against them and confidence in the camp must be at a very low ebb.
Kilmarnock interim boss Lee McCulloch: "The way we played today was outstanding. Last week I said we were not at it. Today I knew we were. There was a feeling in the dressing room, a togetherness that was brilliant.
"The last 10 minutes were a bit nervy but we got there in the end. To have finally got there [Premiership survival] with two games remaining, I am just delighted for everybody in the dressing room and everyone at the club. Another year, we continue to strive to get better.
[On his future] "I have said for the last couple of months, if we get safe then it will be a two-way conversation. I think that will happen, but I don't know if it will happen this week or next week. That is really all I can say until I speak to the board of directors. We just want to enjoy today."
Inverness boss Richie Foran: "I'm delighted with the players' performance, believe it or not. I told them they should be proud of themselves, how they handled the occasion.
"Individual mistakes have cost us again. The only disappointing part is the second goal. Jones has so much space to run at us. It's a set-piece for us, they break and score - that's schoolboy defending but overall we were the far better team and had far better chances.
"We didn't get what we deserved and that was the three points, in my mind. We need to cut out the individual mistakes, it's been the story of the season.
"We need help from other clubs now, simple as that. We need to do our business on Wednesday and Saturday. There is still a chance. It is probably a small chance, but there is a chance."
