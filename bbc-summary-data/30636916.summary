A town pastor, who helps those in need on the streets of Bury St Edmunds at night, is among those recognised in the New Year's Honours list.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jo Copsey, 56, works as a volunteer patrolling the town centre on Friday and Saturday nights.
She has been awarded the British Empire Medal for services to community safety.
"It's a very practical way of showing the love of Jesus to people when they're having their night out," she said.
Ms Copsey has been a town pastor since 2009 and co-ordinates a team of 35 Christians in Bury St Edmunds.
Bob Pegnall also receives a British Empire Medal for his work as church organist and choir director at St Mary's in Woodbridge.
Mr Pegnall, a maths teacher who worked at Copleston High in Ipswich from 1974 to 2011, said: "I enjoy doing what I do, and have done it for 38 years, and don't regard it as particularly meritorious, but I'm glad that it has obviously been well received, at least by some."
Roger Wright has been appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to music in his current job as chief executive of Aldeburgh Music and previous posts including director of the BBC Proms and controller of BBC Radio Three.
He said: "Not only is it recognition of the unique value and importance of music and the arts in all our lives, it is also a huge tribute to my colleagues both past and present, who brilliantly bring so many performances to fruition and make them accessible for everyone."
The former Lord Lieutenant of Suffolk, Lord Tollemache, has been made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).
