Sayes Court will double in size and provide an additional 210 places by September 2015.
Surrey County Council said it needs to "bridge a Â£215m funding gap" for 13,000 places, blaming an "unprecedented demand" on its services.
It said nearby Esher School is also being completely rebuilt to boost capacity by 210 places.
