Confusion at four speed signs in Plymouth road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers are being bamboozled by speed signs showing conflicting messages.

The signs state maximum 20mph and 30mph as drivers enter Austin Avenue in Plymouth - and as they exit, the speed signs are reversed.
Daniel Barlow, who lives nearby, said: "It's absolutely ridiculous, I'm flabbergasted because people still do 60mph down here."
Plymouth City Council, which is in charge of the signage, was not available for comment.

Austin Avenue was one of a number of roads in Plymouth where speed has been cut to 20mph maximum.
Lorraine Couling, who works in a shop on the corner of the road, said the signs had appeared in the last few weeks.
"They are are very confusing," she said. "You are not sure if you have to do a 30 out or 30 in, or 20 in or 20 out. It's bonkers."
One woman walking her children to school: "People drive quite slowly down here when they see I have children with me, but the signs make no sense at all.
"I feel sorry for the drivers because one minute they're told its 20 and the next it's 30."
