RBS offers £15,000 reward over Dumbarton branch robbery

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Royal Bank of Scotland has offered a £15,000 reward to help trace a man who carried out an armed robbery at a branch in Dumbarton last week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man threatened staff with a knife at the branch on High Street at about 09:30 on 17 June before making off with a four-figure sum of cash.
He was wearing a dark jacket with the hood up and a balaclava.
Police said an operation at the scene on Wednesday, which saw them question people one week on, was "worthwhile".
Officers stopped pedestrians and drivers and showed them CCTV images of a man they want to speak to.
Det Sgt Stuart Gillies said: "Yesterday's revisit to the scene was definitely worthwhile and we spoke to members of the public in the surrounding area in an attempt to gather more information about this incident.
"Our inquiries are at an early stage and I would continue to appeal to anyone who knows who is responsible to come forward.
"Somebody knows who committed this crime and we understand that RBS are offering a significant financial reward for any information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the person responsible."
