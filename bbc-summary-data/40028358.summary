Soviet-era tin cans among rubbish found near Ullapool

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tin cans from Soviet-era fish factory ships have been found among rubbish cleared from two shorelines in the north west Highlands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 300 bags of rubbish were gathered during the beach cleans at Dun Canna, north of Ullapool.
The tins were from factory ships, known as klondykers, which would anchor in Loch Broom off Ullapool to process mackerel in the 1970s to early 90s.
Almost 50 volunteers were involved in collecting the rubbish.
The effort was part of the Scottish Wildlife Trust's Living Seas project.
