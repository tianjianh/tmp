Family 'disgusted' over crash delay

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police Scotland is facing criticism after it took three days for officers to investigate a crashed car that had a dead man and critically injured woman inside.

John Yuill, 28, and Lamara Bell, 25, were found in a blue Renault Clio just off the M9 near Stirling on Wednesday.
The force later admitted they had been told about the crash on Sunday morning.
Ms Bell's family has told BBC Scotland they were angry and disgusted by the police's handling of the case.
They said Ms Bell was in a medically induced coma in hospital after suffering broken bones and kidney damage which was caused by dehydration.
Doctors at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow have described her condition as "critical".
Mr Yuill's father, Gordon Yuill, has told the Daily Record newspaper that his son's injuries were so severe that he would have died on impact after the Clio left the motorway and plunged down a tree-lined embankment.
But Andrew Bell, the father of Lamara, told STV News his daughter was conscious when found and had been speaking to firefighters.
He added: "She thought she had been there for 30 minutes."
Mr Bell also revealed that on Sunday morning he had unknowingly driven by the spot where his daughter was later found.
He added: "I went past the crash, not even 100 yards away from her. If anything happens I've got to tell myself that."
Mr Yuill and Ms Bell both had children of their own.
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson, who was speaking as the MSP for Falkirk West, said he wanted "early answers" about the tragedy, and that Police Scotland had assured him all relevant information would be passed on to investigators.
He told BBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programme: "My understanding is that it appears that this car has come off the road at some point on Sunday and that a call was made to Police Scotland.
"And the call handler for some reason noted that information, but a crew was not dispatched to investigate the issue.
Mr Matheson added: "It's understandable that the families have many questions they want answers to. I want answers too on their behalf. Why was a crew not dispatched at the time when the initial call was received? Even then, why was there a gap of several days before police then investigated?
"I'm keen to ensure that this investigation is taken forward in a quick and very swift way."
Police could be seen on Thursday afternoon searching the area where the couple's car had eventually been found.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is looking into the case, but there have been calls for a wider inquiry, with several politicians saying Police Scotland had serious questions to answer.
There had been an ongoing search for the couple in the area earlier this week, with police circulating photographs of the couple and their car after their families reported them missing on Sunday.
They had last been seen leaving Loch Earn in Stirlingshire in the early hours of Sunday morning.
A Pirc spokesman said the investigation into why the telephone call made to Police Scotland later that day, which reported their car was off the road, was not followed up.
He added: "The commissioner's investigation will also examine the robustness of Police Scotland's missing person inquiry and look at why that inquiry was not linked with the information received in the call."
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the government should review whether a "wider independent investigation" should be held, saying the couple had been "failed" by police.
He said: "Everyone agrees that a three day delay between the initial call to the control room and finding the couple is unacceptable and we need to establish why this happened.
"I know police officers have been deeply affected by this case. There is great upset within the force, and it is of such importance that serious questions must be answered.
"It is right that the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner is investigating the matter but that may not be enough - a wider independent investigation may be required."
Scottish Labour MSP Elaine Murray said: "Local Police control rooms across Scotland have been closed and the effectiveness of the 101 service has been called into question. It is essential that the Pirc inquiry investigates whether the new call centre arrangements led to the report of this tragic accident not being followed up."
Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser also said the "truly shocking incident" must be investigated in depth.
He added: "People lying unattended at the side of the road for days is something you'd be surprised to encounter in the third world."
