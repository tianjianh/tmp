[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mental health voting ban could be lifted in Guernsey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Guernsey law that stops adults with mental health conditions from voting could be scrapped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The island is the only jurisdiction in the British Isles which stops people with certain disabilities from voting.
States members will vote on the proposal to abolish the "legal disability" clause next week in time for next year's election.
The Guernsey Disability Alliance (GDA) has welcomed the move.
At present people "who are certified as being of unsound mind; subject to guardianship; or detained in an institution as persons in need of treatment for a mental ailment" are not entitled to vote.
Alliance chair Shelaine Green said: "Taking away someone's right to vote is a serious matter, voting is fundamental to our democracy.
"People who have a legal guardian may simply need help to manage one part of their lives, like their finances.
"Someone in hospital recovering from severe depression could still want a postal vote. We hope our deputies will agree with the proposals and get rid of a restriction that should have been lifted years ago."
The proposals also include scrapping the "legal disability" restriction for people wanting to stand as a deputy.
