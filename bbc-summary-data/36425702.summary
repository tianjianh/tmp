Pupils 'feel unsafe at Worle Community School'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pupils are feeling unsafe at a school because staff are not tackling bullying and poor behaviour, a report found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after a pupil was attacked with a knife at Worle Community School in March, followed by head teacher Peter Binding being given leave with no stated return date.
The school in Weston-super-Mare - rated inadequate - also has areas pupils feel are no-go zones and high truancy rates.
North Somerset Council said the school will be run by an academy to improve.
The report said: "There are some areas of the school site where pupils say they do not feel safe, and as a result they stay in central areas at break - and lunchtime.
"This is because at these times some areas, particularly the school field, are dominated by groups of mainly boys, who are confrontational and do not respond quickly when challenged by staff."
Inspectors were also concerned about "inadequate" progress in maths and low expectations of some disabled, special educational needs and disadvantaged pupils.
School governors were also criticised for failing to hold the school's leaders to account.
Several points were made to address the issue, through calling in the local authority to review safeguarding, train and support teachers to deal with poor behaviour and "rapidly raise achievement" particularly in maths, for special needs and disadvantaged pupils.
The council said it was aware of the problems there, but the rate of progress was "not fast enough".
The school will be managed by North Somerset Priory Community School, an outstanding Academy Trust (PCSA) from Monday.
PCSA's head teacher, Neville Coles said he wanted to address "key areas" and get a more supportive environment in place, with "respect and courtesy" at the forefront.
Jeans and trainers are also being banned, in favour of a "spot-on" uniform.
The school has been rated as good in its previous June 2014 inspection.
