Cowell launched the series in 2002, and stuck around for eight years before launching the US version of X Factor.
He recalled "great times" with his co-stars Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul, adding they had "found some amazing artists" together.
The final season will be broadcast in 2016, US TV network Fox has said.
The show's host Ryan Seacrest also reacted to the cancellation, tweeting: "This show's been a big part of my life for so long... hard to imagine it without it."
He added: "Next season will be emotional yes, but next season will be unforgettable. I can't wait #idol."
Cowell later added to his official statement with a tweet: "Looking back at my time on American Idol we had a great time. We found great artists. Had fun. And to America. Thank you. It was a blast."
Fox said the last season would act as a "celebratory event" paying tribute to former contestants, winners and fans.
Current judges Jennifer Lopez, Harry Connick Jr and Keith Urban will all return, along with Seacrest.
The show, created by music mogul Simon Fuller, paved the way for a wealth of TV talent contests including The X Factor and The Voice.
It launched the singing careers of inaugural winner Kelly Clarkson and stars such as Jennifer Hudson and Adam Lambert.
The show's celebrity judges have included Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj, Steven Tyler, Kara DioGuardi and Ellen DeGeneres.
The singing competition drew 36 million viewers in its heyday in 2006, but ratings for the most recent season have dipped to 11.6 million viewers.
