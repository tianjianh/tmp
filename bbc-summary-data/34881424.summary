David Cowling, 76, committed the offences while he was the head teacher at Balnacraig School in Perth.
The court was told his relationship with one victim was so blatant he was forced to resign, but it was not reported as a crime for four decades.
The sheriff told Cowling he had "abused the trust" of vulnerable children.
Cowling admitted he had been involved in a sexual relationship with one of his pupils, but claimed that nothing of a sexual nature had taken place with her before she was 16.
He also admitted taking her to a hotel for the weekend of her 16th birthday.
However, the jury at Perth Sheriff Court unanimously found the former head teacher guilty of grooming the girl and becoming involved in a sexual relationship with her before she turned 13.
The woman, now in her 50s, said Cowling had sexually abused her at various locations, including a caravan which was parked in the school grounds.
Further incidents took place during trips to Glasgow and Arisaig in the early 1970s, the court was told.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said that she was made to feel special by Cowling and only realised it was wrong when she left the school.
His crimes came to light when a second woman, who is also now in her 50s, decided to report Cowling's attacks to police and a full investigation was launched.
Sheriff Lindsay Foulis told him: "At the time you were the headmaster of the establishment. The children under your control were put there because they were in the care system.
"They were vulnerable individuals. You were in a position of trust and undoubtedly you abused that trust.
"It is very clear your behaviour towards the complainers undoubtedly had an effect on their day-to-day lives from that time onwards."
Cowling, from Perth, was found guilty of two sex offence charges at the Perth residential school.
His counsel Lucy Keane said: "As a result of a mistake and a lack of judgment he has paid a high price for it."
