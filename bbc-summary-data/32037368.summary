Hallett, 29, has been the Championship side's top points scorer for each of the past three seasons.
Promising players Laurence May, also a stand-off, and prop Tyler Gendall, both aged 20, have also signed new deals.
"Kieran is a guy on top of the Championship outside-half tree," said director of rugby Ian Davies.
"Laurence and Tyler are both rewarded for cracking first seasons with us. All three have made significant contributions this season and I look forward to further helping them achieve their rugby ambitions."
May, who has been dual-registered with Exeter Chiefs during much of this season, has also played at full-back.
Gendall, a member of the club's Player Development Foundation, made a major impression early this season before suffering a knee injury. He is expected back to full fitness for the start of the 2015-16 campaign.
