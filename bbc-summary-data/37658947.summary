A former soldier has admitted buying deactivated guns over the internet and turned them back into lethal weapons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Andrew Steven, also known as Walton, set up a specialist workshop in his home in Ayr.
When it was searched by police in March 2015, they found a cache of guns, tools and ammunition.
Steven, 53, and three co-accused were remanded in custody before sentencing in November.
Dean Kimmins, also known as Stewart, 32, from Glasgow, Kenneth McMullen, 27, from Glasgow, and Michael Stuart, 35, from Glasgow, had denied the charges against them.
After a trial they were convicted for their part in the scheme to further the commission of serious organised crime by reactivating firearms.
The court heard that the accused were under surveillance and undercover police witnessed gun handovers.
It was also told that one of the guns reactivated by Steven - a Colt Model King Cobra revolver - was found near a murder scene in Scapa Street, Glasgow in 1993.
Other guns were uncovered during drugs raids.
Prosecutor Richard Goddard said: "Andrew Steven was the general reactivator and distributor, the gun dealer, Dean Kimmins was the customer sourcing guns, Michael Stuart the organiser and Kenneth McMullan, the courier."
