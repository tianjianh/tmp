Daniel Young, 30, was killed in Kendor Gardens at about 08:00 GMT as he was making his way to a new job.
Police said a 37-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder on Tuesday. He remains in custody at a south London police station.
Two other men who were held over the attack have been bailed.
Mr Young, originally from Paignton in Devon, was on the way to his second day working at Coventry University's London Campus International when he was attacked.
Police have called the killing a "senseless murder of a brilliant young man" without "a clear motive or reason".
Detectives said they are still investigating a second stabbing near Kendor Gardens on the same day when a 23-year-old man was stabbed in the buttocks.
However, a Scotland Yard spokesperson said the two attacks had "not been linked forensically or evidentially" yet.
Police have released CCTV footage showing Mr Young's last steps as he made his way to work.
They have appealed to anybody who was in in the vicinity at the time to contact them.
