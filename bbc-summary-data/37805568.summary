[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Antoine Maury, 21, was last seen on Monday at 22:30 after leaving friends at Edinburgh College's Milton Road East Campus.
Pascal and Laura Maury will be part of Saturday's search which will centre on the area of Holyrood Park.
Volunteers will meet at 11:00 in the car park at Holy Rood High School.
Insp Alan Carson, of Police Scotland's Edinburgh Division, said: "The response from the public since Antoine's disappearance has been fantastic.
"So many people have expressed a willingness to help find him as quickly as possible and I know that his family are extremely grateful for the support of the people of Edinburgh.
"Those who are intending to help with our search activity on Saturday are asked to wrap up warm and wear suitable clothing. We want to make sure that any activity is conducted in a co-ordinated and safe manner.
"Please also make sure that you have a fully-charged mobile phone with you and some snacks to help you throughout the day."
Mrs Maury issued an appeal to Antoine on Friday, urging him to come home and saying he was not in any trouble.
She called on people living in the area to check their outbuildings and garages.
Mrs Maury also appealed for information from anyone who may be sheltering her son.
Police said there was a possible sighting of a man matching Mr Maury's description near the Duddingston Village area of Holyrood Park, heading into the park, on Monday between 22:45 and 23:00.
The man was topless.
Laura and Pascal Maury said their son's disappearance was completely out of character.
Mrs Maury said her son was well liked and had been enjoying his studies in Scotland.
He has been a student at Edinburgh College for three months.
Ms Maury said: "We are desperate to find Antoine and are appealing to anyone who might have information as to where he is or know if someone is sheltering him.
"We want him to know that we love him, he is not in trouble and for him to come home.
"We ask that anyone living in the area to please check their outbuildings and garages again to confirm that Antoine is not hiding there.
"He is a very happy young man and there is no reason to believe my son would run away."
Mr Maury was described as white, of medium build, 6ft with short brown hair, a beard and has a bleeding hand tattoo on his forearm.
He has a good level of English, but was unfamiliar with Edinburgh.
He has lost his glasses and his eyesight is not very good.
