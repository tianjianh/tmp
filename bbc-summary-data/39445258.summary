It follows a BBC report that some girls were missing school because they could not afford sanitary protection.
Charity Freedom4Girls raised the issue after being contacted by a school in West Yorkshire.
The products will be delivered to schools as part of FareShare Leeds' distribution of food to school breakfast clubs.
It will be then up to the schools to distribute them to students.

Tina Leslie, from Freedom4Girls, which normally provides sanitary products to women in Africa, said the group had responded to a "call for action".
"We have been working since it came to light that there were girls, in Leeds and around the UK, who do not have access to sanitary products because they are either too poor to buy them or they just do not have access for whatever reason.
"We need sanitary protection for girls in schools so they do not miss out on their education."
She said although the campaign had started in Leeds it was a nationwide problem.
"This is just the tip of the iceberg."
The products have been donated by charities and supermarket chains.
