[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A jobs fair is being held on Teesside in a bid to help steel workers and contractors hit by the closure of the SSI plant find new employment.

The Thai-based owners have gone into liquidation, with the loss of 2,200 jobs at the Redcar site.
There have also been knock-on job losses at contractors and suppliers.
More than 30 employers are showcasing opportunities, with vacancies ranging from heavy industry to administration and logistics.
Sue Soroczan, from Durham and Tees Valley Jobcentre Plus, said: "We've had a fantastic response from companies in the area and beyond.
"They recognise that the SSI workforce have excellent skills that would be transferable to a range of jobs currently available."
