The Coen brothers are developing a TV version of their hit film Fargo for US cable channel FX, according to Deadline Hollywood.

Ethan and Joel Coen are executive producers on the project alongside writer Noah Hawley, who previously created The Unusuals and My Generation.
The 1996 film noir won two Oscars for best script and best actress.
The crime thriller starred Frances McDormand as a policewoman on the trail of two bumbling criminals.
The plot centred around a bungled blackmail attempt - after William H Macy's character, a slimy car salesman, hatched a plot to kidnap his wife and make his father-in-law pay a ransom.
Set in Minnesota, the film was notable for its heavily-pregnant protagonist and the sing-song dialogue, where almost every sentence ended "Yah?"
Recognised as modern auteurs, The Coen brothers' other films include No Country for Old Men, Miller's Crossing, The Big Lebowski and Brother, Where Art Thou?
They won a $1m (Â£617,000) international award last year for "a creative partnership unique in the history of film-making".
They were given the Dan David Prize - awarded to people who have made "an outstanding contribution to humanity" - at Tel Aviv University in Israel.
