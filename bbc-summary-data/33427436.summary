Man in court over 'naked toy shop attack' in Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man accused of running naked through a Dundee toy shop, abducting a six-year-old boy and hitting a woman with a cricket bat may not be fit to stand trial, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Przemyslaw Kaluzny faces a total of 13 charges over a series of alleged incidents in April.
The 41-year-old has not yet made a plea, and Dundee Sheriff Court heard psychiatric reports were being prepared on Kaluzny's sanity at the time.
The case was continued until next week.
Kaluzny is charged with first stealing a mobile phone and baseball flat from a neighbour's flat, on 5 April, before intentionally exposing his genitals to her.
He is then accused of stealing a car key before driving off in a Renault Laguna car from outside the Watson Street property, and driving to the Kingsway Retail Park without a licence or insurance, still with the bat, an offensive weapon, with him.
Prosecutors say he then went into the Toys R Us store and behaved in a threatening and abusive manner by removing his clothing, shouting, brandishing the bat, struggling violently with staff and customers and placing them in a state of fear and alarm.
Kaluzny is further accused of running through the store naked, before abducting a six-year-old boy by picking him up and taking him from the shop against his will. He then allegedly assaulted the boy's 67-year-old grandmother by hitting her on the head with a cricket bat, to her injury.
A final charge alleges that he wilfully destroyed property belonging to another by snapping the plastic casing and metal connecting bar of a pair of handcuffs while he was being taken to Dundee's police headquarters,
Nicola Brown, defending, said investigations were ongoing as to Kaluzny's sanity at the time and his fitness to stand trial.
She said a psychiatric report would be available by next week, and Sheriff Elizabeth Munro continued the case until then.
