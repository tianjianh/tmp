The men died while making a descent on Stob Coire nam Beith in Glen Coe on Saturday
Mr Davidson has been described as an "absolute legend" because of his climbing abilities.
Mr Smith, who was originally from Lancashire, was a member of Glencoe Mountain Rescue.
Their bodies were found by two other climbers.
Simon was an absolute legend. He was an incredible guy with a real passion for the outdoors."
Tim Hamlet, a mountaineer who knew both men, said they were experienced climbers and their deaths had shocked the climbing community.
He said: "Simon was an absolute legend. He was an incredible guy with a real passion for the outdoors.
"I also knew Joe. It is the nature of climbing that everyone knows everyone else."
Mr Hamlet added of Mr Davidson: "He was always smiling, always happy to be out in the mountains. Many fun times shared with this great man.
"His infectious personality seemed to rub off on everyone around him. You will be sorely missed my friend."
John Grieve, who has been involved with Glencoe MRT for 52 years, told BBC Scotland that it was the team's first climbing death in its own patch.
He said: "It has always been something I've dread - carrying one of our own off the hill."
Mr Grieve said the young climber had proved himself to be a skilful team member last summer when he made a careful search of difficult terrain for a missing hillwalker.
The veteran mountain rescuer added that his favourite memory of Mr Smith was of him doing DIY at his daughter's home.
Mr Grieve said: "My seven-year-old grandson could not wait to get home from school each day to help his new friend Joe who would give him a job taking nails out with a hammer."
Conditions on Saturday were good for climbing and the area the two men were in was not prone to avalanches, said Mr Grieve.
He added: "Both men were really experienced - fit and fast and at the top of their game."
Oliver Millington, a friend of Mr Smith's and also worked with him on new Fort William climbing walls project Three Wise Monkeys, said: "Yesterday, I, and a group of friends around me that I am very fond of lost a great friend, Joe Smith, in Glen Coe."
Mr Millington paid tribute to his friend's passion for climbing, which he did as often as he could while working on The Jacobite, a steam train that takes holidaymakers on west coast railway trips.
He said: "His climbing ability quickly surpassed mine, and he furiously ticked off climbs all over Scotland, making pretty much everything look horribly easy, usually with toes sticking out the end of his climbing shoes."
George McEwan, executive officer at Mountain Training Scotland, had Mr Davidson as a student on a Ben Nevis ice climbing course seven years ago.
He said: "I remember at the time being impressed by his super enthusiastic attitude for all things mountain and climbing related.
"It was also noticeable that he was also very talented as a climber. In the intervening years his tally of ascent of challenging climbs, both summer and winter, is impressive and would be the envy of many of a veteran climber."
Simon Yearsley, who climbed new routes with Mr Davidson in Glen Coe, described his friend as someone who was "super enthusiastic" about the Scottish winter climbing scene, but also as a person "quietly aware" of its risks.
He said: "The breadth of Simon's experience and what he liked to do included hard Scottish mixed winter climbs to going off into the Pyrenees.
"Simon was a rare breed. He was super enthusiastic but with a quite reserve."
Mr Yearsley added: "What we do is a relatively dangerous game. I know Simon was a very conscientious climber and whenever I climbed with him I always had a feeling of confidence about his climbing."
Police Scotland said the alarm was raised at 16:25.
A spokesman said: "Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team attended and recovered the men from the hill who had both sadly died.
"A report will be sent to the procurator fiscal. Members of the public and mountain rescue team are thanked for their efforts during this incident."
Following the incident on Saturday afternoon, a team involving Glencoe Mountain Rescue and the police recovered the bodies.
The leader of the mountain rescue team, Andy Nelson, said the men were well-equipped for the conditions.
"No-one wants to be in the position that I was, trapped on a mountain summit for five days in a storm.
"It's something that you might prepare yourself for as a mountaineer, and you can take every precaution to try and avoid it,  but sometimes things just take an unexpected turn. And that's what happened to me, and it really was a terrible experience, but I was lucky and I survived.
"Being in the mountains at any time of the year means you are entering an environment that is dangerous.
"In the Winter, particularly so, and there is a lot of dangers you have to be aware of like avalanches, bad weather, that kind of thing.
"It's all about being prepared, being well-trained, having the right equipment, and taking the right decisions on the day.
"I don't know what happened to these poor climbers up in Glen Coe, I don't think anyone does yet, but it sounds like they were well-equipped.
"Sometimes things do just go wrong and it's a great tragedy of the mountains. But nevertheless for many thousands of people every weekend it's providing a rich and life-enhancing experience, and that's not really something you can turn away from."
