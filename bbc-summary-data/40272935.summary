Aberdeen: Derek McInnes deserves Sunderland chance - Paul Lambert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes deserves another crack at managing in England, according to Paul Lambert.

Sunderland have agreed compensation with Aberdeen as they seek a replacement for David Moyes following their relegation to the Championship.
Having been sacked by Bristol City in 2013, McInnes has restored his reputation with a successful four-year spell in charge at Pittodrie.
"If he does go down to Sunderland I'm sure he'll do well," Lambert said.
Aberdeen's new major shareholder Dave Cormack insisted the club would "move heaven and earth" to keep their manager at Pittodrie, but Lambert says the lure of Sunderland will prove too strong to resist for McInnes.
"The lure is too big," the former Colchester, Norwich, Aston Villa and Blackburn manager told BBC Scotland. "The profile for yourself is big as well. I'm sure if Derek goes down to Sunderland his own profile will rise as well. He'll want to do that after the job he's done at Aberdeen.
"If he does go there it's not as if you're taking a small club, you're talking about a club with history behind it, a huge fan-base, big stadium, great training ground, it's got everything behind it. For him to turn it down would be a massive thing for Aberdeen.
"He had his little blip [at Bristol City] which everybody goes through. You lose a job, go into another one, make a success of it and people start to think we'll take him again. He deserves his chance at it. He's done really well at Aberdeen."
Sunderland were relegated last season after a 10-year stay in the Premier League, and Lambert warns that McInnes will be met with a fan-base expecting promotion straight back up to the top flight if he takes the reins at the Stadium of Light.
"It's a brilliant club. Massive fan-base and the problem will be the expectancy level to go straight back up. If he handles that, which he will do because he's done great at Aberdeen, then you've got a chance.
"He's not a novice. When he first came down to Bristol City that [lack of experience] was maybe a wee bit difficult for him. But fair play to him, he's kept going at it and he comes across really well. That's important."
Lambert left his post as manager of Wolves at the end of the season after just seven months in charge at Molineux. The former Celtic and Borussia Dortmund midfielder departed after a disagreement with the club's hierarchy on who has the final say on player transfers.
Should McInnes leave for Sunderland, Lambert has no interest in taking over at Pittodrie or indeed return to manage anywhere in Scotland in the near future.
"I've been in England since 2005 and I've had some great moments and some hard moments which every manager goes through. I've had some great times, worked with some great lads so I'm happy," Lambert said.
"Ok I'm not doing anything at the minute, but there are one or two things that people have asked me to do and I'll look at that. I don't see myself coming back up [to Scotland]."
