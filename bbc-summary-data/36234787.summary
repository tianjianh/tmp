[SN]TITLE[SN]
Partick Thistle 2-2 Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle and Hamilton shared four goals in an entertaining final-day draw to cement Premiership finishes in ninth and 10th place respectively.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All four goals came inside the first 20 minutes, Kris Doolan opening the scoring with a header from a corner.
Eamonn Brophy equalised from the penalty spot for Accies before David Amoo headed Thistle back in front.
But Brophy rounded the keeper to level, and might have had a hat-trick in the second half but his drive hit a post.
That opening period provided terrific entertainment, though neither management team would have been delighted with the defending on view.
Accies' debutant keeper Alan Martin saved well from Amoo low at his near post inside the first two minutes, but from the resultant corner the visitors fell behind.
They failed to properly deal with the delivery from James Penrice - the impressive 17-year-old full-back - and the ball eventually bounced towards Doolan, who headed in his 14th goal of the season.
Indecision at the other end soon allowed Accies to pull level. Ryan Scully stuck out a leg, which impeded Danny Redmond, prompting referee Alan Muir to award the penalty, which was coolly converted by Brophy.
Managers routinely express fury at losing goals from set-pieces, so when Martin Canning's side conceded a second goal from an almost identical scenario to the first, the Accies boss - a centre-back himself - would surely have been furious.
Again Penrice swung the ball in from the right, Frederic Frans headed goalwards and almost on the goal-line, Amoo helped the ball into the net.
But Accies' response was even quicker this time as Brophy was left completely unmarked to collect Greg Docherty's pass, round the keeper and slot the ball in.

Twice in the second half, Brophy was denied a hat-trick by the frame of the goal - first a 25-yard drive came back off the post and later the striker curled a shot against the crossbar.
Aiden Nesbitt was a livewire for Thistle and came closest to a winner for the home side when he lobbed Martin but, like Brophy, was denied by the crossbar.
Nesbitt's was one of several impressive displays from some of the talented youngsters on show - Penrice and David Wilson also shone for Thistle, while Brophy and Docherty showed great promise for Accies.
There was almost a fitting farewell for another Accies youth academy product, Ziggy Gordon, who will leave the club in the summer.
But with the goal gaping and 90 seconds remaining, he blasted over the bar to ensure the spoils were shared.
