[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has won the primary in the US territory of Puerto Rico.

Projections give her more than 60% of the vote, compared with just over 35% for her rival, Bernie Sanders.
Mrs Clinton is now less than 30 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to win the nomination, according to an Associated Press count.
On Sunday Mrs Clinton and Mr Sanders both campaigned in California, ahead of Tuesday's primary.
Mrs Clinton and Mr Sanders are in a dead heat in California, but delegates in the state are awarded on a proportional basis.
Five other states also hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, including New Jersey. In all, 694 delegates are up for grabs.
Even if Mrs Clinton loses in California, she may still secure her party's nomination and take on the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.
Although they take part in the primary process, residents of Puerto Rico and other US territories are not entitled to vote in the presidential election.
