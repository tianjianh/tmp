[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have completed what is believed to be the remotest Base jump in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Brentford and Darren Strafford jumped off the 900ft cliffs at Nebbifield in Foula, Shetland, with parachutes.
Base stands for 'building, antenna, span, earth' - the four fixed structures base jumpers can jump from.
Mr Brentford, of Leeds, told BBC Scotland: "I discovered it had never been jumped. The weather had to be spot on, with no wind."
He added: "It's a pretty special and unique experience. All you can see in front of you is the sea. It's that sense of exploration. That's very exciting."
