The team of Fiona Pennie, Lizzie Neave and Kimberley Woods produced a controlled effort to beat Germany into second place by over four seconds.
"The team event was a nice consolation prize after not doing as well as we'd have liked to in the individual event," said Neave.
"We all had a really good run and it's always nice to come away with a medal."
Mallory Franklin won bronze in the women's C1 in Liptovsky on Saturday, while there was also a gold for the women's C1 team and a bronze for their male counterparts.
