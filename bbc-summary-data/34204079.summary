And they will be joined by Inglot, 29, and Lindstedt after they overcame sixth seeds Rohan Bopanna of India and Romania's Florin Mergea 7-6 (7-2) 6-3.
The pair will meet French duo Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut.
Inglot, who partnered with Mergea until the Briton was dropped in March, will compete in his first Grand Slam semi-final against the 12th seeds.
