Swede Ericsson, 25, begins his second season with the team after finishing 18th in the drivers' standings last year with nine points.
"This season I'd like to see us being in contention for points and fighting on a level where speed is decisive," said Ericsson.
"I'm convinced that we're going to take a step forward."
Ericsson's Sauber team-mate is 23-year-old Brazilian Felipe Nasr.
The 2016 Formula 1 season begins with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne on 20 March.
