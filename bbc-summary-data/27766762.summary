[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tourists will no longer be charged twice as much as Guernsey residents to use the bus.

The standard fare for a single journeys will be £1 from Wednesday, said an Environment Department spokesman.
It is the "first step" in the move to trial a free bus service for 18 months, agreed as part of the recently approved transport strategy.
The system of charging locals £1 and visitors £2, introduced in May 2013, has been heavily criticised.
The spokesman said: "This decision addresses the much publicised concerns expressed from various quarters."
All other fares, including the £2 fare for the night bus services, multi-journey cards and unlimited travel passes, are not affected by the change.
