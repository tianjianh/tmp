Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has rebuked Republican campaign rival Donald Trump saying "I no longer think he is funny".

Ms Clinton had downplayed the former TV star, making jokes about his campaign.
She said her rival's recently proposed ban on Muslims entering the US was "dangerous".
Mr Trump set off global condemnation with his ban idea, which came days after a Muslim couple attacked a health centre in San Bernardino, California.
A recent poll showed that a majority of Americans opposed Mr Trump's ban idea, while 25% of those polled were in favour of it.
"Now he has gone way over the line," Ms Clinton said during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers. "What he is saying now is not only shameful and wrong, it is dangerous".
She said that Mr Trump is giving groups like the so-called Islamic State (IS) "a great propaganda tool" and "a way to recruit more folks from Europe and the United States".
Mr Trump's proposal earlier this week was met with an intense backlash in the US and across the globe from leaders who said it was divisive.

Ms Clinton's appearance on the comedy show also broached the topic of her husband's role in the White House, if she were to be elected.
She said that her husband Bill - a former president who would become the first male presidential spouse - would be a great adviser on how to deal with "difficult people" like Russian President Vladimir Putin, but would not be good at "picking out flower arrangements".
At one point, the host suggested that Democrats had not courted gun owners who supported further regulations on their sale and use.
"I do think we don't have the right approach to it," Ms Clinton said of political efforts to place restrictions on guns in the US. "We do need to reach out to responsible gun owners and say we can do more to prevent as many deaths as possible".
Ms Clinton and Mr Trump are leading the polls among candidates in their respective parties. The next Republican debate is on Tuesday, and the next Democratic debate is on 19 December.
