Trains travelling at speeds of up to 250 mph will connect London with Manchester and Leeds by the year 2032.
So the Newsround team have been taking a look at five of the fastest trains on the planet...
The snappily named CRH380A train (CRH stands for China Railway High-speed!) holds the Guinness World Record for the world's fastest passenger train.
It hit a top speed of 302.05 mph in December 2010, on a stretch of track between Zaozhuang city in Shandong Province and Bengbu city in eastern Anhui Province.
'Floating' maglev (short for magnetically levitated) trains don't have wheels - they use magnetic power to lift them and propel them along the tracks.
A MLX01 maglev train in Japan reached a whopping 361 mph on a test track in December 2003. These trains aren't currently carrying passengers in Japan yet.
Japan is famous for its super speedy and stylish bullet trains, which were launched in 1964.
A Japanese bullet train holds the record of fastest average speed on a train journey - the 500 Series Nozomi reached an average speed of 162.7 mph on the 119-mile line between Hiroshima and Kokura on the island of Honshu.
French people have been enjoying 200 mph rail travel since 1981 with TGV, which stands for Train Ã  Grande Vitesse ("high speed train" in English).
A type of TGV called V150 holds the record for the highest speed on any national rail system - it hit a whopping 357.2 mph in April 2007.
One for fans of more traditional train travel - this is Mallard, the world's fastest steam train!
The A4 class locomotive achieved a speed of 126 mph, hauling seven coaches weighing 243 tonnes down Stoke Bank, near Essendine, between Grantham and Peterborough on 3 July 1938.
Mallard is now on display at the National Railway Museum in York, but three other A4s are in operation in the UK.
