Scottish Labour leadership hopefuls have called for the party to focus on Holyrood and reconnect with Scotland.

Kezia Dugdale said she does not want the party to split from UK Labour, but said it must become more autonomous and concentrate on the Scottish Parliament.
Ken Macintosh also called for reforms of party structure, suggesting the deputy leader should be a councillor.
Current leader Jim Murphy is standing down this month following Labour's poor performance at the general election.
Ms Dugdale told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme: "I favour a much more autonomous Scottish Labour Party, I'd like to see us set our own policy here, but I don't support an independent party - I think that's wrong.
"I'd like to see us on more regular occasions have a slightly different, a more nuanced position, on the issues in Scotland, standing up for Scotland's interests."
Ms Dugdale said it was time to take forward the party's values, and everything else is "baggage".
She added: "The Scottish Parliament is now the centre of Scottish politics, the Labour party has taken a long time to recognise that and I want to be part of a new generation of Labour members that lead that, that put the Scottish Parliament front-and-centre of our party."
In a video blog emailed to party councillors, Mr Macintosh said Labour needed radical changes to reconnect with Scotland.
He added: "We need to become more open, more transparent and we must shift control of our party from the corridors of power to the communities of Scotland.
"With over 300 councillors working day-in day-out, it's time to ensure they have a real say in the leadership of our party.
"That's why I believe the next deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party should come from local government."
Meanwhile, one of the party's MSPs has been reported as calling for Labour to form a breakaway Scottish party.
The Sunday Herald quotes Alex Rowley as saying Scottish Labour needs to be "an autonomous political party in its own right... free from the constraints of a UK party that understandably has other priorities".
