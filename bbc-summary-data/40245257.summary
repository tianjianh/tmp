[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident involving a silver BMW and grey Ford Kuga happened on the southbound motorway near junction 18 at about 04:45.
Police said one man was pronounced dead at the scene and another was taken to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary and released after treatment.
The road was closed for about 10 hours while investigations continued but reopened at about 15:00.
Sgt Leigh McCulloch said: "Inquiries are at an early stage to establish the full circumstances surrounding this fatal road crash and it is important that we speak to any witnesses who were driving on the motorway around the time it happened.
"In particular we would like to speak to the driver of a grey Toyota who is understood to have passed the scene just after the incident occurred.
"We would also appeal to anyone else who was driving on the north or southbound carriageway around the time of the crash who may have seen either of the cars involved, or even witnessed what happened, to get in touch."
