The 23-year-old earns a reported Â£50,000 a week in a deal running until 2020 and talks have opened with Spurs about improving that.
Despite being out for seven weeks with injury, the England player has scored five goals this term, including two in a  3-2 win over West Ham on Saturday.
"I am happy at the club and want to be here for a long, long time," said Kane.
"We are in talks and I'm sure we will get something sorted. I'm not panicking and I'm not demanding anything as I've read in the paper."
"We're having a conversation and I have no doubts that we will get it sorted," added Kane.
Kane scored 21 times in the top flight in 2014-15 and won the Golden Boot with 25 league goals last season.
After the West Ham match on Saturday, Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino said Kane was "one of the best strikers in the world".
"Hopefully we will have no issues with the contract - we have only just started talking about it. Get that down and get that wrapped up," said Kane.
"We've got a great young team, new training ground, new stadium being built, great young manager. The future is very bright.
"It's important that we keep hold of all our players and keep building on this great team that we have."
