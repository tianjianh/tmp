Stock cars, classic cars and motorbikes were on display at the three-day MotoFest event, which was held for the first time in 2014.
Demonstrations of motorsports took place on the city's ring road although plans to hold racing there had to be scrapped.
The event's organisers said they were "really happy" with how the event went.
Festival director James Noble, who is an elder at Jubilee Church in the city, said the event was "all about Coventry".
"You wouldn't try to do this in any other city," he said.
"It's a way of giving something back to Coventry."
The church, together with a number of partners including Coventry City Council and Coventry University, helped organise the festival.
As well as static displays of classic cars, American police vehicles and military vehicles, spectators could watch demonstrations of stock cars, race cars and motorcycles.
Mr Noble said the reaction from spectators and sponsors had been very positive and a 2016 event will "definitely" be held.
He hopes a legislation change may allow time trials to be held on the ring road in the future, he added.
