[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ann Clwyd talks about her husband's hospital death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ann Clwyd says medical staff at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW) in Cardiff treated her husband Owen Roberts with arrogance and indifference in his final days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Labour MP for Cynon Valley talked to me about her complaint over her late husband's care.
Mr Roberts, a former head of news and current affairs for BBC Cymru Wales and an ITV executive, had been treated for multiple sclerosis before his death in October.
UHW says it would like to discuss Ms Clwyd's complaints with her, while the Welsh government said it recognised that more work needed to be done to ensure that all patients receive high quality care.
