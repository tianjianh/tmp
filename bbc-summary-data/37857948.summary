Humberside Police efficiency 'not good enough'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Humberside Police's efforts at reducing crime and keeping people safe is still "not good enough", a watchdog has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force "requires improvement" in efficiency, according to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC).
Its report raised concerns over the number of officers available and stated that "on occasions priority incidents are attended late or unallocated".
Chief Constable Justine Curran said the force was improving its call handling and recruiting 300 new officers.

Last year, the force was the only one in England and Wales to be classed as "inadequate" at keeping people safe and reducing crime.
Earlier this year, it was also rated "inadequate" at investigating crimes.
Mike Cunningham, from HMIC, said the force's rating "is a standard that is not good enough".
"We set a standard when we assess forces as good," he added.
"That's the standard that the public can expect. That's the standard that the public deserves."
Ms Curran said the force had "worked really hard" to achieve an improvement on its previous inadequate rating.
"We know we have more to do and we will do it, but this is a long-term plan and, as with all long-term change, I expect there will be ups and there will be downs along the way."
