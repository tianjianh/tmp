Neil Warnock: Struggling Wigan are Cardiff City's toughest test yet

Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock believes Saturday's home Championship match against struggling Wigan Athletic will be his toughest test yet.

Warnock made it seven points from nine since taking charge on 5 October when the Bluebirds won at Nottingham Forest.
But despite a trip to Newcastle looming it is the visit of Wigan, who have sacked manager Gary Caldwell, which has the 67-year-old concerned.
"We've got our most difficult game coming up, I think," Warnock said.
"It's not a top of the league game, but it's a very good Championship team. We've got to try to get three points before we go to Newcastle."
Lying just one place off the bottom of the Championship, Caldwell was shown the door after 18 months in charge despite winning the League One title last season.
Cardiff though have been handed a blow ahead of clash with striker Ricky Lambert set to miss out with a badly cut shin.
But since taking charge following the sacking of Paul Trollope, Warnock has overseen an upturn in Cardiff's fortunes with wins over Bristol City and Forest and a draw at home to Sheffield Wednesday lifting the Bluebirds out of the relegation places.
Warnock revealed the secret behind the transformation was a rather simple one.
"I asked them after the Bristol City game, how do you feel tonight in the dressing room?" added the Bluebirds' boss.
"This is what we want to feel. I've come to enjoy myself.  I want them to enjoy themselves and they are, you can see they're enjoying themselves.
"It's hard work, but when you come off with three points and satisfaction, it's a good weekend."
