A cat's death after being stabbed with a screwdriver has sparked an RSPCA appeal for information in Cambridgeshire.

The 14-month old tabby and white called Pumbaa was found bleeding in a Peterborough alleyway on Saturday.
The stab wound was so deep the vet was unable to operate before Pumbaa died.
A second cat - Mischief - was shot by an air rifle in an area near to where Pumbaa was stabbed, according to the RSPCA.
It is unclear whether the two incidents are linked.
RSPCA inspector Justin Stubbs said: "These were two shocking and completely senseless attacks."
Pumbaa's owner, Kirsty Cracknell, 29, of Croyland Road, said: "I am utterly devastated about Pumbaa - he was such a soppy little mummy's boy. I just keep expecting him to jump through the window.
"What particularly breaks my heart is that I think he must have been on his way home to me, considering where he was found."
