Jack Cornwell died aged 16 after fighting in the Battle of Jutland. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery.
Memorials across the country are being protected ahead of the centenary of the naval battle.
A ceremony will take place at Manor Park Cemetery in London, where Jack's family will visit his grave.
The battle on 31 May 1916 saw 6,094 British and 2,551 German personnel lose their lives.
Jack was serving on the HMS Chester on 30 May 1916 when it came under heavy fire from four German ships. All of Jack's gun crew were fatally injured.
He remained at his post awaiting orders, despite severe shrapnel wounds, but died on 2 June.
Following a national campaign which hailed him as the "boy hero" of the battle, Jack was awarded the Victoria Cross and buried in a new grave with full military honours.
