Victorian worthies and jazz age stars autographs sell for £3,600

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Autographs of Victorian worthies and jazz age stars have been sold at auction for £3,600.

The "mixed bag" of 75 signatures include Queen Victoria, writer Rudyard Kipling, nurse Florence Nightingale and band leader Duke Ellington.
Seller David Hill said he was "very pleased" with how much his late grandmother's autograph book sold for.
Auctioneer George Holtby said the sale price reflected a "very well-rounded and interesting collection".
Mr Hill, 72, from Bishops Lydeard, Somerset, said 80% of the autographs were collected by his grandmother who gave him the book about 50 years ago.
He said the remaining 20% came from his mother Barbara Nuttall, who is now 101, and reflected her "participation and interest in the jazz movement in the 1930s in this country".
Other autographs include artists such as Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds, and authors and poets including TE Lawrence and William Wordsworth.
Another former monarch, King William IV, is also part of the collection.
Mr Hill said some of the autographs were from letters written to his family which included "quite a large proportion of Victorian worthies".
He remembered his grandmother telling him she also wrote to well-known people and "just asked" for their autograph.
Mr Hill said: "I've enjoyed having them but I am not really an autograph collector, I feel they could be of more value to somebody else.
"Autographs generally are becoming a thing of the past in the electronic age, and somehow the stamp of the individual, the aura of the person is kept in the autograph and the signature, I think."
George Holtby, from Charterhouse Auctions in Sherborne, Dorset said: "People such as Queen Victoria, who was alive for a hell of a long time, signed a lot of pieces of paper.
"Then you've got other people who are much rarer. There's a lot of very interesting jazz-related photographs signed and addressed to her [Mr Hill's mother] so they're personal, people like Louis Armstrong.
"Other big names [include] a 'little scrap of paper' with the name  Isambard Kingdom Brunel."
