Arthur Collins, 24, is accused of 14 counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and one of throwing corrosive fluid on a person.
Twenty people were hurt when they were doused with a substance at the Mangle E8 club in Hackney on 17 April.
Mr Collins and a 21-year-old man are due on trial on 9 October.
Andre Phoenix of Clyde Road, Tottenham, is charged with seven counts of throwing a corrosive fluid with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
No pleas were entered when both men appeared via videolink at Wood Green Crown Court.
Confirming the date for their trial, Judge Peter Ader told the men "there will be other hearings, but you will be (attending) via videolink."
Mr Collins of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, who is also the father of Ms McCann's unborn child, only said the word "yes" when the judge spoke to him at the end of the hearing.
He and Mr Phoenix are next due to appear at the same court on 13 June.
