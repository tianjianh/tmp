A 94-year-old American is celebrating more than four decades of working at McDonald's restaurants.

Loraine Maurer of Evansville, Indiana, works two shifts per week, 44 years after joining the hamburger chain.
The nonagenarian great-grandmother first joined in 1973 after her husband retired due to disability.
"I told him we were too young to stay at home and so I went for a job," she recalled after enjoying a cake at a special party colleagues threw for her.
She never meant to stay as long as she did, Mrs Maurer told ABC News, adding that she never thought of becoming a manager because she prefers to interact with her customers.
"She is the only one here that knows how to make oats right," said one loyal customer who attended her party.
After her husband died in 1980, she began to travel more often with a friend, often visiting McDonald's wherever she went.
"I've been to Australia, Russia, Greece, Rome, and I'd always look when I could fly over the cities. I'd look for the arch."
One location even offered to serve her beer.
"That surprised me!" she said with a chuckle.
Even though she contemplates retirement every winter, she says she never plans to leave.
"I would miss it too much", says Mrs Maurer, who has four children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.
"I really and truly enjoy it," Mrs Maurer adds. "Life is what you make it. And so I'm trying."
