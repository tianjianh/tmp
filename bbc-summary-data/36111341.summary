Jenkins, a two-time world champion who was fifth at London 2012, joins Welsh team-mate Non Stanford and Vicky Holland, who qualified last year.
Double Commonwealth Games champion Jodie Stimpson misses out.
"I'd love to go to Rio and medal," said Jenkins. "If it doesn't happen, It's not the end of the world."
Jenkins, who won world triathlon titles in 2008 and 2011, helped her Olympic selection push by winning the Gold Coast World Series event this month.
Jenkins would like to improve on her fifth place in London when she races in Rio but is philosophical about her chances.

"You almost think before then, it's so hard, the build-up," she said. "Not just the pressure but the expectation I have of myself to go and perform and medal.
"It didn't happen [in London] and you realise that nothing changes."
Olympic champion Alistair Brownlee and his brother, Jonathan, have been selected for the men's team, which has one place left.
"Performances will be assessed next month following the ITU World Triathlon Yokohama to fill the remaining quota place and nominate reserves," read a British Triathlon statement. "The team will be announced in early June."
England's Stimpson, who finished 12th in the Gold Coast event, will compete alongside 2013 world champion Stanford and Vicky Holland in the latest ITU World Triathlon Series race in Cape Town on Sunday.
Jenkins will sit it out as she continues her Olympic preparation.
