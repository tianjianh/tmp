The 10ft-high "maquettes" were used as a basis for the world-famous sculpture at the Helix Parkland, a Â£43m regeneration project near Falkirk.
The sculpture is at the junction of Princes Street, Shandwick Place and Lothian Road until the end of the Edinburgh Festival.
It is hoped the mini-Kelpies will drive tourists to the main attraction.
Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city council's transport convener, said: "These fantastic creations represent a modern Scottish landmark so we are delighted to be able to host them here over the busy festival period.
"The west end of Edinburgh is currently undergoing a series of improvements which, alongside this striking artwork, will vastly improve the area for residents, shoppers and visitors to the city."
Adrian Mahoney, Falkirk Council's spokesman for culture, leisure and tourism, said: "We're absolutely thrilled that the Maquettes will be in the thick of it during the Edinburgh Festival this year, promoting The Kelpies to the millions of visitors who are expected to travel to the capital for the event.
"It will encourage tourists to learn about this fantastic public sculpture and take a short trip to the Falkirk area to see it for themselves during their stay."
