Camelia Lupu was last seen leaving her home address in Stalybridge at around 16:05 BST on Wednesday 7 September.
Her brother, Noevelle Lupu, has also been reported missing. He was last seen at 10.30 on Wednesday 14 September in Kimberley Street, Oldham.
It is believed the pair are with 19-year-old Marius Savin who is wanted on suspicion of their abduction.
Camelia is approximately 5ft tall, of slim build with long black hair. She is described as having olive skin and may speak with a Romanian accent.
She was last seen wearing a black leather jacket, black jeans, navy blue trainers with pink trim and red lipstick.
Noevelle is described as Romanian, also around 5ft tall with short dark hair.
The siblings may now be in the south of England and port systems have been made aware, Greater Manchester police said.
Sgt Lindsey Curry said: "Concerns are rising from Camelia and Noevelle, as we believe they could be being taken out of the country.
"Marius Savin does not have their welfare at heart and we are extremely concerned for their safety."
