[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal for stories and memorabilia to mark the Tay Road Bridge's 50th anniversary has drawn an encouraging response, organisers have said.

Souvenirs and photographs from the bridge's opening day on 18 August 1966 are being sought for a mobile exhibition.
Organisers said people who worked on the bridge's construction have also come forward to share their stories.
A series of events is being planned to mark the bridge's half-century.
The bridge's operational manager Fiona Fraser said: "I'm very pleased at the response that we've had.
"I've invited some of the people in to record them because we're hoping to have an exhibition that will go mobile, possibly around libraries around Dundee, Angus and Fife.
"One person said he worked on the bridge when he was only 17 as a piping hand."
"I've also had the daughter of a traffic policeman, who was in the first car across the bridge before the Queen Mother, get in touch and I hope to speak to him."
Despite thousands of people turning out for the bridge's opening ceremony, Ms Fraser said not everyone in Dundee realised its significance.
She said: "One chap told me he was in the arcade spending his ninth-birthday money and he came out and the Queen Mother was passing.
"He didn't even know that was the opening of the Tay Road Bridge. There are lots of nice little stories coming out."
Newspaper supplements have been handed in to the team and Ms Fraser said they were keen to track down other souvenirs from the day.
She said: "A gentleman was cleaning his mum's house and found memorabilia of the bridge opening.
"There are pull-out pieces with the men who worked on the bridge.
"We believe there was a tapestry of the Tay Road Bridge and we're on the lookout for anyone who knows about that. We would love to track that down."
