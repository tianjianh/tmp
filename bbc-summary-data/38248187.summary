A request by Brad Pitt to seal court documents in his custody and divorce proceedings involving Angelina Jolie has been rejected by a judge.

But Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard Burdge Jr did not rule out sealing specific documents, including those related to the couple's children.
Pitt and Jolie were not at the hearing at which Pitt's motion was rejected.
Jolie cited irreconcilable differences when she filed to end her marriage to the fellow actor in September.
Pitt and Jolie were together since 2005 and married for two years before their sudden split.
Pitt has filed for joint custody of the couple's six children, who are aged between eight to 15.
The judge said the court "recognises privacy rights of minor children and would be guided by what's in the minor children's best interest."
Last month an investigation into whether Pitt was abusive towards his son Maddox in September ended with no finding of wrongdoing.
The FBI subsequently confirmed Pitt would not be charged with any crime relating to an alleged incident on board a private flight from France to Los Angeles.
