[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plan to spruce up approaches to Inverness

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors are to consider ideas designed to improve the approaches to Inverness by road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Local authority officers have suggested running demonstration projects to show how people's first encounter with the city could be made better.
The ideas include a "gateway structure" - a standing stone-like monument - at Clachnaharry.
Telford Roundabout and the central reservation of the A82 at the Longman could be also be planted with shrubs.
Members of Highland Council's city of Inverness area committee will be asked to give these projects the go-ahead at a meeting next week.
