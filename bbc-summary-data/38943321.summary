Bugiel, who has scored 15 goals this season, has agreed a deal to run until the summer of 2018.
"It is a higher division so I've got to prove myself. I'm definitely going to give 100 per cent," he said.
Bugiel could play in Saturday's game against Boreham Wood, subject to FA and National League approval.
Meanwhile, Forest Green forward Olly Mehew, 19, has joined Southern Premier Division side Dorchester Town on loan.
