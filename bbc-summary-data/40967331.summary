Uefa are to look into the crowd trouble which halted Everton's Europa League play-off match against Hajduk Split.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Play was suspended in the 33rd minute after supporters in the away end at Goodison Park surged towards the pitch and objects were thrown.
The teams waited on the side of the pitch before the police and stewards restored order.
Visiting players appealed for calm and the match resumed after a break of almost five minutes.
Everton had opened the scoring moments before the trouble broke out through Michael Keane's header.
The Toffees added a second goal through Idrissa Gueye shortly after the game restarted and they held on to win 2-0.
"I am disappointed, but it's not my job," said Everton manager Ronald Koeman. "We needed to stop the game. I don't know what happened."
