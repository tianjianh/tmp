The supermarket giant said it has decided not to renew the lease, which it has held for 38 years.
The store will close on 15 August. All 225 members of staff have been told they are at risk of redundancy.
"Our priority is to do everything we can to find alternative roles within Tesco for as many affected colleagues as possible," a spokesman said.
The company said it has several Express and Metro stores in the area.
In January, Tesco announced it was shutting 43 stores across the country following successive years of falling sales and profits.
