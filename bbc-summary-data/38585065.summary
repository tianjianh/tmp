The rifled muzzle loader shells were found on Gwbert Beach, near Cardigan, in the 1880s and have been kept in the museum stores for the last 10 years.
Although previously deemed safe, a recent check found traces of explosive.
The shells were taken to Borth beach on Tuesday and detonated by a unit from Gloucester.
The museum curator Carrie Canham, said: "Although the shells have been inspected by various experts over the years, and were confident that they were safe, a recent check was carried out by the bomb disposal unit who found traces of explosive and recommended their safe disposal."
