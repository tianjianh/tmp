The University of Aberdeen is attempting to raise Â£4.5m in five years to establish an oncology research unit.
The Friends of Anchor (Aberdeen and North Centre for Haematology, Oncology and Radiotherapy) charity has pledged Â£1m.
It is hoped having a dedicated team could attract funding and trials.
Prof Steve Heys, head of the School of Medicine at the University of Aberdeen, said: "The support of Friends of Anchor is second to none and will be pivotal in helping us achieve our goal of establishing Aberdeen as a centre for world-class cancer research.
"Such a centre will enable the university and NHS Grampian to attract and retain first-class academic and clinical staff and so contribute to clinical excellence through patient care and participation in clinical trials."
Friends of Anchor trustee Prof Henry Watson said: "This ambitious plan will identify oncology research as a top priority for Aberdeen.
"The appointment of an outstanding oncology research team will bring many benefits."
