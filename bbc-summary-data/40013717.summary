The 32-year-old was part of the team that won Great Britain's first gold medal in the sport at Rio 2016, beating the Netherlands in the final.
Macleod will now focus on her coaching role with the England Under-21 side.
"I feel a great sense of content with what I have achieved alongside incredible friends, team-mates, coaches and support staff," she said.
"What I take forward is not a list of accomplishments but the inspiration I have gained from seeing my team-mates endure, hurt, cry, thrive and roar with such joy and elation you will only ever witness in sport.
"It is seeing these emotions from individuals all striving to achieve a common goal that will live long in my memory."
As a result of the GB team's achievement, the members were recognised in the New Year's honours list, and Macleod was made an MBE.
