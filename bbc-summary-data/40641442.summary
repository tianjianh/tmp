Celtic 4-0 Linfield

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic eased into the Champions League third qualifying round with a 4-0 home win completing a 6-0 aggregate success against Linfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts dominated possession at Celtic Park and Scott Sinclair's finish after four minutes set the tone.
Sinclair scored again after the second half opened with Tom Rogic's superb long-range strike, with Stuart Armstrong netting in stoppage time.
Celtic meet Rosenborg of Norway next week, with the first leg in Glasgow.
Linfield set out to try to contain the Scottish Premiership champions, but their resistance faltered and goalkeeper Roy Carroll produced two excellent saves in keeping with his performance in the first-leg last Friday in Belfast.
He denied Moussa Dembele in the first-half and then Sinclair as he looked to complete his hat-trick with a dipping shot from long range before the end.
Olivier Ntcham made his debut for Celtic following the 21-year-old midfielder's move from Manchester City.
Celtic's two-goal advantage from the first leg at Windsor Park was always going to be added to in a substantial way, the only question being how many they would manage to get.
A vast home support turned out to see it and they were rewarded with a goal inside four minutes when a shot from Ntcham broke to Sinclair, who scored from a tight angle.
The sense then was that an onslaught was coming, but it was an onslaught that took a long time to reap more goals.
Celtic had multiple chances but couldn't find the accuracy to convert them. Dembele, Rogic and Sinclair had two excellent opportunities apiece before the break but all of them went begging. At least two of them were sitters.
Ntcham, the Â£4.5m signing, was a presence in the heart of the park, and the Frenchman comes with a big reputation.
The president of his loan club for the last two seasons, Genoa, once compared him to Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.
That's a bit of a fanciful notion, but Ntcham looks a powerful player with a perceptive touch. It will be interesting to see how he develops in this Celtic team.
Rogic smashed in a second goal just two minutes after the restart and, seven minutes later, Sinclair made it three when finishing smartly after benefiting from a lucky break of the ball off Linfield's Jamie Mulgrew.
There would have been a hat-trick for Sinclair had it not been for a wonderful save from the veteran Carroll in the Linfield goal. The 39-year-old stretched out an arm and put Sinclair's effort on to the crossbar.
By then, Celtic fans knew that it was Rosenborg awaiting them in the next round. The Norwegian side sneaked past Dundalk and will pose a bigger threat to Brendan Rodgers' team than Linfield, who conceded a fourth in stoppage time.
Jonny Hayes and Kundai Benyu came into the game and both were dangerous. Hayes went close to scoring and Benyu's grace on the ball posed the visitors more problems. He was involved in the build-up to the final goal, smashed home by another substitute, Armstrong.
