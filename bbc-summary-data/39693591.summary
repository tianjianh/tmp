Lincoln City: National League winners target Championship after promotion celebrations

Lincoln City are capable of emulating Burton Albion's run from non-league to the Championship, according to managing director Kevin Cooke.

The Imps won the National League title on Saturday, eight years after Burton began their ascent up the Football League.
"I think it's realistic [to reach the Championship]," Cooke told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
"I don't see why we can't do that, as long as you put good foundations down."
The 2-1 victory over Macclesfield ended Lincoln's five-year absence from the Football League and capped a memorable first season in charge for manager Danny Cowley and his brother Nicky, who is his assistant.
They became the first non-league team since 1914 to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals, bowing out at Arsenal, and also made the last four of the FA Trophy.
Cooke estimated a season in League Two could be worth about Â£1m to the Imps and said the money earned from their success this season could fund another promotion push next term.
He said: "I can't speak for others but, me personally, I want to see us up there in the play-offs as a minimum.
"We've certainly got the management team that are capable of doing that and I also believe that we've got players that are capable of doing that.
"As long as we can back them with what they need, in terms of resources - not just money - then why not?"
Boss Cowley said he had allowed his players a night to let their hair down on Saturday, even though they still have league games at Maidstone and Southport left to play - but admitted he and his brother's celebrations were more low key.
He said: "I was pretty boring to be honest. Nicky and I and our families went for a nice quiet meal, then went home and watched Match of the Day!
"By all accounts the players were having a good time but they deserved a moment to celebrate.
"When you have worked as hard as they have, day-in day-out, it's important you celebrate."
