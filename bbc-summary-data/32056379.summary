'Serious concerns' raised in Hull Prison inspection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Serious concerns" have been raised over the operation of Hull Prison following an unannounced inspection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Inspectors found vulnerable prisoners held on the first-night wing were subject to "unacceptable abuse" and some prisoners felt "unsafe".
However, the report also said the jail was working well in other areas with "much good work".
Hull Prison, in East Yorkshire, is an inner-city prison holding more than 1,000 men and young offenders.
The report said too many of the inmates were in cramped cells designed for one prisoner.
Mr Hardwick, chief inspector of prisons, said: "Outcomes for prisoners at Hull were very mixed.
"On balance, we judged that enough of the basics were in place for most prisoners for outcomes to be reasonably good overall.
"Nevertheless, there were some serious concerns in all areas."
He said inspectors would return "more quickly than usual" to the prison to make sure progress had been made, although the prison was "working well" in comparison with others inspected recently.
Inspectors did find the prison was calm and said support for prisoners on the drug recovery wing was excellent.
About a third of those held in Hull Prison are serving sentences of four years or more for serious offences and many of these men are sex offenders.
The prison has seen an increase in population after two closed Victorian wings were brought back into use.
Michael Spurr, chief executive officer of the national offender management service, said: "I am pleased the chief inspector found Hull to be performing reasonably well..."
The inspection was carried out from 6 to 17 October 2014.
HM Inspectorate of Prisons is independent and reports on the treatment and conditions for prisoners in England and Wales.
