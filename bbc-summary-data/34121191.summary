[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The summer holidays are officially over, and lots of you will be heading back to school again.

For some of you, this will mean making the move from primary to secondary school.
There'll be new challenges, lots of new faces and there's a chance you might get lost looking for lessons.
We've been taking a look at what kind of things you can expect when you start high school.
Starting a new school will likely mean a new uniform.
This can include lots of different things like a blazer and tie, as well as special school PE kit.
As well as keeping in touch with your friends from primary school, there will also be the chance to make new friends at high school.
These could be people who are in the same forms, classes or clubs as you.
Take a look at our Newsround Special for advice on making friends at a new school.
As there are more subjects to study in high school, there is often more homework too.
Try to put aside a bit of time each night to work on your homework, so you don't have lots to do all in one go.
High schools are often a lot bigger than primary schools, and trying to get around on your first day can be a bit confusing.
Lots of high schools will give you a map on your first day, which will help you to get around.
If you get lost on your way to a class don't be afraid to ask an older student or a teacher for advice, as they were all new once!
