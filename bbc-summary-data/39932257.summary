The Scottish Daily Mail describes the Glasgow-born killer as the "monster of the moors". It reports that he died at 18:00 on Monday at the secure psychiatric hospital where he had been receiving end-of-life care.
The Scottish Sun says Brady took to his grave the secret of where he buried 12-year-old Keith Bennett - the only victim whose remains are undiscovered.
Brady lived for more than 50 years after being jailed for his catalogue of crimes but he never showed any remorse, says The Daily Record.
The Herald reports that Jeremy Corbyn will make his "pitch for power" later, and he will use his manifesto launch to promise to campaign against a second Scottish independence referendum.
