Australian mining magnate Clive Palmer is seeking government support after a bid for money from a Chinese brokerage was rejected.

Mr Palmer, who is also a politician, lost a court bid on Monday for $48m (Â£32m) in disputed royalties from Citic Securities over an iron ore project.
He wanted to use that money to save his unrelated and troubled nickel business.
Queensland Nickel is one of Australia's biggest nickel refineries.
"I call on the Premier and the Treasurer to clear their diaries for urgent talks on these matters, for the sake of more than 2,000 local jobs," Queensland Nickel managing director Clive Mensink, who is also Mr Palmer's nephew, said in a statement to Reuters.
But local media reported that up to 800 jobs could be at risk.
Concerns over the refinery plant surfaced in October when Mr Palmer met with the state government, but at the time, he denied he was looking for a loan.
A spokesman for the Queensland Treasurer Curtis Pitt told Reuters news agency that the government was already asking for a meeting with Mr Palmer over the future of the refinery and had created an independent commission to investigate the matter.
Gaining access to financial and other records would be part of the talks on Tuesday, he said.
Meanwhile, in Monday's supreme court decision in Western Australia, Judge Paul Allan Tottle said the financial state of Mr Palmer's nickel business was a factor in the rejection for money from Citic.
"I am not satisfied on the evidence ... that the stark alternatives, namely grant the injunction or let Queensland Nickel suffer dire consequences, reflect an assessment of all options that one would expect to be considered when a major business is experiencing financial difficulties," he wrote in his decision.
Mr Palmer's company Mineralogy wanted to use the royalties from Citic to save his unrelated Queensland Nickel business.
China's biggest state-owned brokerage, Citic, bought the rights to its Sino Iron project from Mineralogy for $415m in 2006 and agreed to pay royalties after production had started.
However, the two firms have been in legal battles over the amount that is to be paid.
During the court case, Citic's lawyers questioned how the company could request payment from a long-running legal dispute and use it for another business.
