The baby swan, thought to be about four weeks old, was attacked by a group of children at a pool in Battlefield, Shrewsbury, on Thursday, the RSPCA said.
A spokesperson said reports suggested he was "thrown around and kicked" before the nest was set on fire.
He is now recovering at Cuan House Wildlife Rescue in Much Wenlock, but is in a "very poor state", the RSPCA said.
Fran Hill, from Cuan House, said the cygnet had initially looked as if he would "give up and die", but had since made good progress and was now feeding and drinking well.
"He's still not standing though. That's our biggest fear at the moment," she said.
"If we want to get him back [to his mother] it would need to be done within a week for her to accept him, otherwise he would have to be brought up in care."
Ms Hill said the swan's mother and another cygnet were on the pool at the time, but had been "spooked" by the fire.
The RSPCA appealed for information on the attack.
