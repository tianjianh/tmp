Ronald Reid death: Stuart Reid charged with murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 37-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Ronald Reid in County Down in 2014.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Reid, 63, was found in his apartment on Donaghadee Road, Bangor, on Christmas Eve that year.
Stuart Alexander Reid, whose address was given as Bingham Street in Bangor, was charged with his murder on a date unknown between 18 to 21 December.
His solicitor said he is currently detained at Knockbracken Health Care Park in south Belfast.
The lawyer asked for the case to be adjourned for two weeks, as arrangements for Mr Reid's attendance would have to be made with the hospital.
The application was granted by the judge.
