A woman who was abandoned as a baby in a cardboard box in Manchester has made an emotional appeal to find her parents, who she believes are from Ireland.

Elizabeth Rylands was just five days old when she was left in Grafton Street, in an area of the city known as 'Little Ireland' on 28 March 1958.
She said she was "shocked" and "devastated" when she found out.
"I don't think anyone expects to read that," she said.
"I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't that so yes, I was completely shocked."
Ms Rylands told the BBC's Sunday News that although she found out what had happened when she was 38 she decided to focus on raising her two daughters and "got on with my life".
It was only when she was forced out of her job due to back problems earlier this year that she found herself with "some time to myself" and started to think about her past.
"I think now since the start of this campaign, I'm just so focused on what my birth mother and birth father and birth family generally went through to leave me," she said.
"I'm really puzzled by this five day thing, that I was somewhere for five days, that's really odd I think, and what they must have gone through and the circumstances that led someone to do that.
"They must have been absolutely desperate to do that."
Results from a DNA test showed that Ms Rylands is 86% Irish and that led her to widen her appeal.
"Please, please come forward, say hello, let's have a conversation, it would just mean everything in the world to me," she said.
"I just hope you've had a really, really good life. There's nothing to feel guilty about whatsoever.
"I'm OK, my girls are OK and we'd all just love to say hello.
"We'd respect your privacy and if you didn't want any more than that after all this time because you've got your life and we've got ours as well, then that's brilliant as well, but please, please, it's so important for me to know where I come from and who I am."
