Andrea Gada: Zimbabwe family reapply for funeral visas

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Zimbabwean family of a girl who are seeking to visit the UK to attend her funeral have been told by the Home Office to reapply for temporary visas.

Five-year-old Andrea Gada died after she was hit by a car in Eastbourne, East Sussex, on 16 December.
Her parents have delayed her funeral hoping that her grandparents and aunt, who were refused visas, could attend. It is now due to be held on 9 February.
Stephen Lloyd MP said he was cautiously optimistic visas would now be approved.
He said the Home Office had been in touch with the family in Eastbourne asking their relatives to reapply for temporary travel permits.
The Liberal Democrat MP for Eastbourne and Willingdon said: "Since then I have worked with the family in Eastbourne over the submission."
"Basic compassion and humanity cries out" for Andrea's relatives to be allowed into the country, Mr Lloyd added.
"I hope and pray that the right decision will be taken imminently."
Last week, a petition signed by more than 93,000 people in support of their visas was handed in at Downing Street on behalf of Andrea's parents, Charity and Wellington Gada, of Downland Close, Eastbourne.
It said the family "pose no risk to the country" and "they simply want to support us and grieve the loss of our beautiful girl".
Mr Lloyd also raised the matter during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons on 14 January.
The Prime Minister said he would look into the case but the Home Office upheld its decision when it reviewed the family's application for a second time.
