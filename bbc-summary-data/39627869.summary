Snow and freezing conditions have returned to Scotland's hills.
The white stuff coming in April is not uncommon, but this spring and the recent winter have involved mixed weather of short cold spells followed by warmer conditions.
Earlier this month, the Scottish Avalanche Information Service (SAIS) wrapped up its latest forecasting season with the fewest recordings of avalanches in years.
The service is still providing updates on conditions in the areas it covers - Torridon, Glen Coe, Lochaber, Creag Meagaidh, Northern Cairngorms and Southern Cairngorms - via its individual team blogs.
Scotland's outdoor ski industry has also had a challenging winter and spring.
