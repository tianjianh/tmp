Captain Philipp Lahm and Franck Ribery also netted, and Lewandowski converted a penalty after Thiago was fouled.

Defender Mats Hummels, who joined from Borussia Dortmund in the summer, played the full 90 minutes, while 19-year-old midfielder Renato Sanches, a £27.5m signing from Benfica, was an unused substitute.
Ancelotti, who took charge following Pep Guardiola's summer departure for Manchester City, won the German Super Cup this month.

"We started very strongly, we scored the early goals and we controlled the match. All is well."
