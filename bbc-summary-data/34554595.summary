Special power lines are being fitted in parts of mid and north Wales to protect birds of prey.

It follows the death of an osprey in Mynydd Hiraethog, Conwy county, when its wings touched high voltage cables.
Wildlife enthusiasts have been working with electricity firm Scottish Power to make overhead lines safer for large birds such as ospreys and buzzards.
Man-made osprey nests are also being put up to deter the birds from perching on wooden electricity poles.
"I just felt that this can't be allowed to happen again," said volunteer Gail Edgley, who has been co-ordinating the work.
The modifications to power lines are taking place in areas where the birds have been known to nest or hunt for fishing.
It involves moving the wires further apart, fitting rings on the lines to deter birds and making it harder for them to perch on transformer boxes which supply homes.
Liam O'Sullivan from Scottish Power said: "The death of the osprey in May was the first fatality that I can ever recall in our north Wales district.
"We wanted to act quickly to help to prevent any future incidents."
