The number of billionaires recorded in the list has risen north of the border, from six last year.
The Grant-Gordon whisky family tops the Scottish element of the list with a fortune of £1.9bn.
There are now 104 billionaires based in the UK with a combined wealth of more than £301bn, the list says.
The Grant-Gordon Banffshire distilling family have ousted Mahdi-Al Tajir from the top spot in Scotland.
Al-Tajir, whose interests include a development of luxury homes at Gleneagles, is worth £1.67bn, according to the list.
Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, the siblings who founded the Stagecoach transport empire, have become members of the billionaire club for the first time.
They share a fortune of £1bn - an increase of £270m on last year.
Other Scots on the super-rich list are Sir Ian Wood and family whose £1.32bn fortune comes from oil services and fishing, and the Thomson family, owners of publisher DC Thomson, who are worth £1.2bn.
Former Harrods owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, who owns an estate in the Highlands, is estimated to be worth £1.3bn, while Jim McColl, of engineering business Clyde Blowers has an estimated fortune of £1bn.
