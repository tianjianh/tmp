Super League: Leeds Rhinos 8-0 Salford Red Devils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leeds Rhinos ended a seven-game losing run in league and cup by beating Salford Red Devils in a low-scoring contest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Briscoe put Leeds ahead with his first try of the season before a quiet first period of few chances followed.
Liam Sutcliffe kicked the hosts another two points to extend their lead to 6-0 with just under half-an-hour left.
Salford rarely threatened and were further punished late on when Sutcliffe added another penalty.
The result marked the first time Leeds have won a game since 15 April when they beat Hull FC, the current Super League leaders, 20-18, but they remain rooted to the foot of the table.
Meanwhile, Salford have not won on their travels in their last five league games and stay in 10th place.
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott:
"It's been a while since we last won. We've won because of hard work not because of a dubious refereeing decision or Salford being off.
"There's a lot we can learn from that defensively and take into next week but I'm not sure there's too much offensively.
"I don't think we've got to change anything, we just need to keep being better and as good as we can be.
"I don't think strategically there's anything we need to do. If we can or can't make the top eight, our aim is to be as good as we can be."
Salford head coach Ian Watson:
"We turned over too much ball. They managed the conditions better than we did and deserved the win.
"We just didn't take our opportunities. There was loads of effort and guile from the boys but we just didn't take the opportunities when they presented themselves to us.
"You lose close games when you don't take those opportunities."
