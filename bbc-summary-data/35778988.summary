Jaime Cheesman, then 16, disappeared days after moving from her home in Wellingborough, Northants, to live with a friend in Grimsby in November 1993.
Officers have returned to carry out final tests at the house in Grimsby before it is demolished.
Jaime's father Eric hopes the latest appeal will help him find his daughter.
Northamptonshire Police carried out the initial investigation after her disappearance. Humberside Police are now making a fresh appeal for information about Jamie, who would now be 39.
Police say previous inquiries suggested after Jaime went to Grimsby she may have become involved in a disagreement and left the address. She did not return and she has not been seen since.
The last confirmed sighting of her was on November 2, 1993, when she made a benefit claim in Grimsby.
Mr Cheesman said he would never give up hope of finding his only child.
He said: "A lot of time has gone by, but I am still hopeful.
"There were a few sightings of her in Wellingborough, but that was in the years after she disappeared."
He said a lot had changed since she left, including the deaths of her granddad and mother.
He said there were times he worried that something had happened to her.
"My sister in law sent an article saying a body had been found in a shallow grave in Grimsby. After three days of tests we found out it wasn't Jaime."
He said he hoped the internet and particularly Facebook would boost the latest appeal, adding: "I just want to know that she is alright."
Det Ch Insp Phil Gadd, of Humberside Police, said Jaime may still be in the Grimsby area, or with travellers in either Grimsby or Northamptonshire.
