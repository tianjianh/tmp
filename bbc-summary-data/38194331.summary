The female was seen sitting outside the Outfit store at Morfa Shopping Park, near the Liberty Stadium.
The RSPCA collected her and provided overnight care, before transferring her to a specialist wildlife facility.
It is thought the swan ended up at the spot after a nearby pond froze over on Thursday.
RSPCA animal collection officer Ellie West said: "This poor swan was absolutely exhausted and a little shell-shocked with so many shoppers walking past.
"It is hoped she can be released back to the wild in the near future."
