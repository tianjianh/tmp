Exeter head coach Rob Baxter says his side are capable of beating Clermont Auvergne in the Champions Cup, despite their indifferent start to the season.

Last season's runners-up have won only two of their six games so far ahead of Sunday's meeting with the French side.
"At the moment that's the kind of challenge we need.
"We need to look some big boys in the eye and roll over them, and we've got it in us because we've done it before," Baxter told BBC Radio Devon.
Exeter salvaged a draw with Gloucester on Saturday thanks to a late try, but leading players Jack Nowell, Don Armand, Dave Ewers and Phil Dollman are all injured.
The Chiefs have been beaten by Wasps, Saracens and Northampton this season, only winning against bottom side Bristol and Harlequins.
"At the minute Clermont will probably be rubbing their hands together, they'll be going 'Exeter look OK, but if we turn up with our a game we'll just be able to roll then over'," he added.
"I'm kind of looking forward to it, because it's all very well me telling the players to walk around with their heads up and their chests out and take responsibility and get on, but the first person that has to do that is me, and then the rest of the coaches have to follow suit, and we all have to get through it together.
"If this season ends up being a tough season for us so what, but we're going to face it like men, we're not going to run away from it."
