A police officer, who was hit by automatic gunfire at a petrol station in Belfast, has spoken publicly about the attack.

"I felt something hit me. Everything slowed down," he said. "Blood was pouring out. I thought that was me. I thought I was going to die on that forecourt."
The PSNI officer spoke anonymously as part of an appeal on BBC Crimewatch.
It will show footage of the shooting in January, caught on CCTV.
It will also feature pictures of a red Audi car which police have linked to the attack which happened on 22 January on Belfast's Crumlin Road.
It was later found burned out at Culmore Gardens, Andersonstown, in west Belfast.
The officer was hit at least twice in his right arm, and it is thought a bullet-proof vest may have saved his life.
Det Supt Kevin Geddes said he would be revealing "new pieces of information" during the fresh appeal on Crimewatch.
"The programme will also feature my colleague speaking about his ordeal publicly for the first time," he added.
"He will bravely describe the moments leading up to the attack, his thoughts and feelings on realising he had been shot and injured, and also describe his road to recovery."
At the time, police said their main line of inquiry was "violent dissident republicans".
Crimewatch is on BBC 1 on Monday 6 March at 21:00 GMT.
