Doors Open Day, on Saturday 24 September, will see the vintage vehicles running between Lothian Road and Newhaven.
The buses will travel along the number 16 route with a stop at Lothian Buses central depot in Annandale Street.
Passengers will then be able to see behind the scenes at the central depot.
Doors to the depot will be open between 12:00 and 16:00.
However, the vintage buses will be running every 10 minutes between 09:00 and 18:00, passengers will be able to travel on a fleet of vintage buses along Princes Street, St Andrew Square, York Place and Leith Walk to Newhaven.
Normal Lothian Buses fares will be accepted on the vintage vehicles.
At the depot there will be a display of new and vintage buses and people will be able to sit on a double-decker bus while it goes through a bus wash.
Richard Hall, Lothian Buses managing director, said: "We are really excited to be able to offer trips on vintage buses as part of our Doors Open Day programme this year.
"We hope that by giving people this rare opportunity to travel back in time on these special services, it will add to what is already a very popular event in Edinburgh."
The event will also have face painting, a bouncy castle and the chance to sit in the bus drivers seat.
