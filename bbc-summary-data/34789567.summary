[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucester incinerator work 'to begin next summer'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Work on a Â£500m waste incinerator near Gloucester is set to begin next summer after the county council voted to allow a developer to begin construction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme at Javelin Park has been delayed for three years due to a series of legal challenges from campaigners.
Gloucestershire County Council's Conservative cabinet voted unanimously to approve a revised contract, allowing Urbaser Balfour Beatty to build the plant.
It is expected to open in 2019.
Plans for the project were approved by the secretary of state in January, following a public inquiry, despite the plans having been previously refused by Gloucestershire County Council.
A further legal challenge at the High Court by Stroud District Council in July failed to get the decision overturned.
