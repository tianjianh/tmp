County Championship: Middlesex struggle against Sussex

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dawid Malan fell just short of a century for Middlesex, but it was Sussex who ended day one as the happier team at Lord's.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The left-hander top scored with 93 before being caught by Ben Brown off the bowling of Oliver Robinson as the home side were all out for 234.
Robinson and Chris Liddle each took three wickets, but Steve Magoffin was the pick of the bowlers with 4-48.
In reply, Sussex lost Ed Joyce for 12 before closing on 33-1.
The visitors began the day with six fast bowlers unavailable, as Chris Jordan and Matt Hobden joined their injury list, but rose to the challenge as they pinned down the home side, who never really got going.
Malan was the only player to pass 50, with Nick Compton Middlesex's next highest scorer with 39.
Their stand of 90 was the mainstay of the innings after the early loss of openers Sam Robson and Nick Gubbins, but when Compton was caught at second slip that heralded a slump from 114-2 to 123-6.
Malan put on 55 with Ollie Rayner to calm the home side's fears, but when Rayner was out for 28 two balls after tea, the innings lost momentum. After Malan's dismissal, Toby Roland-Jones added 16 and Tim Murtagh 13, with Ravi Patel unbeaten on six.
Sussex reached 33-1 off 16 overs before the close and will have ended the day the happier team.
