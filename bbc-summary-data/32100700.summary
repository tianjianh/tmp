The 34-year-old from Sheffield earned a commanding 3-0 win over German Simon Rosner in the final.
Matthew beat the world number nine 11-4, 11-9, 11-7 to become the first man since Ramy Ashour in 2013 to win three consecutive tournaments.
"It's just amazing to win this title for a fifth time and I'm going to enjoy it tonight," said Matthew.
His victory in the Canary Wharf Classic followed him winning the Swedish Open and Windy City Open titles.
