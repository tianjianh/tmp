People from all walks of life watched the sun rise at 04:52 BST and there was a carnival atmosphere among many revellers.
Wiltshire Police said the celebrations were "positive and peaceful", with many people taking photographs and videos of the event.
Some even participated in yoga to celebrate the summer solstice and International Yoga Day.
Some people managed to take a great picture of the beautifully coloured sky over the stones.
The summer solstice usually occurs on 21 June, but can occur on 20 and 22 June. Next year's summer solstice will occur on 20 June.
The festival, which dates back thousands of years, celebrates the longest day of the year when the sun is at its maximum elevation and usually has a real party atmosphere.
Modern druids and people gather at Stonehenge every year to see the sun rise on the first morning of summer, including these brightly coloured revellers in costume.
Some people even touch the Stonehenge stones as part of the celebrations.
