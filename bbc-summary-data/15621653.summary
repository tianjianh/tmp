Chelsea pair Fernando Torres and Juan Mata, Manchester City's David Silva and Jose Reina of Liverpool could all line up against club-mates at Wembley.
Former Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas makes a return to London as part of an experienced 23-man squad named by coach Vicente del Bosque.
Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta has been recalled after a hamstring injury.
Del Bosque has selected the majority of players who helped the world and European champions to their two major titles.
Iniesta, who scored the winner when Spain last visited England in 2007, missed last month's Euro 2012 qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Scotland.
Sevilla winger Jesus Navas has been recalled to the squad, with Malaga full-back Nacho Monreal also included.
Del Bosque said: "Before submitting the squad list for the Euros we have only three (more) games.
"There will be some games to come after the squad get together, but we have to make the most of these matches.
"England are a great team, and we will be playing in an extraordinary stadium.
"We tailor these games to be the best they can be for the team and for the federation."
After facing England, Spain travel to Costa Rica on November 15 for another friendly.
