The 19-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract with the German team, scored in the 3-1 victory over Leeds United on Saturday.
It was the youth team team product's fourth goal for Forest this season.
Burke's fee surpasses the £12m Aston Villa paid Fulham for Scottish striker Ross McCormack earlier this month.
Sporting director Ralf Rangnick told his club website: "He is an outstanding talent with an awful lot of potential."
Burke made his Forest debut in September 2014 and earned his first international cap against Denmark in March this year.
Rangnick added: "He fits with the high pace and way of playing very well and will make his next sporting development step with us.
"This transfer is important, especially because several top clubs were interested."
