A Playboy model who apologised for taking a nude photo of an older woman at a gym has pleaded not guilty to a charge of invasion of privacy.

Dani Mathers, 29, faced public outrage after she shared a photo of a naked 70-year-old woman on Snapchat in July.
But a lawyer for Ms Mathers, who did not attend the hearing, said she "very much regrets" the incident.
If convicted on the misdemeanour charge, she could face up to six months in jail and a $1,000 (Â£805) fine.
The nude photo, which Ms Mathers appeared to share without the woman's consent, included the caption: "If I can't unsee this then you can't either."
The gym, LA Fitness, reported the Snapchat post to police and terminated her membership.
Ms Mathers later apologised after uploading the image, saying she thought her Snapchat post had been a private conversation and acknowledging that "body-shaming" is wrong.
"She apologised for her behaviour and we're looking forward to resolving this case in a very fair manner," said Tom Mesereau, Ms Mather's lawyer.
The Los Angeles Police Department began investigating the incident after receiving a report of "illegal distribution" of the image, according to police Captain Andrew Neiman.
"Her behaviour is appalling and puts every member at risk of losing their privacy," Jill Greuling, an LA Fitness executive vice-president, said at the time.
Ms Mathers, who was Playmate of the Year in 2015, has since lost her job on a radio show and faced widespread criticism online.
A pre-trial hearing is set for 21 December.
