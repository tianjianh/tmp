The 37-year-old, who had spells at Hearts and Dundee United, has not played since leaving Czech Republic side Blada Moleslav in March.
Former Aberdeen and Morton striker Declan McManus has also signed a loan deal at the Kirkcaldy club.
McManus, 21, signed for Fleetwood Town last year but has seen his appearances in the first team limited.
"It's really tremendous that we have been able to bring in players of the quality of Declan and Rudi," chairman Allan Young told the Raith Rovers website.
