[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Long, 75, secretly squirted almost 200 children, some of whom were under the age of 13, with the mixture.
He took photos of his victims before and after spraying their clothes, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Long was jailed for six years and eight months after admitting 13 charges of sexual touching.
Long, formerly of Forest Road, Loughborough, targeted young girls in Nottingham city centre.
The court heard a police search of Long's home recovered journals and scrapbooks containing photos of victims taken between 2003 and 2016.
In the journals, Long detailed his sexual fantasies regarding what he had done, police said.
He was put on the sex offenders register and made subject to a 10-year sexual harm prevention order.
Det Ch Insp Peter Quinn, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Long showed extraordinary levels of perversion and we're pleased he has been jailed for his sickening acts.ã€€
"The investigation was unable to identify every person affected by Long's actions and there will be people out there who do not know that they have been a victim of his criminality.
"I wish to reassure the public however that every reasonable step has been taken to ensure that Long's actions have placed no-one's health at risk and I am satisfied that this is the case."
Long pleaded guilty to 13 charges of sexually touching three identified children and 10 unidentified children under and over 13 years of age.
He asked for a further 186 incidents of the same offence to be taken into account and admitted making hundreds of indecent and pseudo-indecent images of children.
