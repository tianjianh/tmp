Rea, 29, dominated last year's championship as he took 14 wins in his first season with the Kawasaki team.
The Northern Irishman has a 35-point lead in this year's championship.
"Our objectives and way of working are very well matched so it makes perfect sense to extend this for two more seasons," said Rea.
