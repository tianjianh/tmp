The national emergency co-ordination group said a further 230 properties were under threat while 130 houses have been marooned.
Met Ã‰ireann has issued a yellow warning for Cork and Kerry with up to 40mm of rain forecast to fall there on Sunday and into the evening.
Local authorities in many counties are monitoring river levels.
The Clonmel Flood Response team took the decision to evacuate homes in the Kilganey area of Clonmel in County Tipperary because of the high water level in the River Suir.
Brendan McGrath, from the national emergency co-ordination group, said the situation in Clonmel was "very much on a knife edge".
"The critical level there is four metres, the river, the last report I had was 3.79 metres, so again that is being monitored," he said.
"There are contingency arrangements in place."
Flood alerts remain in place in some regions close to rivers, including the Shannon and Suir.
Flood defences have been strengthened in Fermoy and Mallow in Cork and in other areas of the country.
The Irish defence forces are assisting in the flood prevention operations and have been helping some residents to operate pumps to prevent more flooding at their homes.
About 110 members have been deployed across the Republic of Ireland to help with relief efforts, with more on standby.
