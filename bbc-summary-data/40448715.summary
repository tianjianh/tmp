But the 32-year-old is expected to be fit in time for Swansea's Premier League opener at Southampton on Saturday, 12 August.
The Welsh club says the Spaniard's pre-season training programme will be adjusted because of his injury.
Llorente was Swansea's top scorer last season with 15 goals from 33 games.
