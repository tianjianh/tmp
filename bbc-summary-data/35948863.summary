The visitors, now just a point above the bottom four in 20th, led at half-time through on-loan Larnell Cole.
But Millwall then scored twice in four minutes through Ben Thompson's 25-yard volley and a Steve Morison header.
Lee Gregory completed victory with a late penalty after being fouled by Town keeper Mark Halstead, who was sent off.
Millwall, unbeaten at home in six games, are fourth and seven points behind Burton in second, but are the same margin clear of Barnsley in seventh.
Millwall boss Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"I can change the shape, I can change the team, but it's down to the players at the end of the day.
"I said to the boys 'Go and express yourself in the second half. We've got to be brave and get on the ball'.
"First half, we were too direct, too long, we needed the extra pass. Second half, we were excellent."
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"We did well in the first half, but in the second half we didn't tough it out. We got caught at the edge of the box with a volley, then we lost another sloppy goal from a set play.
"You have to commit and win the individual battles, otherwise you will concede goals and we didn't win enough of those battles.
"The manner in which we have lost is difficult to tactically pull apart but, as individuals, we have to do our jobs better."
