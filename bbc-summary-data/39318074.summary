[SN]TITLE[SN]
Torino 2-2 Inter Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England goalkeeper Joe Hart made two costly errors as Torino drew with Inter Milan in Serie A.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hart, who is on a season-long loan from Manchester City, allowed Geoffrey Kondogbia's shot to slip under his body as Inter took the lead on 27 minutes.
Daniele Baselli and Afriyie Acquah put Torino ahead before Hart contributed to Inter's 62nd-minute equaliser.
The 29-year-old misjudged Cristian Ansaldi's cross, allowing Antonio Candreva to score from close range.
The draw leaves Inter in fifth place, five points behind third-placed Napoli, who fill the final Champions League spot.
Napoli face Empoli on Sunday, while leaders Juventus are at Sampdoria, and Roma, in second, host Sassuolo.
In Saturday's other match, AC Milan beat Genoa 1-0 to move up to sixth, with Matias Fernandez scoring the only goal.
