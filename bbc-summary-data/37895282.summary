Truro City boss Lee Hodges says he is "angry" after his side suffered another second-half collapse as they lost 4-2 at Ebbsfleet in National League South.

Niall Thompson's goal just before half-time made it 1-1 at the break, but the White Tigers conceded three times in 10 minutes to go 4-1 down before Andrew Neal's late consolation goal.
"I'm so angry as I felt we could have seen it out," Hodges told BBC Cornwall.
"It would have been a fantastic performance."
The loss was Truro's fifth game without a win - they have now won just once in their last nine league and cup matches.
City had Durrell Berry making his debut after the former Torquay United full-back signed on non-contract terms as he ups his recovery from a broken ankle.
"The effort was there, the commitment was there, but when that second goal goes in there's a weakness about us and I don't like it," added Hodges,
"I want players to help us and if one misses the ball the next one should get him out of trouble, but at the moment it just seems that once we go under a little bit we're not helping each other out.
"But I've got that fighting spirit, I'll keep going and keep fighting and I want the boys to be with me to keep fighting as well."
