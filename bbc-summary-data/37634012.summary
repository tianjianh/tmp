MP calls for jail terms for stalking to be doubled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-minute bill to double the maximum sentencing on stalking has been introduced by the Cheltenham MP, Alex Chalk.

Mr Chalk told MPs the maximum five years was "wholly inadequate" as it was a "horrible, violating crime" that "shatters lives".
He added: "All too often it's a gateway to serious violence."
The bill was adopted by the House without any opposition and will now get a second reading on 28 October.
In the Commons on Wednesday, the Cheltenham MP said he had been inspired to act by constituent Dr Eleanor Aston, who he said had suffered "a horrific ordeal" for seven years at the hands of a former patient.
Mr Chalk called stalking a "horrible, violating crime" that "shatters lives".
He added: "Despite it being such a violating, intrusive crime, despite it having the capacity to do such significant physical and mental harm, it's still being treated as a minor offence. That won't do."
MPs heard that Dr Aston's stalker, Raymond Knight, had turned up at her surgery more than 100 times, posted "foul items" though her letterbox, followed her on patient visits, slashed her tyres and sent threatening emails.
MPs heard that after being jailed for a first time, Knight resumed his activities once he had been released from prison, when Dr Aston received packages at home and at work.
Knight sent one saying he knew where Dr Aston's children went to school, another package stated, "guess who's back".
When police arrested Knight again, they found he had searched online for the term "how long after a person disappears are they assumed dead".
The judge who sentenced Knight for a second time last year admitted he was dangerous, expressing his own frustration he could not hand Knight a longer sentence, MPs heard.
The Conservative politician also said the five-year maximum sentence for someone pleading guilty would in practice serve between 18 and 20 months.
The bill will need the support of Government to become law.
