Shane Warne wants England to be patient with Adil Rashid

Leg-spin legend Shane Warne was impressed with England's Adil Rashid after he spent time working with him in training on Friday, ahead of Sunday's third Test against Pakistan in Sharjah.

Warne had spent time with Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah the previous day.
"Rashid's got all the tools - he's a wonderful bowler and he's got a beautiful leg-break," said Warne.
"If you're patient with Rashid, I think you'll get the best out of him and see a wonderful leg-spin bowler."
England need to win the third and final Test to avoid a series defeat, but will be without paceman Mark Wood who is rested because of an ankle injury.
Rashid had a mixed time in the drawn first Test in Abu Dhabi, taking 0-163 - the worst figures by a Test debutant - in the first innings before capturing 5-64 in the second innings, the first five-wicket haul by an English leg-spinner since 1959.
The Yorkshire player then took 1-84 and 1-107 as England lost the second Test in Dubai.
"What we've seen from Rashid is some glimpses of what he can do at this level, it's about being consistent," explained Warne, who took 195 of his 708 Test wickets against England before retiring in 2007.
"On spinning pitches, expectations are that he's going to come in, rip them and take five-for straight away.
"But when you start Test cricket, it's hard work. You're going to bowl a bit of rubbish, a few full tosses and half-trackers, and get whacked - it's then about how you come back for that second spell.
"There were some things that I worked on with Rashid which I think will be able to help him against the Pakistan players, and there were a few things I helped Yasir with yesterday which I'm sure will help against England!
"Yasir is probably the best leg-spinner in the world, but Rashid can be just as successful."
After missing the first Test with injury, Yasir took match figures of 8-180 in the second Test as Pakistan won by 178 runs.
That took his tally in Test cricket to 69 wickets in only 11 matches.
In his role as a Sky Sports commentator, Warne has been a persistent critic of England skipper Alastair Cook's captaincy, particularly during the back-to-back Ashes series in 2013 and 2013-14.
But Warne insisted the pair had made peace, explaining: "A while ago - about 18 months ago - we had a chat on the phone and sorted it all out.
"It's my job as a commentator to say what I see. It doesn't mean I'm right, but it's my job to do that. I can't sit on the fence and just say the nice things.
"I don't think anybody is the best captain when they start. We've seen Cookie grow, we've seen him bat well and captain well, and he captained very well in the [2015] Ashes."
