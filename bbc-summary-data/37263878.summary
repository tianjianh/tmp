Heart of Midlothian 3-1 Hamilton Academical

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Walker's double helped Hearts come from behind to beat Hamilton Academical in the Scottish Premiership.

Accies exposed Hearts' frailties early in the second period with Ali Crawford converting Grant Gillespie's driven cross.
But Walker headed home Sam Nicholson's delivery to level matters.
Nicholson then won a penalty, which Walker tucked away, and Nicholson fired a late third to secure the three points for Hearts.

Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning admits he is surprised that Crawford is still at Hamilton, given the accomplishment of his technique and creative ability. The midfielder reminded again that his poise and instincts are vital to Hamilton's fortunes.
Crawford nominally began on the left of a four-man midfield, but he drifted into pockets of space with menacing intent, and was a key supporter of lone striker Alexandre D'Acol.
Crawford's finish for his goal was typically assured, precisely steering a volley into the corner of the net from Gillespie's centre. It was a measure of the game, though, that his strike, in the 50th minute, was not only Hamilton's first shot on target but their first meaningful effort of the game.
Hearts had been haunted by a series of regrets. They were the dominant side in the first half and created a number of chances, but by half-time were left to rue their failure to convert them.
Callum Paterson managed four attempts on goal, with one deflected wide, one header wide and another over, then a rasping 25-yard shot that flew just over the bar.
Conor Sammon ought to have scored but side-footed wide, while Walker struck the post after the interval. Even after the equaliser, Hearts' pressure delivered more frustration, with Paterson's header cleared off the line by Hamilton centre-back Georgios Sarris.
Winger Walker was not prepared to allow the game to slip away from Hearts. On his return to the side for the first time in the league since a dive against Celtic last month led to a two-game ban, he finally delivered the telling touch with a crisply-taken header from Nicholson's cross.
The introduction of Nicholson as a substitute made a difference, not only because of his liveliness and direct running, but also because it freed up Walker to move into the centre of the field and be more influential.
It was Nicholson who won the penalty that led to the winning goal, too, being brought down by Hamilton substitute Shaun Want. Walker calmly converted.
There was still a moment of alarm for the home side, though, when Hamilton's Dougie Imrie went down inside the penalty area, but referee Craig Thomson ruled out a spot-kick.
Nicholson then completed the scoring with a far-post volley in time added on.
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: "We knew it was going to be [hard-fought]. We knew we'd have to be at our best. They scored a goal and put us under a lot of pressure. The quality eventually came through, which we were pleased with.
"I'm a distance away [from the Nicholson penalty]. The [Hamilton] player goes in, he's off the ground, and [Nicholson] goes down, so it's a penalty. The referee's made a decision and it looks like there's real contact, so you have to accept and back the referee's decision.
"[Walker] is a top player. He's struggled to get back into the team because Nicholson's done so well, but I'm lucky I've got real quality. [Robbie] Muirhead came on, Bjorn [Johnsen] came on and turned the game for us and we need that quality."
Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning: "I thought we performed well, worked hard and frustrated Hearts at times.
"I don't think it's a penalty, having seen it back. The boys are saying the player himself said he was off balance and had no option but to go down, but didn't feel it was a penalty. It's frustrating when these decisions go against you.
"I thought there was contact [in the box on Imrie], Dougie's cut in and the boy's stepped across him. I'll never criticise a referee publicly because it's such a hard job. They get split-seconds to see it and they've got to make a judgement call. You just hope that over the course of the season it evens itself out."
