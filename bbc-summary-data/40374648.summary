Hillsborough disaster: Charges decision due on 28 June

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A decision on whether individuals and organisations will face criminal charges over the Hillsborough disaster will be announced next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Crown Prosecution Service said it would reveal its decisions on 28 June.
Relatives of the 96 football fans who were fatally injured in the 1989 stadium disaster will be informed at a meeting at about 11:00 BST.
Jurors at the new inquests into the tragedy in Sheffield concluded the fans had been unlawfully killed.
In January, files of evidence relating to 23 suspects were referred to the CPS to decide whether charges should be brought.
Of these, 15 relate to the Operation Resolve investigation into the causes of the disaster at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
The other eight relate to an Independent Police Complaints Commission probe into the conduct of both South Yorkshire Police and West Midlands Police in the days and weeks that followed the tragedy.
Relatives of the 96 have been invited to a private meeting in Warrington, where they will be informed of the decisions by Sue Hemming, head of the special crime and counter-terrorism division at the CPS.
