The 12 June event will see the 37-year-old actor return to New York's Beacon Theatre, where he won the Tony for best leading actor in a play in 2012 for his performance in One Man, Two Guvnors.
Since then, he has had more success as the host of CBS's The Late Late Show.
The organisers of the Tonys called him "the ideal choice" to host what they said would be an "unforgettable show".
"James is one of those rare performers whose gifts translate perfectly to both the Broadway stage and the television screen," said Charlotte St Martin, president of the Broadway League, and Heather Hitchens, president of the American Theatre Wing, in a statement.
"The last time he was at the Tonys, he went home with one. We think he'll have even more fun as host."
"We are thrilled to have James Corden not only as a member of the CBS family, but as host of this year's Tony Awards," said Jack Sussman of CBS Entertainment.
"James is the ultimate performer... and the perfect choice to host this prestigious and always entertaining live television event."
Corden's other roles include Smithy in BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey, Timms in the stage and film versions of The History Boys, and The Baker in the 2014 film of Into the Woods.
Kristin Chenoweth and Alan Cumming co-hosted last year's Tonys, following in the footsteps of Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.
