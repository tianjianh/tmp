A Scottish self-storage firm is set to expand, citing increased demand as a result of a "difficult property market during the recession".

Kangaroo Self Storage plans to create hundreds of extra units at its Glasgow site and invest in its Dundee facility.
Kangaroo said it had benefited from a rise in the number of householders moving back home to live with their parents during the recession.
It also cited students increasingly using storage rooms over the summer.
Work is due to start this year on expanding its Glasgow centre from 588 storage rooms to more than 940.
Kangaroo, which is based in Haddington, East Lothian, said it would also "put the building blocks in place" for new storage developments, after securing Â£3.8m in funding from HSBC bank.
Managing director Chris Stevens said: "As a result of a difficult property market during the recession, we've seen increased demand across all the sectors, with the number of householders moving back home to live with their parents, businesses taking advantage of the flexibility of our storage space in uncertain times and students increasingly using storage rooms over the summer holidays."
