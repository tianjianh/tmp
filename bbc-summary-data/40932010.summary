[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 2-0 Hull City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers inflicted a third straight defeat on a much-changed Hull City to knock them out of the EFL Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hull manager Leonid Slutsky made 11 changes to his side, handing six players their senior debuts against League One side Rovers.
The visitors held firm until half-time, but Alfie May opened the scoring with an accurate finish from 15 yards.
Tommy Rowe made it 2-0 soon after with a drilled shot, while Ben Whiteman and May also hit the woodwork for Rovers.
Hull's injury problems were a hindrance to Slutsky following Championship defeats by Wolves and Queens Park Rangers and his starting line-up had amassed just six starts for the club between them.
The young Tigers side fought well until May smashed in his fourth goal in as many games shortly after half-time and Rowe quickly produced a similarly accurate finish.
The League One side had much the better of the opportunities and could have won by a wider margin, with Hull mustering just a single attempt on target.
