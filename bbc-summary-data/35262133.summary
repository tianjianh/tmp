A chemical spill at a school sealed off a street in Perth on Thursday night.

One litre of formalin, a formaldehyde-based chemical, was spilled in a classroom at St John's RC Academy, which is part of the North Inch Community Campus.
The fire, police and ambulance services all attended the scene, after a call was made at about 18:15
A spokesman for Perth and Kinross Council confirmed that no-one had been hurt in the incident.
He said that no pupils were in the building at the time as it was out of normal school hours, and that although there had been some "accidental damage", the school was opened as normal on Friday.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) sent two appliances from Perth fire station (including a heavy rescue unit) and an appliance from Dunkeld.
SFRS crews in breathing apparatus and gas tight suits cleared up the spill, which they soon identified as formalin - a chemical traditionally used for embalming bodies, and as an agricultural cleaner.
Fire station manager Bob Rearie, who was at the scene, said that the school had been evacuated and a cordon had been put in place as a precaution.
He explained that two cleaners had attempted to clean up the spill and were overcome with the fumes. They were checked by medics but did not require hospital treatment.
Mr Rearie said the area had been made safe and a cordon would remain in place until the area was cleaned and the materials removed.
He said the spillage would not affect the environment and that there was no risk to the public.
