Each event will focus on specific sectors including forestry, fish farming and food and drink.
The discussions will be hosted by Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing.
They will bring together industry representatives to recommend action to boost investment and consider how to protect interests with the EU.
Mr Ewing said: "I want to drive forward the rural economy and there are a number of sectors which have a crucial role to play in this.
"That's why I am hosting a series of summits to bring together key players, identify the barriers to growth and recommend potential actions to increase investment and boost jobs.
"Clearly our place in Europe is a key issue when it comes to our economy, and our rural economy in particular.
"That is why we are working to maintain our relationship with the EU, and how we can best protect Scotland's interests will be an important part of the discussions at each of our summits."
The first summit in the series will be held on Thursday and will focus on the farmed shellfish sector.
