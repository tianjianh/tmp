East Anglia devolution: Proposal splits counties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A revised devolution plan for East Anglia showed the region would be split between Cambridgeshire/Peterborough and Norfolk/Suffolk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norfolk and Suffolk were originally pushing for a three county deal, but Cambridgeshire/Peterborough objected.
The proposal would create two Combined Authority with budgets for economic growth.
The government's aim is to create the new authorities with mayoral elections in May.
Andy Wood, who has been chairman of the regional devolution group, said: "The main focus of all our discussions has been to ensure we got the best possible settlement for the people of East Anglia.
"Government has recognised the importance of East Anglia to the economy, and the different needs and opportunities of its town and cities.
"Through productive negotiations we have been able to secure more funding for East Anglia than was in the original deal."
The government's original proposed annual budget was £175m for housing and £30m for infrastructure for the three counties.
Local councils and the Local Enterprise Partnerships need to endorse the proposal ahead of public consultation in July and August.
The government would consider the results of the consultation ahead of creating the two combined authorities with mayoral elections to follow.
