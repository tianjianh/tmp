Celebrity fans of the actress Zsa Zsa Gabor have shared tributes online after her death at the age of 99.

Gabor was the quintessential Hollywood bombshell in her 1950s heyday - nine times married, and hilarious with it.
Socialite Paris Hilton - the great granddaughter of Gabor's second husband Conrad Hilton - posted a photo of the couple with a tribute:
"Sad to hear the news of Zsa Zsa Gabor's passing. My great grandfather and her made such a beautiful couple."
Burlesque icon Dita Von Teese shared a beautiful black and white shot on Instagram, writing: "Another Hollywood legend has left us, the glamorous Zsa Zsa Gabor, one of the wittiest beauties of all time!"
"I love all her hilarious quotes about love, but this one is a favourite: 'Being jealous of a beautiful woman is not going to make you more beautiful'."
Hollywood actor Antonio Banderas also chose a winsome black and white picture, captioned simply: "RIP" with the hashtag #Zsazsagabor
US chat show host Larry King said of the star: "There will only be one Zsa Zsa Gabor. And I liked her a lot. Rest In Peace, my dear."
Actress Barbara Eden, who starred in 1960s sitcom I Dream of Jeannie, tweeted: "Rest in peace Zsa Zsa Gabor. She and her sisters were lovely ladies who were always fun and delightful to be around."
Game of Thrones actress Gwendoline Christie called the socialite "fabulous" and "unmistakable", making the point with a picture of Gabor posing in a giant confection of a hat.
She also posted a link to a 1994 sketch where comic and TV host David Letterman drove Gabor around in a soft-top car ordering huge amounts of fast food.
The star, then in her late 70s, is seen cackling delightedly over McDonalds drive-thru fries, before visiting a range of other eateries including KFC, Burger King, and Taco Bell.
Joking about her age, Letterman tells a server: "You ever see that Jurassic Park movie? She used to have those animals as pets!" - at which the perfectly-coiffed Gabor falls about laughing.
British director Michael Winner, who worked with Gabor on the 1976 film Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood, once said her greatest role was playing herself.
Speaking before his death in 2013, he remarked: "She played Zsa Zsa Gabor the actress in real life.
"I thought she had great wit and charm. She was a perfectly reasonable actress. Not a great actress - but she was perfect in those early comedies.
"She played a glamorous Hungarian. She wouldn't have been able to play Juliet, or be in Hamlet, but was perfect for those films.
"Her private life is the equal to those characters in soap operas today - but they do not hold a candle to her. Compared to Zsa Zsa Gabor they are just empty shells."
