[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sentence of Moray drink-drive death crash motorist reduced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drink-driver who got behind the wheel because he was "fed up waiting for a taxi" then crashed and killed his friend has had his jail sentence cut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murray Geddes, from Aberlour in Moray, admitted causing the death of passenger Graeme McKenzie, 37, by driving dangerously on the A941 Craigellachie to Rothes road in May last year.
Appeal judges have reduced the sentence from nine years to six.
His driving ban was also reduced to eight years from 12.
The appeal judges heard that Geddes, 37, had accepted responsibility for the death and shown genuine remorse.
Geddes told police after the fatal crash that he had taken his Audi S3 from the pub because he was fed up waiting for a taxi.
Mr McKenzie, an offshore worker from Rothes, was thrown from the vehicle.
A motorist who was overtaken by Geddes later said: "I would say it was like a speed demon."
A witness saw the car fail to negotiate a bend and leave the road. It became airborne and spun three times.
Offshore driller Geddes had a speeding conviction from March for driving at 93mph in a 60mph zone on the A96 near Huntly.
