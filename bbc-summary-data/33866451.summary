Rob Walton, 36, from Hinckley in Leicestershire, was hit while swimming off the coast of Labenne, in south-west France, where he was on holiday with his family.
Mr Walton played in the lock position at Championship-level in Birmingham, Rotherham and Coventry before becoming player-coach at Rugby Lions.
Friends said he was a "gentle giant".
The accident happened at about 14:00 BST on Monday.
Friends said Mr Walton, a father-of-four, was swimming off the coast when he was hit by a "freak" wave.
Mr Walton grew up in Stoke Golding, near Hinckley, and played junior and senior rugby at Hinckley Rugby Club before moving to Birmingham - now Birmingham and Solihull - Rotherham and Coventry.
He was part of the Birmingham side - then known as the Pertemps Bees - that famously beat London Wasps in the 2004 Powergen Cup quarter-final.
After playing the sport in New Zealand alongside two future All Blacks - Chris Jack and Dan Carter - and having a second stint in Hinckley, he moved into coaching, guiding the Rugby Lions to two successive promotions.
Steve Avent, fixtures secretary at Hinckley, said he felt "so sorry" for Mr Walton's family.
"Everyone is devastated," he said. "I have known him since he was 10 years old and he's such a nice lad.
"He played rugby at a high level - he was a gentle giant, really. You wouldn't think something like this was possible."
"The flag at the club is flying at half-mast and there is no doubt we will have some sort of remembrance for him," he said.
Fellow player-coach Rob Dignum said he did not know how the club would "fill the void".
"He had a heart of gold and friends all over the world," he said.
