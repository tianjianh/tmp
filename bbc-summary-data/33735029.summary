The 19-year-old, who can play at right-back or centre-back, is yet to make his senior debut for the Whites.
The Northern Ireland international will be with the Reds until 27 August.
"With Lanre Oyebanjo out until October we need cover in the right-back position and Liam is a player we have had on our radar for a while," Crawley boss Mark Yates told the club website.
Donnelly, who began his career with Dungannon Swifts, becomes Crawley's 10th signing of the summer transfer window.
