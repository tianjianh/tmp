Japanese grapes auction: Ruby Romans fetch record price

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bunch of grapes has sold for a record-breaking $11,000 (Â£8,500) in Japan, where fruit often commands high prices and social prestige.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A supermarket owner from western Japan walked away with 30 grapes, each worth about $360.
They were the first Ruby Romans - a super sweet grape variety grown in Ishikawa prefecture - of the season.
"We will display them at our store before giving our customers a sample taste," Takamaru Konishi said.
The Japanese are often willing to pay top-dollar for premium samples of fruit, sometimes with the intention of giving them as gifts to people perceived to be of higher status - for example, their boss at work.
A single apple can cost up to $3. And melons are sometimes sold for the equivalent price of a vintage wine.
Last year a pair of melons sold under the hammer for more than $12,000.
"I am so happy and I am honoured," Mr Konishi said.
"These are truly Ruby Roman gems."
