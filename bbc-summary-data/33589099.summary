Manchester United: Louis van Gaal happy with attacking options

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United are ready to gamble on the fitness of striker Wayne Rooney, and may not bring in any more forwards.

Javier Hernandez and James Wilson are the only other true strikers left after Robin van Persie joined Fenerbahce and Radamel Falcao's loan ended.
Boss Louis van Gaal is considering using Rooney as a sole striker with support coming from summer signing Memphis Depay behind him.
However, Van Gaal did not rule out "a surprise" signing.
Following Friday night's friendly win over Club America, he said: "I am not worried about depth of forwards. We still have Rooney. He can play in the striker's position. Last year the media said he had to play there. I listen to the media.
"We also have [Javier] Hernandez, [James] Wilson and maybe a surprise, you never know. It is a process."
Despite spending Â£83.1m on four players so far this summer, the club have not ruled out another big-money signing.
Rooney, 29, has been relatively injury-free over the past two seasons. On both occasions he was United's top league scorer with 14 and 17 goals respectively.
The last time he was used extensively as the club's main forward was during the 2009-10 season, when he scored 34 goals - the best tally of his career so far.
Depay, 21, could be played in a more central attacking spot than the wider role he usually occupied at PSV Eindhoven, Van Gaal has said.
He played behind Rooney in the number 10 role in the opening match of his side's US tour against Club America.
Hernandez is now likely to be the main back-up to Rooney, which is a surprise as his United career looked over when he went on loan to Real Madrid last season.
The Mexican, 27, is currently sidelined with a broken collarbone that ruled him out of his country's Gold Cup campaign.
A similar role has been earmarked for 19-year-old Wilson, who did not make the progress anticipated last season after scoring twice on his debut against Hull in May 2014.
