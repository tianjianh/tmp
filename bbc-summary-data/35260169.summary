Hertfordshire Police said investigations were continuing but no-one else is believed to have been involved and it will continue to work closely with the school.
School head Gary Lewis said an "altercation" had occurred between two year nine boys at the end of school on the afternoon of Wednesday, with no one else involved.
"The incident resulted in one of the students being punched," he said.
"Unfortunately, this student is now being treated in hospital for a head injury and his condition is currently causing serious concern.
"Our thoughts are very much with the student, his family and friends and we are doing everything possible to support everyone involved.
"The police are currently investigating the incident and therefore it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time."
