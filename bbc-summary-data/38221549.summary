Sammy Lee has left his position as England assistant manager.

The 57-year-old was appointed as Sam Allardyce's assistant in July and kept the role following the manager's sacking and during Gareth Southgate's subsequent time as interim boss.
Southgate was given a four-year deal by the Football Association last Wednesday and decided against keeping Lee.
"I felt it was important for me to bring in my own support team and Sammy fully respected that," Southgate said.
Former Liverpool midfielder and coach Lee had a short spell with the England set-up under Sven-Goran Eriksson and then joined Bolton in 2005, briefly managing the Trotters in 2007 before returning to the Reds as assistant manager to Rafael Benitez.
Lee returned to Bolton in 2012 where he was head of academy coaching and development, before joining the Southampton coaching staff in 2014.

Sammy Lee's departure from the England coaching staff was inevitable once Gareth Southgate was confirmed as full-time manager.
Lee was very much part of the package that came with Sam Allardyce's appointment, despite the fact he was by Southgate's side for his four games in interim charge, and his future was always in doubt once the manager he worked with at Bolton Wanderers left the job after only 67 days.
He is very much an FA loyalist having had a short spell on the backroom staff with Sven-Goran Eriksson but Southgate has formed a close bond with Chelsea coach Steve Holland, who worked with him for England Under-21s and during his temporary tenure.
The likelihood is that Holland will continue to serve England on a part-time basis while maintaining his role with Chelsea before moving to join up with Southgate permanently in the international set-up at the end of the season.
