Phil Simmons: West Indies reinstate coach after he apologises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Indies have reinstated Phil Simmons as head coach of their senior squads after he apologised for criticising team selection.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simmons, 52, was suspended in September for questioning the continued omissions of Dwayne Bravo and Kieron Pollard.
He issued a public apology to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB).
"I regret my public outburst during a press conference and the revelation of the vote that took place at the selection meeting," said Simmons.
"I extend a public apology to all whom I may have offended. I have personally apologised to my fellow selectors and the WICB and now do so again publicly.
"I am looking forward to putting this behind me and doing the job I enjoy with the West Indies' senior men's teams."
Simmons played 26 Tests as an all-rounder for the West Indies between 1988 and 1997, and became head coach of their senior squads in March.
Eldine Baptiste took over from Simmons for the current tour of Sri Lanka, with the West Indies losing both Tests and all three one-day internationals before Wednesday's concluding Twenty20 match.
