[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has called for an independent review of safety on a road where a family of five was killed in a crash.

Angela Cockburn, 49, her husband David, 48, his two daughters Carley Ann, 21, and Bethany, 18, and Bethany's one-year-old daughter Lacie were killed on the A18 in Laceby near Grimsby in 2013.
The family, from Ouston, were going to a dance competition.
The Grimsby stretch of the A18 featured in a BBC television programme, Britain's Killer Roads, in 2011.
The family were killed after their car collided with a lorry.
During an inquest at Cleethorpes Town Hall, Coroner Paul Kelly called for North East Lincolnshire Council and their contractors to start an independent review of the A18 between Laceby roundabout and the authority boundary.
The inquest heard evidence that opportunities were missed to fix a defect in the road.
Mr Kelly said: "The gully was well formed, established and a hazard to road users."
Recording a narrative verdict, he added: "In the meantime the road has continued to deteriorate. I do not have confidence in the contractor or authority."
As part of his recommendations he also asked Humberside Police to review within 56 days the way the force report road hazards.
A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said that as a result of the accident the authority and its partner, Cofely, was "rolling out, measures designed to detect and repair defects similar to those involved in this incident".
He said the council would be reviewing the coroner's conclusions and recommendations and "taking appropriate measures."
