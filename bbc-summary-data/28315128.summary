Mr Collins died after being shot in the chest at the Coin Castle Amusements Arcade in Limerick on 9 April, 2009.
Wayne Dundon, 35, of Lenihan Avenue and Nathan Killeen, 23, from Hyde Road, both in Limerick, had pleaded not guilty to his murder.
Both men have been given life sentences.
The court delivered its verdict on Tuesday, two weeks after the two-month trial ended.
The prosecution said that Dundon directed the murder from prison, Killeen was the getaway driver and another man, James Dillon, was the gunman.
Dillon, 28, has already been convicted of the murder.
They said the motive was vengeance for a 10-year prison sentence Dundon blamed on the Collins family, who had given evidence against him in a previous trial.
Roy Collins' family hugged and cried after the verdict was delivered.
His father Steve Collins read a victim impact statement to the court.
Breaking down in tears several times, he said his son was an innocent man and a good, upstanding decent member of society.
Mr Collins said: "On 9 April, cowardly evil men devoid of any standards of mercy or humanity murdered him, shooting him in an act of cold blood. And why? Because we did our civic duty as a family.
"Since these people infected our lives with their hateful poison, every moment of every hour since that awful day we are numb with grief. Our sense of loss is so profound impossible to find words to describe.
"It is a loss we will never get over. There are days when it is difficult to do basic tasks."
Mr Collins said the family had also been handed a life sentence and he said "all this happened because we stood up to these people".
He also spoke about how the family had been forced to leave Ireland and said they would never get over the loss of their son.
He described how he held his dying son in his arms: "He was gasping for breath and he wanted me to know he loved me and his mother.
"When they murdered my son they wounded me and I am slowly bleeding to death. I live with the reality that they came for me."
Speaking about the impact of the killing on his wife, Mr Collins said: "No mother should have to bury her child, particularly one whose life was ended by such a callous event."
He added that the victim's brothers and sisters had their "world torn apart".
"The murder cost them the happiest years of their lives. These thugs forced them into a life of fear, always looking over their shoulder."
Mr Collins also thanked the people of Limerick and the public for their support.
He said he hoped the breaking up of the gang and new laws "would be part of Roy's legacy and his needless death would not be entirely in vain".
Speaking outside the court, Mr Collins said the family's ten-year nightmare was over, justice has been served and maybe now they could get on with their lives.
"It's been a dreadful time", he said.
He also said he would like to think the family could return to Limerick and rebuild their lives there.
