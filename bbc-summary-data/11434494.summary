[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Proposals to make workers clock off when they go for a cigarette break have been backed by a Norfolk council.

Staff at Breckland Council will not be paid in future for the time they take to have a cigarette after the proposals were given the go-ahead.
Simon Clark, from Smokers' lobby group Forest, said earlier that everyone was entitled to a break during work.
The council said the move was aimed at making the issue of smoke breaks fairer for individuals who did not smoke.
William Nunn, leader of the Conservative-run council, said: "We are not trying to stop smoking... what we are saying is when people go for a cigarette they should do it in their own time."
Mr Clark said: "Are they going to introduce clocking in and off for people who go on the internet, on Facebook, or people who want to have a cup of coffee?
"I am sure there are some smokers who abuse the situation and go out too often but if that is happening that is a failure of management."
A meeting of the full council voted to approve the measure on Wednesday.
