[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion have signed defender Greg Halford on a month-long loan deal from Championship rivals Nottingham Forest.

The 29-year-old usually plays at centre-back or right-back but can also operate in midfield or up front.
He is the Seagulls' third loan signing in the past week and manager Sami Hyypia said: "With Aaron Hughes out injured we needed cover.
"Greg has an abundance of experience in the Championship and Premier League."
Hyypia added: "With Aaron out we wanted that level of experience to be replaced as well, so he is a good fit."
Halford has scored eight goals in 82 appearances since joining Forest in summer 2012 but he has not featured so far this season.
Albion defender Hughes, who can play all across the back line, is currently sidelined with an ankle injury while first-choice centre-backs Gordon Greer and Lewis Dunk are each one booking away from a one-match ban.
Halford, who began his career at Colchester and has had permanent spells at Reading, Sunderland, Wolves and Portsmouth, becomes the sixth loan player on Brighton's books - one more than the number permitted in a 18-man matchday squad in the Championship.
