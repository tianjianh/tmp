The fire that swept through Kenya's main international airport in August was caused by an electrical fault, not a terrorist attack, US investigators have confirmed.

Kenya asked the FBI to help with the investigation to allay concerns that the airport may have been attacked.
The fire gutted the arrivals terminal at Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.
It forced the closure of the airport, leaving many passengers stranded.
The fire was brought under control after about four hours.
The airport is a regional hub, serving more than 16,000 passengers daily,
The US ambassador to Kenya, Robert Godec, briefed President Uhuru Kenyatta about the FBI's findings at a meeting in  Nairobi.
"Kenya will work closely with international partners on all security matters for the common good of the country, the region and the world," Mr Kenyatta said.
He and Mr Godec also discussed last month's attack by the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabab group on the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi.
At least 67 people were killed when militants stormed the shopping centre and took control of it for several days.
