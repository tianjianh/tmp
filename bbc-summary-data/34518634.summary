Bids invited for A96 dualling design contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Companies have been invited to submit designs for the latest stretch of dual carriageway planned for the A96.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The design contract, worth between Â£40m and Â£50m, covers about 29 miles of the road's western section, east of Auldearn to east of Fochabers.
Earlier this year a Â£30m contract was awarded to design 19 miles of dual carriageway between Inverness and Nairn.
Ministers said the contract marked "a further milestone" in the project.
The work to upgrade the latest section of A96 forms part of a wider project to build 88 miles of dual carriageway between Inverness and Aberdeen.
The latest design contract is expected to be awarded early next year,
Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown said: "The publication of this contract notice marks another significant milestone in a dualling programme that will deliver a number of benefits when completed, including improved journey time and reliability, improved connectivity and improved road safety for all those who use this key artery connecting two of Scotland's economic hubs.
"With the Scottish government making major infrastructure investment in projects like the A9, new Queensferry Crossing and recently completed Borders Railway, this contract for the A96 further underlines the significant investment we are making in our transport network across Scotland."
