[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Alloa Athletic beat Airdrieonians 4-3 on penalties to reach the Scottish Championship play-off final against Brechin City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jon Robertson's stunning strike levelled the scores on aggregate.
Penalties were almost not required when Alloa's Jordan Kirkpatrick hit the outside of a post with a free-kick in extra time.
But it was left to Calum Waters to score the winning spot-kick following two saves from goalkeeper Neil Parry.
It means that Alloa, who finished runners-up in League One, 10 points ahead of the Diamonds, will face the fourth-placed side in the final with promotion at stake.
