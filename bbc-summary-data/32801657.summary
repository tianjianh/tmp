[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has admitted murdering a woman who had obtained a restraining order against him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Keough, 44, pleaded guilty to murdering Sally Campion, 45, via video link to St Albans Crown Court from Woodhill Prison in Milton Keynes.
Keough, of no fixed address, defied the order banning him from her home in Bishop's Stortford on 2 July 2014.
Police and ambulance crews found her with serious injuries. She died the next day at hospital in Cambridge.
A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death to be head injuries, the court heard.
He had originally denied murder but changed his plea.
Judge Andrew Bright QC adjourned sentence until 5 June and remanded Keough in custody.
The case had been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because of prior police contact with the victim.
