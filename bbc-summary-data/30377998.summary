A contraflow system which led to long delays for motorists in Oxford has been removed.

Traffic works reduced the A423 to one lane between Hinksey Hill and Heyford Hill interchanges during a Â£6m scheme to create a roundabout at Kennington.
At the time in July, motorists were warned to use alternative forms of transport because of lengthy delays.
David Nimmo Smith, head of transport at Oxfordshire County Council, said there would still be some disruption.
BBC Radio Oxford travel presenter Sara Dumbell said journeys had been much improved since the contraflow was removed on Sunday night.
There will be travel restrictions in place ahead of traffic lights being installed next Monday.
Mr Nimmo Smith added there could be more work on ring roads around the city after the new year.
