A 49-year-old man was walking his dog with a friend when another dog attacked his pet in Bruntsfield Links in Edinburgh on Wednesday morning.
In the row that followed, the victim was grappled to the ground and pelted with a plastic dog ball thrower.
He has bruising and swelling to his knuckles but was not seriously hurt.
Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which took place at about 10:45.
The attacker is white, 5ft 10in tall, of medium build, with short grey hair and a grey beard.
He was wearing a dark blue jacket, jeans and trainers and was walking a black Labrador.
Sgt Andy Wilson, of Police Scotland, said: "The Meadows is often very busy and this incident may have attracted the attention of anyone who was within the park at the time.
"I would ask any members of the public who witnessed the assault, or can help us identify the suspect, to contact police immediately."
