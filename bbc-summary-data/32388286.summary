Unusual election pledges: Selfie laws, a cannabis summit and 'universal peace'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Most of us have had as much time as we need to browse the main manifestos of the biggest parties - but there are some more unusual offerings for voters in this election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There are local parties, very left-wing parties, very right-wing parties, parties called things like World Peace Through Song, various permutations of religious parties and of course a great array of single-issue campaigners.
Fancy something completely different from the mainstream offering? If you live in the right constituency, you could be in luck.
You could peruse the manifesto of Children of the Atom, standing in Shrewsbury & Atcham (click on constituency names for full candidate lists), which it describes as a "radical" and "transformative" set of ideas for a brave new world.
It focuses on the creation of debt-free money,  a single 10% annual tax on all electronic bank deposits and issued notes and coins, and a universal payment to every citizen for life equal to the average wage.
"Changing the world for the better cannot be achieved with systems that are built for a bygone age and to enrich the few," says leader Stirling McNeillie. "We need to start again from scratch."
Or what about the Humanity party - slogan "love is always the answer" - standing in Derbyshire Dales. It says its policies are a matter for its participants to determine as they feel appropriate, but it does list a set of principles they should adhere to including:
Or there's The New Society of Worth in Preseli Pembrokeshire, which propose email voting on all local and national issues.
It wants to reduce the pensionable age, opposes fracking and asks on its website: "Have you noticed lately there is now a lack of ambulances? This will be changed by TNSW."
Ubuntu, inspired by the South African party of the same name, formed in the UK last year and is standing in Stoke-on-Trent Central and Sutton Coldfield.
It says its policies are based on the principles of "contributionism" and it wants to move "from a money-driven society to a society driven by people, their talents and their passion for life".
Manifesto pledges include:
"There doesn't have to be money," says Stoke candidate Paul Toussaint. "The system that we've got is favouring the few and making a lot of other people suffer."
Hoi Polloi - sample slogan "the great and the good are not that great and not much good" -  wants to "wrestle democracy back from the political class".
Filmmaker Geoff Moseley, standing in Hornsey & Wood Green, is fed up with all politicians, and doesn't even agree with manifesto pledges.
"They're not worth the paper they're written on," he says.
"If manifestos were contracts, we could take governments to court and hold them liable for not fulfilling their stated objectives. But they're not...
"I want a new political era. Russell Brand has been talking about revolution: I'm trying to start one."
It is his first election and he says he will be "lucky to keep my deposit" but hopes to enlarge his party in the future.
"There's a lot of disillusionment out there."
All a bit much? Rather focus on a single issue?
Cista, or Cannabis is Safer than Alcohol, is fielding 32 candidates. It describes itself as the first pro-drug reform political party to contest a general election across the UK and its manifesto pledges include:
The Land Party - whose sole candidate Derek Jackson is standing against David Cameron and others in Witney - is, perhaps unsurprisingly, campaigning for all people to have land.
Other policies include:
The Above and Beyond party is fielding five candidates around England and Wales, and its manifesto focuses almost solely on getting a mandatory "none of the above" option on all ballot papers for all UK general elections.
If you're worried about overpopulation, the Population Party is standing in Stretford and Urmston. Its manifesto lists policies in areas like sex education, economic strategy, "family subsidies" and international aid.
"Taking moderate action now to slow and reverse population growth would help the United Kingdom to meet many of the policy changes it faces," says candidate Paul Carson.
Or what about the Beer, Baccy and Scratchings party - which had to change its name from Beer, Baccy and Crumpet after the Electoral Commission deemed it sexist - standing in Eastleigh.
Despite its quirky name, it says it has "serious political objectives" and Mr Hall is an "anti-austerity candidate caring for the interests of lower-income families".
Among its aims are:
All a bit serious? Well there are some more classically wacky pledges around.
The Eccentric Party of Great Britain's candidate is former Monster Raving Loony Lord Toby Jug. He's standing against Boris Johnson among others - including his former Loony colleague Howling Laud Hope - in Uxbridge & South Ruislip, and has a list of policies including:
His old mates at the Monster Raving Loony Party have not yet published their 2015 manifesto. But the party has an array of policy proposals on its website. Its 16 candidates are campaigning to:
No Monster Raving Loony Party candidate has yet retained their deposit. But it does say governments tend to adopt so many of its ideas that "we're the government's think tank".
