The 27-year-old joined the Hatters in the summer of 2015 following his release by Bournemouth and has since scored seven goals in 42 appearances.
But just three of those have come in the league this season and the Northern Ireland international has joined a Boro side 15th in the table.
McQuoid has found the net 22 times in 197 career league appearances.
