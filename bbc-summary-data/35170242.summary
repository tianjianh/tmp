[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Search teams have entered the fifth day of looking for a Swansea man who went missing after a night out in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Miers went out on Saturday evening and was reported missing on Sunday afternoon after failing to return home.
The 21-year-old was last seen on a footpath by the River Tawe and he may have planned to walk home to Bonymaen.
Divers have been searching a stretch of the river while coastguards, police and fire crews have also been involved.
Police say a witness followed Mr Miers through the nearby Parc Tawe retail park at about 22:30 GMT because they were concerned about his "intoxicated" state.
They then saw him cross a river bridge and walk down a footpath leading to the river.
The search has also been widened to areas where Mr Miers was known to go, particularly when coming home from a night out.
South Wales Police Ch Insp Chris Truscott appealed for anyone who may have seen the children's football coach to come forward.
