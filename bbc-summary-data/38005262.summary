The Trump resistance movement builds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
President Barack Obama, as the campaigner-in-chief for Hillary Clinton, would often remind upset rally-goers "don't boo. Vote."

But now that the election is over, and the vote is in, Americans wishing to protest their victorious political rivals are looking for other ways to voice their dissatisfaction.
Not surprisingly, many are trying to use their wallet to punish Donald Trump, his business empire, his children's business interests, as well as any businesses that supported the Republican candidate's campaign.
Others have turned to street protests, or targeted campaigns to influence elected officials.

A campaign has been launched using the slogan #GrabYourWallet to persuade women to boycott the Ivanka Trump Collection, a clothing and jewellery line owned by the president-elect's daughter.
The movement was started by a digital brand strategist in San Francisco who was upset that Ms Trump did not condemn a leaked recording of her father boasting that his celebrity status allowed him to "grab" women's genitals.
Separately, residents in several New York City west side apartment buildings bearing Mr Trump's name have voted to remove the moniker from the premises.
The property firm that owns the buildings said it was adopting "a neutral building identity that appeals to all current and future residents".
At least three NBA basketball teams are reportedly considering staying in hotels that do not bear the Trump name.
During the campaign, Hillary Clinton supporters kept track of companies that endorsed Mr Trump, in order to avoid buying their products.
When the owner of DG Yuengling & Son, the oldest American brewery, gave a tour of the bottling plant to Eric Trump and expressed support for his father's campaign, beer-drinking Democrats did a spit take.
Brian Sims, a Democratic congressman from Philadelphia, urged members of the LGBT community to shun the Pennsylvania brewery's product, and many did.
Gay bars around the country emptied their taps the next day.
Activists are urging a boycott of Ultimate Fighting Championship and New Balance shoes because their executives have voiced support for Mr Trump.
There have also been calls to boycott PayPal, because its founder, Peter Thiel, is a Trump donor, even though he is no longer affiliated with the company.
Demonstrations broke out in most major cities in the days immediately after the surprise Trump victory, and have so far been the most visible part of the backlash.
The city of Portland, Oregon, on the West Coast quickly became the epicentre, after police declared the gathering of more than 4,000 people "a riot".
High schools and universities continue to see student-led walkout protests more than a week after the election.
Democratic supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders have been leading protests and sit-ins against members of their party's establishment, bringing in Occupy Wall Street-style tactics, in a move that analysts see as a Democratic "Tea Party" fringe movement.
The idea of wearing a safety pin as a political message emerged in the UK after a surge in reports of hate crime following its vote to leave the European Union.
Wearers have done so to show solidarity with victims of racist, religious or homophobic abuse.
Safety pins have in recent days been adopted in the US as a symbol of solidarity with victims of hate crimes, amid a spate of alleged US attacks following Mr Trump's election victory.
Pantsuit Nation, named after Mrs Clinton's trademark clothing trouser suits, is an invitation-only Facebook group.
After election night, there were around 1.3 million followers. But even with the race over, the page has kept growing to 3.6 million.
Members agreed to share their stories with the BBC.
Some said they face isolation from friends and family, especially in Republican-leaning states.
"A man whom I have dated for years has just told me he isâ€¦ on the verge of ending our relationship," writes one woman.
Some also changed their profile pictures and backgrounds to black on Twitter in protest at Mr Trump's win.
A "Women's March on Washington" has been planned for the January weekend of Mr Trump's inauguration in Washington DC, with over 90,000 people RSVPing to the Facebook page.
The rally takes its name from the 1963 civil rights protest led by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.
Other protests, including one held by the influential African-American Reverend Al Sharpton, are due to be held in the week leading up the formal handover of power.
The Democratic-led Washington DC City Council is trying to curtail the number of viewing stands along the parade route.
Independent council member Elissa Silverman said Mr Trump "has stated positions that are hostile to our residents".
The most classic way to influence Washington has been redefined for the digital age, with one former Capitol Hill staffer posting her viral advice for how to do your own personal lobbying.
Emily Ellsworth, who spent six years working on Capitol Hill for two Utah congressmen, outlined in a Twitter post how members of Congress hear from their constituency, and how members of the public can best grab their representative's attention.
Her advice? Write to your congressional representative, but also ring their office and attend town hall meetings. Facebook and Twitter comments are "largely ineffective" because staffers only look at them to delete offensive postings.
One website has come up with a creative way to solicit donations by asking donors to "get mad and help others get even".
RageDonate pairs a controversial Trump quote with a charity supporting the cause or group that he attacked.
"I think Islam hates us," one quote reads, with a link to donate to the Council on American-Islamic Relations.
Groups whose federal funding is threatened under a Republican presidency, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are soliciting money from the public directly.
Planned Parenthood, a family planning organisation that Republicans hope to "defund", is seeking contributions that some donors have cheekily made in Vice-President-elect Mike Pence's name.
Sanctuary for immigrants
The mayors of so-called "sanctuary cities" are pledging to continue their policies of granting legal protections to undocumented immigrants in case federal authorities under the Trump administration want to deport them.
During his campaign, Mr Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the cities that fail to comply.
Although there is no legal definition of a "sanctuary city" it is usually taken to mean a city that does not co-operate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
San Francisco issues ID cards to undocumented immigrants, allowing them access to local government services.
Some cities ban police from asking about immigration status so as not to deter people from reporting crimes.
