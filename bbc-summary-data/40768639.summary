The England Under-19 international previously had a three-month spell with the Blues during the 2016 season, scoring twice in nine appearances.
"To be back here is great," Kelly, 19, told the club website.
"It gives me a chance to prove myself in WSL 1. Now we are back in the top flight and we have a point to prove."
