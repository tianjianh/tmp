Derby 'first to hold cathedral services in Catholic church'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglicans are to hold a cathedral service in a Roman Catholic Church in what is thought to be a first in the UK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derby Cathedral is to have an Â£800,000 refurbishment and will be closed during the week until the end of August.
It means some services will be held at nearby St Mary's church, starting on Thursday evening.
An Association of English Cathedrals spokeswoman said she believed this had not happened before in the UK.
Derby Cathedral was awarded Â£660,000 in government grants and has raised more than Â£120,000 toward work on the heating, wiring and roof.
Lucille Parsisson, from the cathedral, said: "We are very grateful to St Mary's for helping us out but we have a very good relationship with them.
"It struck us that while Anglican church services had been held in Catholic churches before, we couldn't think of a time when a cathedral service had been.
"The curate did some research and found it was indeed the first time."
Ms Parsisson said they planned to use St Mary's three times a week for Evening Prayers or Evensong and the Anglican Chapel of St Mary on the Bridge in the morning.
A spokeswoman for the Association of English Cathedrals, which represents English Anglican cathedrals, said she could not recall an Anglican cathedral service ever being held in a Catholic church before.
