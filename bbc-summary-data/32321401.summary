[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Primary school-aged children in Wales are more likely to have smoked e-cigarettes than tobacco, a study has found.

Six per cent of pupils aged under 11 said they had used e-cigarettes, compared to 2% who had tried tobacco, the Cardiff University study found.
Six per cent of 10 to 11-year-olds and 12% of 11 to 16-year-olds said they had used an e-cigarette at least once.
Only 15 to 16-year-olds asked said they smoked tobacco more than e-cigarettes.
The research, carried out on behalf of the Welsh government, used data from two national surveys conducted in 2013-14 involving primary and secondary school pupils.
The study found:
The Welsh government's chief medical officer, Dr Ruth Hussey, said she was concerned e-cigarettes could normalise smoking among a generation which had grown up in a largely smoke-free society.
"This research demonstrates that e-cigarettes are being used by young people who have never smoked," she said.
"We should be doing everything we can to prevent a new generation becoming addicted to nicotine, because it is a highly addictive substance and has been shown to impact on brain development."
She added a Welsh government white paper would set out proposals to restrict the use of e-cigarettes in public places in line with restrictions on conventional cigarettes in a bid to protect people's health.
If approved, Wales could be the first part of the UK to ban them in enclosed public places.
