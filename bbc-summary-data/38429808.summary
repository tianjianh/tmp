After Chester's Sam Hughes had headed against the bar, Moors led on 17 minutes when Jamey Osborne fired home through a crowded box after Liam Daly's header had hit the post.
Chester then hit the woodwork again from Evan Horwood's left-foot free kick before home striker James Alabi had a close-range header saved.
But Solihull doubled their lead from big centre-half Daly's thunderous right-foot volley from a free-kick, following Jordan Chapell's challenge on Shepherd Murumbedzi.
Home keeper Alex Lynch denied Harry White from close range before Daly headed against the bar.
But White got the Moors' third from the spot, crashing home right-footed off the underside of the bar after referee Peter Wright had harshly awarded a penalty when Murumbedzi's fierce 25-yard shot struck Chester defender Luke George's arm.
Chester drop to ninth, seven points shy of the play-offs, nine points ahead of 16th-placed Solihull, who had won 3-2 at Damson Park against City's 10 men on Boxing Day.
