It was taken by the River Thames by Lee Acaster from Wortham in Suffolk, capturing the Shard in the background.
Acaster, who won the urban wildlife category and the Â£5000 top prize, called it a "real privilege" to be able to get so close to the wild bird.
"I vividly remember the excitement I felt as she patiently waited for me to get the shot, and I knew immediately this was a once in a lifetime opportunity," he said.
"I'm just grateful that she didn't lose interest as quickly as my children do when I'm taking photographs of them."
Judges awarded prizes in 16 categories. A Life At Sea For Nesting Gannets was taken in the Shetland Isles by Ruth Asher, from Cholsey, Oxfordshire and won the habitat category.
This picture of an otter capturing a puffin was taken in the Shetland Isles by Richard Shucksmith from Shetland. It won the animal behaviour category.
This year's coast and marine category was won by Alexander Mustard from Peterborough, with this shot taken in Cornwall, called Big Blues, Blue Sharks. He also won the British nature in black and white category, with the shot below on the left, called Blue on Black.
