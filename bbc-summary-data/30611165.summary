Dustin Diamond, 37, faces charges of felony second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct, and carrying a concealed weapon.
The fight is said to have happened on Thursday in Port Washington, Wisconsin, while Diamond was with his fiancee.
Crime reports say the pair had been to several bars before they got into a row with two men and another woman.
The fight took place at the Grand Avenue Saloon.
When police caught up with the couple's car near the bar, Diamond told police he had a "pen" in his hand when he grabbed one of the men, according to the criminal complaint.
Officers found a switchblade knife in the car - the point of it appeared to be covered in blood.
Reports say that Diamond later told police he accidentally stabbed the man while he was trying to defend his fiancee - 27-year-old Amanda Schutz.
She also faces a charge of disorderly conduct.
Diamond appeared in Ozaukee County court on Friday and his bail was set at $10,000 (Â£6,425). His next hearing is set for 29 December.
Police said the man who was stabbed was injured in the armpit but is not thought to be seriously hurt.
Representatives for Diamond have not yet commented and the actor is yet to release a formal statement.
Saved by the Bell aired during the 1990s and followed the lives of a group of high school students.
Since the show ended, Diamond has been sued a number of times for failure to pay taxes and in foreclosure proceedings following missed mortgage payments.
He has appeared on reality TV shows, made a sex tape and made a documentary called The Unauthorised Saved by the Bell Story.
