Massive fan Nathan could never watch his team play because of a medical condition called autism.
It's a condition that affects the way you see the world around you. It can make you extremely sensitive to sounds, touch, smells, and light. So somewhere very busy and loud like a football match can be really stressful.
Nathan's family wanted a safe, calm space for their sons and others to watch football. They campaigned for a special room for people with autism and similar conditions.
