[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
GPs in Conwy county have said their surgeries are stretched to the limit due to a shortage of doctors.

Dr Amit Singh told a Colwyn Bay Town Council meeting that the number of GPs at his Penrhyn Bay surgery had fallen from five to two.
Dr Bryn Roberts at Cadwgan Surgery in Old Colwyn said the system was at "breaking point".
Betsi Cadwaladr health board said it provided guidance and support to all GP practices in north Wales.
Dr Roberts's colleague, Dr Dylan Parry, warned that because of pressure and overwork, some GPs were leaving the profession when they were only in their 40s.
Figures released in February showed Betsi Cadwaladr health board had a 14% vacancy rate for doctors, joint second highest among Wales' seven health boards.
A health board spokesman said it had offered to attend the council meeting, but the town council had preferred to hear directly from doctors.
He added: "Where specific concerns are raised, these are considered with the practices and actions agreed.
"This has included providing support through additional services that will help to alleviate pressures being experienced and support with improvement to premises."
