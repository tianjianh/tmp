[SN]TITLE[SN]
Christopher Hopkins: Policeman accused of sexual assaults

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police constable was "unable to contain his urges" as he committed a string of sexual assaults while on duty, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Hopkins, 41, is said to have targeted three alleged victims between 2006 and 2013.
They included an under-age girl, a 17-year-old girl and a Merseyside Police colleague, Preston Crown Court heard.
Mr Hopkins, of Whickham Close, Widnes, Cheshire, denies five counts of sexual assault.
The married father also denies one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and one count of misconduct in a public office.
Opening the prosecution, Richard Haworth told jurors: "The Crown's case, in a nutshell, is that he was unable to contain his sexual urges and all of these alleged offences were committed to satisfy his predatory sexual nature."
The first complainant was aged between 13 and 15 when Mr Hopkins visited her home address after she had been reported missing.
While alone together in the kitchen, the court heard, he commented that she looked old for her age and effectively "gave her the once over" as he looked her up and down.
Mr Haworth said the complainant felt "intimidated" when Mr Hopkins asked her for a kiss.
She went to give him a kiss on the cheek but the defendant turned and kissed her on the lips, the jury was told.
The next alleged victim was a work colleague, the court heard.
Mr Hopkins is said to have approached her desk at the police station and twice suggested they could have a sexual liaison - offers she rejected, the court heard.
The third complainant, who was 17 at the time, was given a lift home by Mr Hopkins in his marked patrol car as she walked from a friend's house.
Mr Haworth said he drove her to a secluded location and parked before engaging in "sexually explicit" conversation.
The defendant also allegedly arranged over the internet to meet a man for sexual activity when he should have been on duty.
The trial continues.
