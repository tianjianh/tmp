[SN]TITLE[SN]
Secretary 'kissed not bitten' by surgeon, Bristol court told

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knee surgeon accused of biting his secretary on the arm claimed it was "an affectionate kiss," a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Johnson, 57, denies assaulting Krysha James, his secretary of five years, while the pair were sitting in their office together.
Bristol Magistrates' Court heard Ms James was left with a bruise on her upper left arm after being bitten by the private orthopaedic surgeon.
Mr Johnson, of Sea Walls Road, Bristol, was suspended following the allegation.
The court heard the incident happened at the private Spire Hospital in Bristol on the morning of 3 September.
Ms James said they were going over an invoice and when she went to grab some paper for the printer Mr Johnson "leant forward and bit me".
"I swore at him 'you bloody bitch, you bit me, you don't ever bite me - my kids don't bite and my dogs don't bite'," she said.
"He said 'oh sorry, did that hurt?' I don't know why he did it. There was no horseplay previous to that. We hadn't had an argument so there was no aggression. It just came out of the blue."
Prosecuting, Ian Jackson told the court Mr Johnson disputes any bite on his part.
"He does accept, not just in interview but in a letter which he delivered to her property, there was some contact," he said.
"This was a peck or an affectionate kiss. The Crown say that cannot in certain terms be squared with the injury as shown in photographs."
The trial continues.
