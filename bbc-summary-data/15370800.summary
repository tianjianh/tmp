[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham Police has said a new Â£14m headquarters would save the force money in the long-run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The force wants to knock down its current 42-year-old building in Aykley Heads, which it said was too expensive to run and not "fit for purpose".
New homes are planned for the current site and the new three-storey HQ would be next door.
The force is applying for planning permission and if granted wants the new building to be open by 2014.
The force is holding roadshows throughout the county over the next few weeks to explain the plans.
Peter Thompson, the chairman of Durham Police Authority, said: "The present headquarters dates back to 1969.
"It is no longer considered fit for purpose, with extremely high running and maintenance costs, coupled with the fact it does not lend itself to modern working conditions.
"The new building will represent a considerable saving to the police authority, at a time when every penny spent is being scrutinised and must be justified."
