The 21-year-old former QPR youngster, who joins a side 18th in the table, has made 11 appearances for the Dons since signing for them in September 2014.
But just two of those have come this term - both in the EFL Trophy.
"He will give us width and pace that we have been looking for, along with great delivery and an eye for goal," said Gulls player-manager Kevin Nicholson.
