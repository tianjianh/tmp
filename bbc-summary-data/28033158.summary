No Jimmy Savile abuse at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, report finds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There is no documented evidence to back-up allegations that Jimmy Savile inappropriately touched a patient at Cardiff Royal Infirmary in the 1960s, a report has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The local health board said none of the hundreds of documents it had examined supported the patient's allegation.
It said the patient did not want to be involved in further investigations so no other action could be taken.
It was part of a major inquiry into the late entertainer's abuse.
Cardiff and Vale University Health Board (CVUHB) carried out an investigation after the UK government's Department of Health received claims that Savile abused a patient at Cardiff Royal Infirmary.
It was part of a wider inquiry, which found the ex-BBC DJ sexually assaulted victims aged five to 75 in NHS hospitals over decades of unrestricted access.
A report on the findings of the Cardiff inquiry said the woman claimed she was on a ward at the hospital in either 1964 or 1965 when she was approached by a man she believed to be Savile.
He was dressed in a tracksuit and had long blonde hair and began kissing her arm whilst leaning on the bed.
When he got near her shoulder she said she felt uncomfortable and pulled the sheet, before the man moved away to the next patient.
The woman reported the incident to the police in 2012.
A detailed review of archived material was examined as well as newspapers, photographs and internet searches.
The report found staff who worked at the hospital at the time could not remember Savile visiting in the 1960s and and there was no documentation confirming he had.
The only record of him attending Cardiff Royal Infirmary was a photograph taken in the 1980s when he stopped to use a toilet before posing for a picture with staff.
Director of nursing, Ruth Walker, said the health board had conducted an "exhaustive investigation" into the case.
"Those efforts have found no documented evidence to support the patient's account or place Jimmy Savile at the hospital during the time in question," she said.
"Whilst we have no reason to disbelieve the patient, the health board has examined every possible avenue of enquiry and, given the patient's request not to be involved in any further investigations, there is no additional action that can be taken."
She said the health board had reviewed historical and current policies for safeguarding patients as part of the inquiry and wanted to reassure the public there were robust systems in place to protect patients, staff and visitors.
