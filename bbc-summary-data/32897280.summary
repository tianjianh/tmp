A pilot of The Bastard Executioner was filmed at Pinewood studios near Cardiff but the full production is set to be shot at Dragon studios near Pencoed.
This is because the remake of cult film The Crow starts at Pinewood in July.
The series stars Lee Jones as a 14th Century knight turned executioner during the reign of Edward III.
It is set against a background of Welsh rebellion.
The cast will include a guest appearance by Matthew Rhys.
Series creator Kurt Sutter - also behind the series Sons of Anarchy - said: "I love history. I love theology. I love blood. It's been very satisfying weaving fact and fiction to create a new mythology that combines all these elements."
Dragon at Llanilid in Rhondda Cynon Taff, which was once nicknamed Valleywood, was behind the 2011 medieval adventure film Ironclad.
