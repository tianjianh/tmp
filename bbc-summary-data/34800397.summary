The two sides meet in their opening fixture in Pool 5 at the Stade Felix Mayol, with Toulon currently lying fourth in the French top-flight.
"It is a brilliant opportunity for us to to go out there and show what we can do," Ford, 22, told BBC Points West.
"We're all confident, firing, ready to go and can't wait to get out there."
Bath, who are fifth in the Premiership after two wins from their first four games of the season, lost at Leinster in last season's Champions Cup quarter-finals.
South Africa flanker Francois Louw, who returns for Bath following the World Cup, added: "We had a decent Champions Cup last year, unfortunately not getting past the quarters.
"We want to be a champion side. we want to make finals. We want to win finals. A win against Toulon will really set down a marker for us. It would be a huge win."
Ford continued: "(Toulon) have got world-class international players from one to 23.
"You can't switch off for one second against them - it's got to be an 80-minute performance.
"We want to go out there and attack and play the way we know we can but we've got to put out our best defensive performance as well."
