It wasn't the prettiest of performances from Roy Hodgson's men but the defence did well and England have avoided Spain in the last eight.
Here are my England player ratings for the match against Ukraine.

Guy's view:  Commanding presence as always from the Manchester City keeper. He was constantly organising and cajoling his back four into shape. He made one fine save to deny Yevhen Konoplyanka that was far better than it looked because the ball was really wobbling about.
Guy's view: I have been so impressed by the defensive side to his game at this tournament and once again he showed great awareness by chasing from the right into the middle to cover when needed.
Guy's view: His positioning is as good as any centre-back in the game. There was just one moment of worry when Marko Devic twisted and turned and got into a good shooting position. The ball was over the line, but if Terry had not got back when he did then it would have been a goal.
Guy's view: Steady and solid as he has been in all three group games. I actually think this was his best performance in Ukraine so far. He also got back to make a crucial tackle on Andriy Yarmolenko.
Guy's view: Another good, strong display and the Chelsea defender got forward a bit more in this game than he was able to in the previous two games. He did everything right defensively - but you wouldn't expect anything different from him. Almost scored his first international goal.
Guy's view: The statistics at half-time showed what they always do - that Milner covered more ground than any other England player. Most of it was in a straight line up and the down the right-hand side. He did not create much from an attacking sense, but you can see exactly why Roy Hodgson picks him.
Guy's view: Another towering performance from the England captain, who was named Uefa's man-of-the-match. It might have passed through a few bodies, but he claimed another assist at this tournament. Has to be seen as England's key player.
Guy's view: As usual, he did the dirty unsung-hero stuff in the middle superbly. He missed quite a few games in the season for Tottenham and looked to be struggling in the warmth towards the end of games, but you know he'll keep on going until he drops.
Guy's view: Had an awful start and was out of position when he was meant to be getting back to help the defence. He looked nervous and short on confidence but grew into the game and got better. By the end of the match, he had given a decent performance.
Guy's view: The young Manchester United striker did well again and he just needs to make himself more of an attacking threat to be an all-round top striker at international level. He really holds the ball up well and has a great understanding with club team-mate Wayne Rooney.
Guy's view: Clearly short of match sharpness. Looked as though he had missed his big opportunity with the header he sent wide when he'd normally score that with his eyes closed. Rooney ended up being the match winner and every team needs a man like that.
THEO WALCOTT (RIGHT MIDFIELD) 70 MINS (for JAMES MILNER) - 6
Guy's view: Walcott came on for the final 20 minutes and didn't do anything wrong. Equally, he didn't do anything spectacular and didn't touch the ball that often.
Andy Carroll (forward) 82 mins for Danny Welbeck and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (forward) 87 mins for Wayne Rooney were not on long enough to merit a rating.
You can hear Guy's commentary on the Euro 2012 quarter-final tie against Italy in Kiev on BBC1, BBC HD and streamed live on the BBC Sport website on Sunday.
