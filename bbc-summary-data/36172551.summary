Tom Graveney: Memorial service held for former England cricketer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cricketing legends and celebrities remembered the life of former England batsman Tom Graveney at Worcester Cathedral.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graveney, who played 79 Tests for England before becoming a pundit and commentator, died aged 88 in November.
He also played for Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Queensland, and is one of only 25 players to score more than 100 centuries.
Guests included Lord Mervyn King, Sir Michael Parkinson and David Gower.
Former Bank of England governor Lord King, who is president of Worcestershire County Cricket Club, said his friend would always be remembered for the "extraordinary elegance" of his batting.
"You could have watched Tom play a forward defensive stroke all day," he said.
"He was a very humble, modest person, and a very genuine and warm friend."
Fellow former England captain Gower said Graveney's qualities were still important to modern cricket fans.
"People like us look for stylists in the modern game, and there is inspiration there in the man who was Tom Graveney," he said.
