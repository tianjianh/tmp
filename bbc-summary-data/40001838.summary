The Scot, 25, beat Nicolas Peifer of France 7-6 (3) 6-1 in Sunday's final.
Reigning Wimbledon champion Reid secured his second Super Series title and will top the rankings for the third time when they are published this week.
"I'm very happy to be coming home with the title and regaining my place at the top of the singles rankings," he said.
"My performances in Japan have given me a good confidence boost looking ahead to the summer Grand Slams."
Reid first gained number one spot after winning gold at the Rio 2016 Paralympics against fellow Briton Alfie Hewett.
He remained top for three weeks before regaining the position in December after reaching the final of the wheelchair Masters in London.
