More than 20 of some of the finest vessels in the world have been on show in Blyth since Friday, attracting tens of thousands of visitors.
Nineteen of the ships took part in a parade of sail as part of the North Sea Tall Ships Regatta.
The event will end with a race from the Northumberland coast to Gothenburg, Sweden.
Northumberland County Council, which jointly organised the regatta, hailed it as a success and said it hoped it would open the door to similar events.
The event attracted ships from as far afield as Portugal and Russia to take part in the 500-nautical mile race across the North Sea to Sweden.
Councillor Grant Davey, leader of the county council, said he hoped it would put Blyth on the map for future events.
He said: "We'll move on to bigger and better things in the future."
