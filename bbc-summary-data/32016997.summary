Detailed plans to redevelop parts of Gloucester Cathedral have been unveiled, as part of a Â£6m project.

The proposals include building a new glass entrance, replacing the car park with a public space and installing solar panels on the Nave roof.
It is part of a 10-year plan, known as Project Pilgrim, to improve facilities at the medieval building.
Staff are asking for feedback to the plans, which will be on display in the cathedral until 20 April.
Dean of Gloucester, The Very Reverend Stephen Lake, said: "Gloucester Cathedral is a place for everyone so it is important that the people of the city and county have an opportunity to let us know what they think of the changes we are proposing to make to their Cathedral.
"We invite everyone to help to shape the project by taking part in this important consultation."
