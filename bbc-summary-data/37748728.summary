A man has been charged with murder following the discovery of a dismembered and burnt man in a suitcase in a lay-by near the Peak District.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The remains, missing the head and arms, were discovered just off the A628 at Tintwistle, Derbyshire, on 10 October.
Ming Jiang, 42, from Manchester, will appear before magistrates in Chesterfield later.
The name of the victim will not be released until his family has been informed of his death, the force said.
The man is believed to be about 18 to 40 years old, with white or light-coloured skin and 5ft 8ins to 5ft 11ins (1.73m to 1.80m) tall.
Police believe the remains were dumped sometime between 21:00 BST and midnight on Sunday, 9 October.
Inquiries were widened to include missing people cases from areas including Manchester, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Cheshire, Merseyside and Staffordshire, in a bid to find the man's identity.
Detectives denied speculation the body was that of Corrie McKeague, 23, who vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds in September.
