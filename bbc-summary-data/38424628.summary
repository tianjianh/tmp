[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Boyce scored twice as Ross County beat Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3-2 to leave their Highland rivals bottom of the Scottish Premiership and without a win in 10 matches.

Boyce netted a derby hat-trick earlier this season - and bagged first-half double either side of Carl Tremarco's diving header.
Martin Woods put County 3-1 up on the hour mark, before Alex Fisher's close-range finish set-up a frenetic finale.
Ross County end 2016 in sixth place.
It's been quite a year for County with a League Cup trophy and top-six finish achieved. This was an important win in their quest to finish there again this season.
They're now seven points clear of their Highland rivals and stretched that pack of sevens teams who've been so tightly bunched for so long.
County started brightly and were rewarded immediately. It was another well-worked corner, something they do well, that exposed Inverness' back-line with Andrew Davies flicking to Kenny van der Weg.
He was composed and floated it back into the danger area where Boyce guided the ball in off the bar, before adding his second with a cross-cum-shot.
The clincher was something County have lacked at times since Jackson Irvine's departure to Burton Albion but Woods got beyond the Inverness defence and finished well.
County boss Jim McIntyre deployed Boyce in a deeper, wider role than normal but it didn't diminish his influence. He's not just about goals and while his instinct is to deliver that, he was effective in other ways.
His second goal was perhaps fortunate as it appeared to be a searching cross which took a slight nick off Josh Meekings into the corner.
Boyce should have had a third when Alex Schalk sent over a tantalising ball which the striker tried to take first time but shanked wide.
His value to County is unquestionable and if he stays fit and on this type of form, County will comfortably challenge to finish in the top half of the table.
Inverness have a great record crossing the Kessock Bridge to Dingwall with five wins from their last five prior to this clash.
When you're bottom of the table the last thing you need is conceding a goal almost immediately.
It was terribly soft with the defence slow to react twice before Boyce pounced.
The reaction was impressive as Richie Foran's side went on the front foot and pinned Ross County back.
They were rewarded by another well executed set-piece with Gary Warren bulldozing his way to the ball allowing Tremarco to net with a diving header.
Just when you thought County were cruising, Fisher pounced on Scott Fox's parry to offer a glimmer of hope. It didn't materialise with Billy King closest to a leveller.
Manager Richie Foran will look to add to his squad in the coming weeks. They have time to recover but will need a positive start when the season resumes.
