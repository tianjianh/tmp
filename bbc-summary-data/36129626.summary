Bill Tupou: Wakefield Trinity Wildcats centre signs contract extension

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield Wildcats centre Bill Tupou has signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the Super League club until 2018.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tupou, 25, has made 11 Super League appearances for Wakefield since joining from NRL side Canberra in June 2015.
The Tonga international has played in only three games this season, having missed games with an ankle injury.
Meanwhile, the club has revealed utility back Reece Lyne will miss six to eight weeks with a torn hamstring.
Lyne will have a scan to determine the extent of the injury, which he suffered in Sunday's 46-28 defeat by Hull FC.
Wakefield are ninth in the Super League table after 12 games this season, level on points with eighth-placed Salford.
