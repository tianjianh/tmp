The latest stage of the £1bn transformation of Dundee's waterfront is getting under way.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Contracts worth more than £400,000 have been approved for works at Slessor Gardens and at the rear of the Caird Hall, as well as the replacement of dock gates at Camperdown Dock.
Dundee Waterfront is a regeneration project which is transforming 240 acres of land along the River Tay.
Redevelopment is now well past the halfway mark.
The work at Slessor Gardens, costing £250,000, will include the creation of the Discovery Walk of Fame, the commemorative Royal Arch of trees and the outline formation of the Waterfront Showcase Gardens.
Contractor Sir Robert McAlpine was awarded the contract, which is due to be completed in January next year.
Meanwhile, specialist consultant Mott MacDonald won a contract worth £150,000 to replace the existing dock gates to Camperdown Docks, as part of the City Quay Marina development.
Will Dawson, convener of Dundee City Council's city development committee, said: "With a project as large, complex and lengthy as the redevelopment of the waterfront each element that is started or finished becomes something of a milestone."
The overall project includes the construction of a new railway station, V&A Museum of Design Dundee, a new marina, port developments, offices, hotels, bars, shops, cafes and residential accommodation.
