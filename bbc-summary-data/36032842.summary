Little Stoke Parkrun petition backed by thousands

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 30,000 people have signed a petition against council plans to charge for a Parkrun event in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stoke Gifford Parish Council voted to become the first in the world to charge Parkrun a fee for use of its grounds.
Hundreds take part in two free, timed runs organised by Parkrun UK in Little Stoke Park on Saturdays.
Organisers said it meant the end of the Little Stoke event, while the council said it had received hundreds of abusive emails against the move.

At Tuesday's meeting, councillors claimed it was "unfair" to expect non-running residents to pay for the upkeep of paths, and voted six to four in favour of charges for "wear and tear".
The local Labour group called it a "mean-spirited decision" by Stoke Gifford Parish Council and described the levy as a "health tax".
The decision has been met with strong criticism online, with double Olympic champion Dame Kelly Holmes tweeting: "Have I missed the whole reason park runs exist and are free? Parish council decision is a disgrace."
While marathon runner Paula Radcliffe tweeted she was "totally against this decision" and sports minister Tracey Crouch described the decision as "contrary to government sports strategy" and creating a "barrier to participation".
