Andrew Cunningham fraud: The street conned out of £50,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rogue trader Andrew Cunningham has been jailed for three years for multiple fraud offences. He left behind a trail of residents angry at being conned - and one who still feels guilty for introducing him to her neighbours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
When Irene Bottomley thinks back to the first time she met Andrew Cunningham in the grounds of her local church, she recalls a "personable and friendly person".
Little did she know that in a few months he would have conned her and six other people in Roxholme Terrace in north Leeds out of a collective £50,000.
When Mrs Bottomley met Cunningham she assumed he was supervising a group of probation workers carrying out gardening work.
In fact, Cunningham was doing community service of his own.
He was prosecuted for various offences in 2010 by Trading Standards and ordered to carry out 400 hours of unpaid work.
But when Mrs Bottomley, who is 70, mentioned she needed a new fence, he could not resist the opportunity.
"I said something about needing my garden done, but that I needed a fence put up first and he said 'oh, I'm a fencer'," she told BBC Look North.
"So I assumed he was a bona fide fencer, builder or whatever. So I gave him my name and address.
"I had shown him a fence down the street where someone had a nice high fence, with posts and then very strong wire netting and I'd told him I wanted to be able to grow clematis and honeysuckle up this fence."
But the fence Cunningham built was not fit for purpose. It did not have enough posts and anything growing up it would have brought the fence down, Mrs Bottomley added.
Nevertheless, before she knew it he was building another fence and then began work on her roof. Eventually the cost had escalated to more than £15,000.
"I had put off having the roof done for a long time and I just thought 'well, if he's here and if he can do a reasonable job...'
"And it looked quite good - but he shouldn't have been doing any job. Things like the ridge tiles are going to have to be re-set because the mortar's already breaking up and some of it has come down."
'I feel guilty'
An expert report revealed that she had been overcharged by more than £11,500 for the work, with some work not having been carried out.

Cunningham then canvassed for work on the street and ended up carrying out works at a number of other properties.
"I feel guilty, because I brought him into the street. He wouldn't have been here if it hadn't been for me.
"Other people in the street assumed that because I was employing him that I must have done my homework, that he had been recommended by somebody.
"So they had new roofs put on, other work done and it's all been very, very shoddy. Most people have had to spend money getting things fixed where it's not been up to standard.
"I just feel very annoyed because I feel I've let people down.
"He had the cheek not just to do a couple of houses and then just disappear but he put flyers in the local shop. He was so blatant with it."
Trading Standards found that none of the customers had been given cancellation rights, some had been vastly overcharged, some work had not been carried out and some work was not fit for purpose.
In a bid to cover his tracks, Cunningham used a false name and signature on invoices and 10-year guarantees.
In total the money paid by the eight witnesses amounted to more than £50,000, with £20,000 being overcharged by Cunningham and remedial works of £10,000 needed to fix the damage.
"I can't believe it really," added Mrs Bottomley. "I watch these programmes on the television and I can't believe I fell for it - but he was just such a personable person.
"I made them cups of tea, there were usually about six of them working here. We had long chats and I can't believe that all the time he was taking advantage.
"I just thought it was an opportunity to make the house look better and it looks worse in actual fact."
David Berrill lives down the street. He had seen Cunningham doing work on other homes before being approached about his damaged guttering.
"He was doing everybody else's house on the street and he asked me if I'd like our gutters replacing. I thought that was a really good idea.
"But it turns out he's done a bit of a shoddy job because it leaks where the house meets the neighbours' and the gable end - and two places at the back.
"It'll all have to be fixed because it will ruin the house. I feel stupid. It seemed like a really good idea at the time.
"It was quite expensive, I think I spent nearly £400 and the work is going to have to be redone."
Trading Standards has now made the street a Cold Calling Control Zone to prevent the residents from being targeted in future.
For Mrs Bottomley and Mr Berrill, that has come too late.
