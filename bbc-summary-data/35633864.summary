The man in his 40s was treated for minor injuries after being taken by ambulance to the Royal Surrey County Hospital after Saturday's accident.
A woman in her 30s died at the scene in Bridge Street, Guildford. Police said she had yet to be formally identified but her next of kin had been informed.
Another pedestrian, a man in his 40s, remains in hospital in south London.
The man, who suffered serious pelvic injuries, was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting.
A third pedestrian, a woman in her 30s, who had minor injuries has also been discharged from hospital.
Witnesses who were in the area at the time described a major emergency response with several police cars blocking the road and the Land Rover Defender involved covered from view.
A green screen was erected around the crash site.
Surrey Police is continuing to appeal for witnesses to the accident to come forward.
The crash came just months after another crash near the main entrance to the Friary Centre when a car hit pedestrians and left several people injured, including a toddler and his baby sister.
The collision happened in North Street last October.
Leader of Guildford Borough Council, Paul Spooner, said Saturday's accident was "tragic and saddening".
"We await the outcome of Surrey Police's investigation and until the full reasons are known it is impossible to comment on what the cause could be," he said.
"Although we don't know if the road layout contributed, the Town Centre Masterplan includes options for improving transport and pedestrian movements around the station area and Bridge Street."
