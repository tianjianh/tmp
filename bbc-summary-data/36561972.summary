Ross County are not interested in cashing in on Jackson Irvine, despite interest growing in the midfielder who is establishing himself with Australia.

County rejected an offer for the 23-year-old from English Championship newcomers Burton Albion last week.
"We're not looking to sell Jackson," County manager Jim McIntyre told BBC Scotland.
"He's one of our best players. He's getting game time under his belt and is developing."
Irvine, who joined County permanently from Celtic last summer after a season on loan, helped the Dingwall club finish sixth in the Scottish Premiership and beat Hibernian in the League Cup final.
It was their first national trophy and there was more joy in recent weeks for the midfielder as he won his 10th cap as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Greece.
"When he plays the way he has, like in the League Cup final, people sit up and take note," said McIntyre of the Brewers' failed bid.
McIntyre has signed three defenders - Christopher Routis, formerly of Bradford City, Kenny van der Weg, previously of Breda, and Erik Cikos, who was with Slovan Bratislava - and former Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Aaron McCarey already this summer.
However, he confirmed that he is still looking to make one or two changes to his squad in preparation for the new season.
