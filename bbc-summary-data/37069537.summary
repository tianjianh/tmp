Julie Titheridge killed Stephen Burton almost two years ago, on 20 June 2014, at the house they shared in Selkirk Street, Chaddesden, Derby.
She was originally charged with murdering her 50-year-old boyfriend but a jury at Nottingham Crown Court cleared her of this.
Titheridge, 40, was convicted of manslaughter in June.
