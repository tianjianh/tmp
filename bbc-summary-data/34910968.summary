The attackers, who targeted the Swiss Inn hotel in provincial capital el-Arish, were all killed, they said.
Guards fired on an explosives-laden car, which blew up. But two attackers entered the hotel, killing a judge.
So-called Islamic State's local affiliate, Sinai Province, said it carried out the attack.
Twelve people were also wounded in the incident, a military statement said.
The three-pronged assault saw a car laden with explosives approach the entrance. Security guards opened fire and the vehicle blew up.
Separately two attackers entered the building, One detonated a suicide vest in the kitchen while the other opened fire in a room, killing the judge.
Judges who had been overseeing the second round of parliamentary elections in the area were among the guests in the heavily guarded hotel.
A military statement read: "This brutal incident is a failed attempt to hinder the state from building its institution but we assure all that it will increase the drive and insistence of the armed forces and the Interior Ministry to weed out the roots of terrorism in North Sinai."
Last month a Russian A321 airliner crashed in Sinai killing all 224 people on board. Russia said traces of explosives were found and called it an act of terror.
Sinai Province said in a statement on 31 October that it had destroyed the plane because of Russian air strikes in Syria.
Militants have been fighting the government for years in Sinai but the insurgency has increased since the removal of President Mohammed Morsi in 2013.
