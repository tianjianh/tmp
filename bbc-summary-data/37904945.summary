The home side had to come from behind against a determined Morecambe team who, despite their off-field problems, began the game with a spring in their step.
The Shrimps went ahead in the 10th minute when captain Dean Winnard turned home a Michael Rose free-kick from six yards.
But the goal sparked Coventry in to life, with Sordell, Gael Bigirimana and Jodi Jones peppering Morecambe's goal.
They deservedly got themselves back on level terms after 39 minutes when Kyel Reid broke with the ball from his own 18-yard box to tee up Sordell 20 yards from goal, and he found the bottom left-hand corner.
The Sky Blues began to pile the pressure on Morecambe's defence in the second half, and the comeback was complete in the 58th minute when Sordell struck again with a low 20-yard effort into the bottom left-hand corner.
