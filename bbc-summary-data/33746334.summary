Police in fresh appeal over sexual assault in Dalkeith

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have said they are pursuing new lines of inquiry over a serious sexual assault which took place in Midlothian in late June.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 27-year-old woman was attacked in Dalkeith after being approached by a man at about 03:45 on Sunday 28 June.
She had left a bus on Lauder Road and was forced into a wooded area between Lauder Road and Wester Kippielaw Drive.
Police have launched a fresh appeal for information following a "tremendous response" from the local community.
The appeal comes after officers reviewed CCTV footage and undertook door-to-door inquiries in order to trace the suspect.
He is described as white, aged about 20, approximately 5ft 7in tall, and of a very slim build.
The suspect had short dark hair and was wearing tight-fitted jeans and a shiny black hooded top.
Det Insp Scott Anderson, said: "A month on from this assault I'd like people to think back to the evening of the 27th into the morning of the 28th June and what they were doing.
"Anyone who was in the area might have information that could assist the inquiry and I would encourage you to make contact and speak with the inquiry team.
"What can often seem like a minor piece of detail can often prove to be absolutely crucial so again, anyone who recognises the description or was in the area of Lauder Road on this particular evening is asked to get in touch.
"So far, the response we have received from the local community has been tremendous and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has made contact with us and has assisted with our inquiries so far."
