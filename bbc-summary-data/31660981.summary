She'll take over as the mid-morning presenter and in the Live Lounge, after Fearne revealed she's quitting the station.
Clara currently hosts the Official Chart Show on a Sunday, as well as Radio 1Xtra Weekend Breakfast.
"I am honoured and thrilled to be presenting such a huge show on Radio 1," says Clara, who will start her new job on 25 May.
"The broadcasters who have gone before me have left an impressive trail and I hope to carry that on."
"Doing this job is an absolute joy and to now have the opportunity to broadcast Monday to Friday is something that I am so grateful for.
"I can't wait to introduce a Live Lounge artist for the first time!"
Clara will continue presenting the Official Chart Show, but will step down from her 1Xtra show.
That will be fronted by Ace, who says he is "so excited" to take over the slot.
Ben Cooper, controller of BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra, told Newsbeat: "All of us at Radio 1 are delighted for [Fearne and Jesse] and wish them all the best for the future. It's fantastic news.
"Clara is going to be brilliant on that show.
"Her warmth, her enthusiasm, her friendliness on air. She's really slick as presenter."
Fearne, 33, announced she was leaving after an "incredible decade broadcasting on Radio 1" and confirmed that she was expecting a second child.
Clara Amfo joined 1Xtra in September 2013 and recently made a series of artist-focused documentaries for 1Xtra Live.
