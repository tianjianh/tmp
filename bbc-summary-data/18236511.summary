Wiveliscombe turbines plan sparks opposition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build two wind turbines in the Somerset countryside have prompted a campaign from unhappy local residents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energy Descent wants to put up two turbines at Cordings Farm near Wiveliscombe.
Protester Paul Aslett said: "If one goes up... it could open the floodgates and our countryside could be ruined."
The consultation period is in its final day and the application is due to be considered in mid-June by Taunton Deane Borough Council's planning committee.
Residents unhappy at the proposals have attended local parish council meetings which have been consulted as part of the planning process.
The turbines would have an overall height of 34.2m (112ft) to the tip of the blades.
Mr Aslett has also won the support of Bridgwater MP, Iain Liddell Grainger.
The Conservative MP has written to Taunton Deane Borough Council expressing his objections to the plans.
But Tristan Tonks, Energy Descent's client manager, said: "We would encourage people to understand the whole picture rather than take a view imposed upon them by lobbyists."
In April, Sedgemoor District Council turned down two applications plans to build wind turbines in East and West Huntspill.
