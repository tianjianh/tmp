The American Kennel Club say the breed is so popular because it's got a good temperament, gets along great with families and is super smart.
Other dogs voted amongst America's favourites are German Shepherd, Golden Retriever, Bulldog and Beagle.
In the past 100 years, only four breeds have held the top spot for most popular dog. They are the Labrador, Poodle, Beagle and Cocker Spaniel.
