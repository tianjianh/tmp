Council officials have met with Home Secretary Theresa May to discuss how to accommodate refugees coming to the UK.

Around 20,000 Syrians are expected to be resettled in the UK over the next five years.
They discussed concerns about housing, education and healthcare and how extra services would be funded.
The Local Government Association has called for more resources to help its members house people rather than use their own limited housing stock.
BBC correspondent Daniel Sandford said the UK will look to take in about 400 refugees a month, chosen by the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR. He said the plan was to start taking people in from October.
He said: "Many local authorities are not keen to use their own council housing stock so people are trying to identify landlords who might be able to put up Syrian refugees, paid for by the state."
Prime Minister David Cameron has said people would come from camps bordering Syria, rather than among those already in Europe.
Unlike other asylum seekers they will be able to start work immediately and will be eligible to claim benefits.
David Simmons from the Local Government Association said councils wanted reassurance that long-term plans were in place to help people.
"This is not just about money in the short-term but that resources are going to be there so that families and children are properly supported," he said.
"They need to be able to integrate into life in the UK and think about their education, their work opportunities and their housing opportunities."
Meanwhile, Central European ministers have again rejected a mandatory quota system for sharing out migrant arrivals.
In recent weeks, tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to make their way to Europe from war-torn Syria and Libya. Many have travelled through Hungary to Germany, Austria and Sweden - wealthier EU nations with more liberal asylum laws.
European Council President Donald Tusk has said he will call an emergency summit later this month if a solution to the crisis is not found soon.
