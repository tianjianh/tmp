[SN]TITLE[SN]
Birmingham City 1-3 Brentford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham's poor form under new boss Gianfranco Zola continued as Brentford came from a goal down to beat them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lukas Jutkiewicz took advantage of poor defending to poke the Blues in front.
The Bees came to life after the break as Scott Hogan fired home from inside the box before then missing a penalty after being brought down in the box.
David Davis then deflected a Ryan Woods free-kick past his own keeper and substitute Nico Yennaris fired in a third for the hosts from 25 yards.
Since taking charge of the West Midlands club, Zola has claimed just one point from his four matches in charge.
Blues should have taken the lead early on when David Cotterill fired over when through on goal and Che Adams then shot wide from 10 yards for the hosts.
They finally went in front as a stumble by Bees defender Harlee Dean allowed Jutkiewicz the chance to fire the ball in off keeper Daniel Bentley.
Brentford levelled when Hogan fired in from Romaine Sawyer's deep cross and he should have made it 2-1 when given the chance to score from the spot.
But poor defending by Birmingham allowed Woods' free-kick to hit Davis and Andreas Bjelland on its way in and the Bees scored a third late on when the hosts failed to close down Yennaris.
Birmingham City boss Gianfranco Zola:
"This game is the most disappointing since I took over.
"We made mistakes and that is the consequence of what happens. If you do not control the tempo of the game the opposition will take over.
"That was the big problem and the disappointment for me was not to have control in the second half.
"I thought the first half was excellent when we produced some good football and scored a very good goal. But it is this fragility we need to improve."
Brentford boss Dean Smith:
"I told the players at half-time that although we were a goal down I didn't want to just get back into the game - I wanted them to win the match.
"We felt that if we could put pressure on them there would be an atmosphere here at Birmingham - they've had a change of manager and the team is in transition - and if we could get the crowd on their backs it would certainly help us.
"This occurred and the players operated with a lot of belief and deserved the three points."
