Fans of the Loch Ness Monster will be able to explore its "habitat" using Google Street View.

The US technology company has uploaded visuals taken on and beneath the loch's surface to its Street View website.
When searching the loch, users of the site will find Google's yellow Pegman icon changes to a Nessie "peg-monster".
The Loch Ness Street View has been launched on the same date a faked photograph of the monster was published in a newspaper in 1934.
Highly respected British surgeon, Col Robert Wilson, claimed he took his photograph days earlier while driving along the northern shore of Loch Ness.
It was later revealed to be a toy submarine outfitted with a sea-serpent head.
Google has also sought to draw attention to the project with a Nessie-themed Google Doodle on its search page.
Loch Ness expert Adrian Shine spent a number of days with the Google Street View and Catlin Seaview Survey teams as they performed an operation to photograph above and below the waters.
Mr Shine said the project was "cloaked in secrecy", adding: "When people asked about the ripples in the Loch during the special diving expeditions for once I had no opinion.
"I'm so proud to have been part of this initiative and I hope people worldwide enjoy exploring Street View to have a look and then be inspired to travel to Scotland to discover this area of magical beauty and natural intrigue. "
