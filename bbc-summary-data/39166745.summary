Thousands of revellers hit the streets for one of the world's largest gay and lesbian festivals - the Sydney Mardi Gras parade.
Organisers said about 250,000 people came out to watch the parade down Sydney's Oxford Street.
The annual parade began as a protest in the 1970s, but now has almost 200 floats and thousands of marching participants.
