[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inverness CT 1-1 Kilmarnock

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kilmarnock were left to rue missed chances as Inverness hit back for a share of the points at the Tulloch Caledonian Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Souleymane Coulibaly won and scored a penalty after a clumsy shove from defender Brad McKay.
Coulibaly had a shot blocked and headed over from close range, while Kris Boyd and Rory McKenzie both hit a post.
And Killie paid the price for those misses when an unmarked Lonsana Doumbouya levelled from close range.

The value of consecutive wins in the Scottish Premiership is there for all to see.
Kilmarnock were on course for that and a place in the top six. You'll imagine they'll feel hard done by, although credit to the home side for persevering when not at their best.
The visitors' performance resonated with the one that secured victory against St Johnstone last week, although in fairness they were more attacking in spells today.
Their goal came early and Coulibaly might have added a second minutes later when he failed to convert from six yards.
From there, they looked threatening going forward and managed to contain and frustrate their opponents.
There seems a solidity about Kilmarnock now and if they can get their more creative players on the ball they can hurt sides.
They certainly restricted the home side who were frustrated throughout, but will be delighted to have ended on level terms.
There hasn't been too much focus on Kilmarnock's forward thinking players, but in Jordan Jones, McKenzie and Coulibaly they possess significant talent.
Jones has great pace and it seems to posses a final ball to match that.
He came close to settling this on the break but was unlucky to see his effort deflected wide with substitute Boyd also unfortunate to see his shot deflect onto a post.
Kilmarnock's shape looks effective and is giving those up top the platform to perform and deliver important results at this stage of the season.
The win evaded them but similar performances will deliver reasonable success.

It looked like a damaging result for the home side before Doumbouya tapped home.
Yet again though, they delivered an equaliser late on after doing so against Hamilton and Celtic in recent games.
That shows spirit and determination.
Richie Foran will be concerned at an inability to build sustained pressure with their main striker Doumbouya a spectator for long spells.
Often, Inverness play with pace and get their wide players involved but that element of their play was sadly lacking with Jake Mulraney completely lacking service or impact.
Liam Polworth didn't offer much on the other side although did have a fabulous opportunity from seven yards, but inexplicably tried to square the ball when the shot was by far the best option.
Manager Richie Foran made changes but to little effect. Teams don't perform in every game but Inverness seemed to lack a plan B, however they did dig out a result when not playing at their best.
Kilmarnock though deserve credit for managing the game very well indeed.
Inverness' Richie Foran: "The spirit is always there but it was a bit of quality we were lacking today. Too many players had an off day.
"We gave away a silly penalty and gave ourselves a mountain to climb. We were lucky not to maybe go two down.
"We kept going, we created chances but our final ball was quite poor. Maybe it's a fair result.
"Lets give them (Kilmarnock) credit. They looked really good but we have to be better.
"I look at myself. Was my team-talk good enough. I'll go away and have a look at myself. I told the players they had an off day go and have a look at yourselves before you blame other people."
Kilmarnock's Lee Clark: "Very disappointed and it's a strange feeling because whenever you come away from home and get a point or three it's always a positive result.
"We've taken four points from two away games. In normal circumstances you'd be delighted with that.
"We were the dominant team from start to finish. We knew towards the end they'd commit bodies forward and take risks.
"We're frustrated at the goal we've given away. They deserved another clean sheet, we certainly deserved to win. We've hit the woodwork a couple of times as well.
"We're showing to people we are a strong team.
"It's learning to do what suits you as a group. Whenever we get positive results our work ethic is better than the oppositions.
"It was a quiet dressing room in there but it wasn't to be."
