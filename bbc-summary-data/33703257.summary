The slide will measure 178m (584ft) in length, 76m (249ft) in height and the descent, through transparent sections to see out, will take 40 seconds, said the park.
It will open in Spring 2016 and cost around Â£5.
Park officials said it would give a "different perspective" of the tower.
Peter Tudor, at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park said: "We are committed to ensuring our visitors have the best possible day out every time they visit, and as with all our venues, we are constantly exploring ways to ensure we lead the way with the latest visitor experience."
The decision was made at a Legacy Corporation Board planning meeting on Tuesday.
Turner Prize-winning artist Anish Kapoor and structural designer Cecil Balmond designed the tower for the 2012 Olympics.
