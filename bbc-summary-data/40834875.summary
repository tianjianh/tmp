Rochdale 1-1 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rochdale and Scunthorpe cancelled each other out by trading second-half goals in a League One draw.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side enjoyed the greater share of possession in the opening period, but home goalkeeper Josh Lillis was busier than Scunthorpe counterpart Matt Gilks, who did not have a save to make in the opening 45 minutes.
The Rochdale goal came under threat when a misjudged back pass by Jamie Allen from the halfway line looked short of legs, presenting an opportunity for Paddy Madden. Fortunately for Keith Hill's side, Lillis read the danger early and raced out of his area, winning the crucial challenge for the ball.
Lillis also saved well when Reece Brown's poor header let Josh Morris in down the left flank.
After the break, Dale improved with the introduction of striker Steven Davies and his diving header gave the home side the lead, the frontman meeting Ian Henderson's flick towards the back post.
It was a short-lived lead, however, as fellow sub Duane Holmes slipped a neat finish beneath Lillis.
