A scoping report has been submitted to the Scottish government on plans to build 42 wind turbines in the Lowther Hills in Dumfries and Galloway.

The North Lowther Energy Initiative is a partnership between Buccleuch and 2020 Renewables.
It would see the turbines constructed to the north west of Wanlockhead.
Buccleuch chief executive John Glen said the proposals were part of a "wider renewable energy and land use strategy" for the area.
The scoping report details the layout of the turbines and could pave the way for a full planning application.
"The submission of the scoping report to Scottish ministers marks the latest stage in the consultation process with local residents and stakeholders," said Mr Glen.
"We have received much valuable feedback which has already informed the design process and we hope this will continue to be built upon now and in the subsequent environmental impact assessment."
Alan Baker, managing director of 2020 Renewables, said the proposed design of the project had "steadily evolved" following initial feasibility studies and subsequent public consultation events.
"The feedback received has helped us arrive at a point where we believe we can develop a project that delivers for the local community as well as on environmental and energy targets," he said.
"There is an opportunity for further refinements to the scheme before a formal planning application is made and we will ensure that all future feedback is taken into account during these next stages."
