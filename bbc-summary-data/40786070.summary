[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Josh Rees and Louis Dennis in either half ensured the visitors followed up Saturday's goalless draw at Eastleigh in impressive fashion.
Rees opened the scoring in the 35th minute, the midfielder slotting home from Dennis' cutback, before the latter added a second in the 70th minute on the counter-attack after Ryan Bird's header was cleared off the line at the other end.
Dover set up a tense final 15 minutes when David Gregory bundled the ball into his own net following substitute Kadell Daniel's shot from a free-kick.
