It was the sixth time the NBA's third highest scorer had scored 60 points, beaten only by Wilt Chamberlain.
"You can't write something better than this," said 37-year-old Bryant, who helped the Lakers come from behind to beat Utah Jazz 101-96.
Basketball fans paid up to $27,500 (Â£19,315) to see Bryant's final game.
He attempted 50 shots on the night, the most by anyone in an NBA game in the last 30 seasons.

Farewell to the Mamba: Kobe Bryant
Bryant led the Lakers as they overturned a 20-point deficit at half-time, scoring 23 points in the fourth quarter of his 1,556th game with the team.
Bryant, who made his debut in November 1996, finished with 33,643 career points - third on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387) and Karl Malone (36,928).
He checked out with 4.1 seconds left and hugged former team-mate Shaquille O'Neal as a sell-out crowd at the Staples Center chanted: "Kobe! Kobe! Kobe!''
The 18-time All-Star, known as the 'Black Mamba,' told the crowd: "I can't believe how fast 20 years went by, this is crazy.
"What's funny is the fact I go through 20 years of everybody screaming to pass the ball, then the last night they're like 'don't pass it!'
"What can I say? Mamba out."
Bryant, who was voted Most Valuable Player in 2008, the same year he won the first of his two Olympic gold medals with the United States, added: "To carry on the legacy and tradition of all the great Lakers that came before - it's unfathomable. I can't express what a dream this is.

"I gave everything I could to the game, that's why I'm so comfortable walking away. I bared my soul to this game, I left it all here."
Reflecting on his final game and a remarkable comeback that produced a fairytale victory, Bryant continued: "All night long my team-mates were just continuing to feed me the ball, I just had to take the challenge.
"I tried to not watch the news, to just stay in the present because I didn't want to come out here and completely stink it up - which I did for the first five minutes!
"I was just like, 'OK, I've got to settle down'. Defensively I got some plays - I got some steals, I got a block - and that kind of got me into the game a little bit."
Lakers legend Magic Johnson had earlier told the crowd: "He never cheated us as fans. He has played hurt, and we have five championship banners to show for it."
US President Barack Obama joined in with the tributes, tweeting: "farewell for an all-timer".
