[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers v Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackburn Rovers midfielder Hope Akpan returns after a four-match suspension for Tuesday's visit of Cardiff City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rovers defender Elliott Ward (ankle) is training again and could return soon, but the match will come too soon for midfielder Corry Evans (groin).
Cardiff midfielder Aron Gunnarsson (illness) is hoping to be fit.
But striker Rickie Lambert (back), utility man Lee Peltier (ankle), defender Bruno Manga and midfielder Rhys Healey (both knee) all remain out.
