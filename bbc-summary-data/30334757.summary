Madonna topless photos criticised during a debate at Holyrood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Pop star Madonna has been criticised for doing a "disservice to women" during a Scottish Parliament debate on violence against women.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour MSP Elaine Murray said the behaviour of the singer should be "condemned", after she posed topless for a raunchy magazine shoot.
She described the 56-year-old star as a "silly exhibitionist".
Ms Murray's comments came as MSPs from all parties united to condemn violence against women.
During a debate in parliament, the Labour politician hit out at "that silly exhibitionist Madonna, who apparently is taking her breasts out for photographers".
She added: "She does a total disservice to women by continuing to collude with that objectification of women.
"That sort of behaviour needs to be condemned because it is doing women no good whatsoever."
