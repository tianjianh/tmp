Being in space weakens your muscles so the pair needed to be helped from their capsule after it landed at around 4.30am this morning.
Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station was twice the length of a normal stay.
Now that they're back home they'll take part in studies to learn about the effects of spaceflight on the body.
American space agency Nasa says the research will help them prepare to one day send humans to Mars.
