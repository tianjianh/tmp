Hull KR coach Chris Chester has denied reports that captain Terry Campese could miss half of the season.

The 31-year-old Australian has not played since June 2015 after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament.
"We're hopeful he'll be fit for the first rounds of Super League but we don't want to rush him back," Chester told BBC Radio Humberside.
"He certainly won't be missing half of the season as I've seen reported on some websites."

Chester added: "He's trained very, very well in Australia and when he is ready to go he will play.
"We were told it was a nine-month injury and that would take him to the end of January or the start of February."
The Robins coach is hopeful that youngster Matty Marsh, 20, can continue to impress should Campese miss the first few weeks of the season.
Marsh made six league appearances last season.
"The way Matty Marsh performed towards the back end of last season and in pre-season so far, it is going to be for difficult for Campo to get back in," Chester said.
"He is kicking the ball well, taking the line on and he defends well. Hopefully he is here for a few more years."
