The 40-year-old Italian is to end his 24-year playing career with Roma  - he is set to become a director at the only club he has played for.
He has scored 307 goals in 783 games since making his debut in 1993 aged 16.
"I can't tell you in a few words how much these colours meant, mean and will always mean to me," he tweeted.
"I just feel that my love for football never fades. It's a passion, my passion. It's so deep I can't imagine not fuelling it any longer. Ever.
"From Monday I'm ready to go again. I'm ready for a new challenge. Roma v Genoa, Sunday, 28 May 2017, the last time I can wear Roma's jersey."
Totti, a World Cup winner with Italy in 2006, has won one Serie A title and two Coppa Italias at Roma.
He was widely expected to quit playing last summer but signed a one-year extension to his contract.
This season he has made 27 appearances, mostly as a substitute. Roma are second in the table, four points behind newly-crowned champions Juventus before the final day of the season on Sunday.
The club's new sporting director Monchi had already revealed Totti was to retire from playing at the end of the season - but the player himself had until now remained silent on the matter.
"There is an agreement with the club that this will be his last year," Monchi said in early May.
"Then he will continue as a director. I want him on my side because he is Roma and can teach me what Roma is," the Spaniard added.
When Totti made his first Serie A appearance, in Roma's 2-0 win at Brescia on 28 March 1993, this is what was happening in the world:
