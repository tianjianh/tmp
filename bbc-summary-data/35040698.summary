The driver sustained minor injuries in the crash and was taken to hospital for a check-up.
The crash happened at a roundabout on Daniels Road, Norwich, at about 11:30 GMT.
Norfolk Fire and Rescue Service said all the turkeys were accounted for and the RSPCA was helping get them a "safe place".
Traffic was "snarled up" as a result of the crash, a BBC reporter at the scene said
The BBC understands the Bernard Matthews turkeys were heading from a farm to a factory.
Norfolk Police said diesel had spilt and entered drains in the road, close to Notcutts garden centre.
Scott Norman, from the fire service, said the turkeys looked "fine" and the RSPCA was helping to ensure they were "removed to a safe place".
"There's a lot of diesel gone on the floor and there's some livestock in the lorry, so we're ensuring its welfare," Mr Norman said.
A Bernard Matthews spokesman said: "The driver has been taken to hospital for a precautionary measure but we understand they have escaped relatively unscathed."
The RSPCA said an inspector had assessed the site and was happy the "turkeys' welfare is not in any further immediate danger".
BBC Radio Norfolk reporter Bob Carter said the lorry's windscreen was smashed in the crash, in which the vehicle hit a lamppost.
He said traffic was "very, very snarled up".
Norfolk Police said officers were diverting traffic on to Ipswich Road.
