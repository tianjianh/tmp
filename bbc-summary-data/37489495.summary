Steve Diamond's side completed a double over Leicester last season.
Tom Brady replaces injured JP Pietersen and starts on his Leicester debut against the side he left in the summer.
George McGuigan starts at hooker, with captain Tom Youngs dropping to the bench alongside prop Logovi'i Mulipola, who is set to make his debut.
With Youngs among the replacements, lock Ed Slater takes over as captain.
Dan Cole, Mike Williams and Ben Youngs - Leicester's three uninjured players who were named in Eddie Jones' 37-man training England squad ahead of the autumn Tests - are set to start for the Tigers at the AJ Bell Stadium.
Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond told BBC Sport:
"They're a good side as we know, a top-four team so we've got to be at our very best to challenge.
"We've been a bit inconsistent to be honest but we're probably no further away than we were the same time last year.
"We lost at home to Gloucester which we don't do very often and it has hurt us a little bit."
Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Leicester:
"We have the same approach this week. I don't think anything has to change - we can tweak our strategy for each team that we play.
"What set us apart at the weekend (beating Bath 34-14) was our physicality, our mindset, our passion and emotion around the game, which is hard to bring every week.
"We have to make sure that the players that take the field know their responsibilities playing for Leicester."
