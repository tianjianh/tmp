The hole, estimated to be about 15 ft (4.6m) deep, opened up in Hutcliffe Wood Road, Millhouses, on Sunday.
The route has been closed, with knock-on delays in the Abbeydale Road area.
Staff from Sheffield City Council have attended the scene, and engineers are assessing the extent of the damage. It is not yet known how long the road will remain closed.
BBC Look North reporter Phil Bodmer said people have speculated that old mine workings under the road may have become unstable.

Diversions have been put in place.
