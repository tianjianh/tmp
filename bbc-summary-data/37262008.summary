A man has been arrested after several shots were fired at a house in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident took place at Drumalee Park at about 17:25 local time. No one was injured.
After the attack, an attempt was made to set a car on fire but a man was arrested near the scene. Two firearms were also recovered by police.
Irish police believe the shooting may be connected to an ongoing feud between two criminal gangs in the city.
Eight people are believe to have died since February as a result of a violent dispute between the Hutch and Kinahan gangs.
The murder of Mr Hutch's brother Gary in Spain last year is believed to have been the first death in the feud.
