Morecambe 1-2 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Morecambe fell to a narrow 2-1 loss against Leyton Orient to suffer their first League Two defeat in five games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Shrimps, league leaders at the start of the day, began brightly but went a goal down in the 28th minute through Liam Kelly.
The midfielder picked up the ball 25 yards from goal and tried his luck with a right-footed curler that skidded off the greasy surface and bounced over Morecambe keeper Barry Roche.
The hosts levelled three minutes after the break with a stunner from Kevin Ellison. Jack Dunn did well for the Shrimps and teed up Ellison who let fly with a fierce right-footed drive which flew past Alex Cisak.
Orient regained the lead nine minutes later, though, with a huge stroke of luck. Jordan Bowery drilled in a low shot from the edge of the box and a deflection off Morecambe defender Alex Whitmore deceived Roche.
Bowery was denied a second on the hour mark with a close-range shot that was brilliantly blocked by Ryan Edwards while Roche also made excellent saves to deny Tom Parks and Bowery again late on.
