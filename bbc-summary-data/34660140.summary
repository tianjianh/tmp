Police are treating the death of the pupil - named locally as Bailey Gwynne - at Cults Academy as a murder inquiry.
Officers said a 16-year-old male had been detained after emergency services were called to the school at about 13:30.
Head teacher Anna Muirhead said the victim was "very gentle" and "caring" and pupils and staff were in a "state of total shock".
She added: "I think it is fair to say the whole school community is totally devastated but at the moment, of course, our thoughts are with the boy's family."
Ch Insp Graeme Mackie said: "This is a shocking and extraordinary incident for Aberdeen and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy."
He added: "A full and thorough inquiry is under way."
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter: "All my thoughts are with the family and friends of the young man who has tragically died at Cults Academy."
Aberdeen City Council leader Jenny Laing said: "I am deeply saddened by the news that one of our pupils has died following an incident at Cults Academy today.
"I am sure that I speak for everyone across the city when I say how shocking this is.
"I would like to offer my sincere sympathy to the boy's family and friends at this most difficult time."
Council chief executive Angela Scott added: "It is hard to find words to describe this tragic event. We are thinking first and foremost of this boy's family and friends at this extremely difficult time.
"At this point, it is too early for us to get into any further details.
"We will, of course, continue to work closely with Police Scotland and assist with their investigation as required. We will also initiate a full internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding this incident."
Aberdeen South MP Callum McCaig is a former pupil at Cults Academy.
He said: "I know the school extremely well and there is no precedent for anything like this happening.
"It's incredibly sad."
Mr McCaig added: "It's absolutely devastating news. I don't think words can really do justice to something like this.
