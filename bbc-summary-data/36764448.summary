The 21-year old played 24 times on loan at Hull last season as the Tigers earned promotion from the Championship.
"Newcastle is a massive football club and to be given the opportunity to come here is fantastic," said Hayden.
"I am still young but I want to get as many games under my belt as I can and help the team bounce back to the Premier League."
A graduate of Arsenal's academy, Hayden made his senior debut in September 2013 in a League Cup tie against West Bromwich Albion but made only one other appearance for the Gunners.
Speaking to the club website, the England Under-20 international continued: "Being at Arsenal was a great experience, I learned a lot there and have a lot to thank them for, but I needed to move on and so when Newcastle came in for me I jumped at the chance."
The Chelmsford-born defender, who can also play in midfield, has already joined up with the Magpies on their training camp in Ireland.
Newcastle manager Rafa Benitez added: "We continue with our plan to bring in players who are hungry to succeed and prove themselves, which Isaac really is."
"Isaac is a young, strong English player with fantastic potential but also with some experience already of the Championship. We welcome him to the club."
