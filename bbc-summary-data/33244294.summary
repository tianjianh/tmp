The statue of a Gurkha soldier will be erected on the site in Folkestone Garden of Remembrance in Sandgate Road later this year.
The Nepalese community in the town has raised more than Â£60,000 since 2009.
"It was a really long campaign and the people of Folkestone are really excited to have this unique Gurkha memorial statue," said organiser Dhan Gurung.
It is expected that the statue, by sculptor Rebecca Hawkins, will be unveiled in early October as one of the final acts of public commemoration of 200 years of Gurkha service to the UK.
The Royal Gurkha Rifles are based at Sir John Moore Barracks at Shorncliffe in Folkestone and many retired soldiers as well as friends and family have settled in the area.
"This is the right time to have this unveiling," said Mr Gurung.
"We are marking 200 years of sharing together between the British community and the Gurkha community."
