The 28-year-old, Serie A's top scorer with 30 goals, was dismissed for a second bookable offence in the 3-1 defeat at Stadio Friuli.
Higuain pushed the referee before his team-mates removed him from the pitch.
Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri has been banned for one game "for challenging the work of the match officials".
Napoli are six points behind leaders Juventus with seven matches remaining.
Higuain misses games against Hellas Verona, Inter Milan, Bologna and AS Roma.
