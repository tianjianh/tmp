On Friday, police received a report that a girl, missing from an independent care home, had been abused.
The girl, who had been moved to the home from another part of the UK, was reported missing again on Saturday.
Police found she had been taken to an address in the town and raped by a group of men. Officers believe the two incidents may be linked.
All six arrested men have been released on bail until 29 October.
The girl is being supported by police and specialist agencies.
In 2012, nine men from Rochdale and Oldham were jailed for crimes including rape, trafficking and child sex abuse, with sentences ranging from four to 10 years.
Five others were jailed in 2013 after an investigation in Rochdale into the sexual abuse of a girl was reopened.
Earlier this year, Greater Manchester Police apologised after a report highlighted failures "at individual and force level" into its dealings with victims from 2008-2010.
