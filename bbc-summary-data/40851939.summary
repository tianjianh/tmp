Jones, 28, joins the League One club having turned down the offer of a new deal at Stevenage, where he made 40 appearances last season.
The former Leyton Orient and Preston player will provide competition for Christian Walton, who is on a season-long loan from Brighton.
"Jamie is an excellent goalkeeper who is a natural shot-stopper and commands his area well," manager Paul Cook said.
