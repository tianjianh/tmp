One of the US swimmers caught up in a scandal over a made-up robbery at the Olympics says that he cannot explain team-mate Ryan Lochte's actions.

Gunnar Bentz was one of two swimmers who were pulled off a flight in Rio de Janeiro and questioned by police.
He apologised in a statement released by the University of Georgia.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the incident and the four athletes' behaviour.
Mr Lochte had claimed that he and a group of fellow US swimmers had been robbed at a petrol station.
But CCTV footage contradicted that story, showing the men had vandalised the petrol station.

Mr Bentz's account of the incident stressed that he was a witness, not a suspect. He said he had never made a false statement "to anyone at any time".
His account continued:
Mr Bentz apologised and said: "I regret this situation has drawn attention away from the Olympics, which have been hosted so incredibly well by Brazil and its citizens.
"Without question, I am taking away a valuable life lesson from this situation. In everything I do, I am representing my family, my country and my school. I will not take that responsibility lightly."

Lochte is one of the most successful swimmers in history, with 12 Olympic medals, and he once had his own reality television show in the US. In Rio, he swam in two events, winning gold in the 4x200m freestyle relay along with Conger.
Feigen won gold in the 4x100m freestyle relay.
Bentz competed in the 4x200m preliminaries, but not the final. He still received a gold medal after the US team's win.
