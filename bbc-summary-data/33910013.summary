Robert Morton, who the service said held similar posts in Northern Ireland and Australia, will start on 24 August.
Dr Anthony Marsh received a Â£232,000 salary for running EEAS and the West Midlands Ambulance Service, who he still works for.
Mr Morton's salary will be Â£142,200.
He has worked in the ambulance service for 25 years and said he was "thrilled" to be given the chief executive job.
"The service has been through some very difficult and challenging times over the last few years, but I am confident we can build on the good work that Anthony Marsh has put in place to further improve our services for patients and at the same time make this a even better place to work," he said.
Dr Marsh had been appointed to the EEAS in December 2013 and left his role on 5 August.
Sarah Boulton, trust chairman, thanked him for his work and said Mr Morton would be able to build on the progress made under his leadership.
"Robert is an experienced ambulance chief executive who will be able to connect immediately with frontline staff and volunteers thanks to his paramedic and volunteering background," she said.
