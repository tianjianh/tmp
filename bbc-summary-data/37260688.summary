[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's Richard Bland is tied for the lead at the European Masters after a second round six-under-par 64.

Staffordshire-born Bland, 43, is on nine under along with Frenchman Romain Langasque and Australian Richard Green.
Bland's compatriot Andrew "Beef" Johnston, eighth at this year's Open, is two shots adrift after a 68.
Masters champion Danny Willett, defending his title at the Crans-sur-Sierre course in Switzerland, is six shots back after a two-over par 72.
Willett - who will make his Ryder Cup debut at Hazeltine later this month - was challenging strongly before dropping six shots in three holes after the turn, including an eight at the par-four 12th.
His Europe team-mates, Englishmen Andy Sullivan and Matt Fitzpatrick, also enjoyed mixed fortunes.
Sullivan, who tied 12th at the 2016 Open, missed the cut - set at level par - by a stroke despite improving on Thursday's 74 with a 67.
But 22-year-old Fitzpatrick will play at the weekend after his second-round 65 moved him up to level par for the championship.
