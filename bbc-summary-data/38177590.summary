England v Australia: Eddie Jones has chip on his shoulder - Michael Cheika

Australia head coach Michael Cheika says England counterpart Eddie Jones has always "operated with a chip on his shoulder".

The former Randwick team-mates have exchanged frank views this week before Saturday's meeting at Twickenham.
Jones, 50, felt parts of the Australian media were disrespectful during England's tour down under in June.
"I don't know where that comes from. He is very respected in Australia," Cheika said.
England's victory over Argentina last weekend was their 13th in a row and their 12th under Jones - and a win over Australia in the final autumn international would equal their longest winning run, set across 2002 and 2003.
Australia's defeat by Ireland in Dublin ended the Wallabies' hopes of a grand slam over the home nations.
Cheika, 49, said fellow Australian Jones would always be respected in his homeland after his exploits as a coach with the national side in 2003.
"He is a good Australian coach who took Australia to a World Cup final when we didn't expect to go fantastic," Cheika added.
"He is respected for that. He certainly is by me as a former team-mate of his, and you saw when he was in Australia that he got a lot of respect.
"He has always operated with a chip on his shoulder and now there isn't a chip because things are going really well, he keeps looking for it."
Glen Ella, the former Wallaby who was England's backs coach on the summer tour, wrote this week that Cheika would still be having "nightmares" over Australia's 3-0 series defeat.
Cheika said: "I do not think Glen is working with England any more, so any Aussie who would support England against Australia, especially a guy who has played for the Wallabies, there's got to be a reason why.
"I don't know if he's bitter. Maybe they want to get us kicked out and have a job there."
This week, Cheika said Jones had tarnished his legacy in his native Australia because of comments made during the summer about the Australian media orchestrating a campaign against his side.
Jones said: "Michael Cheika has had a lot to say this week. I'm disappointed he's upset.
"He's made some comments about legacy. We don't have anything to do with legacy. It's an uncontrollable part of what happens so we're not perturbed about that.
"We'll have a cold beer after the game, so he's welcome to join us. I don't control his emotions.
"We believe that when we went on the Australian tour, staff and players behaved in a very respectful manner.
"But I'll reinforce again, I found the Australian media very disrespectful, so don't hide away from those comments."
