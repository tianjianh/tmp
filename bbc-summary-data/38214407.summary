Prisons dispute: Union accuses ministers of mind games

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ministers are "playing mind games" in the dispute over pay and conditions, the Prison Officers Association says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It said the Ministry of Justice was wrong to claim proposals agreed by its leaders had been on offer before a day of staff action in England and Wales.
The union said the offer had been "improved" and had 25 alterations.
The justice secretary had said the deal now being put to a ballot "rightly recognises the hard work and dedication of officers... doing a tough job".
Up to 10,000 prison officers stopped work on 15 November over claims of a "surge in violence" among inmates in jails, but returned to work after a High Court injunction ordered them to end their 24-hour protest.
The POA said it took issue with a government press release issued on 1 December, which said in an addendum that the proposals now being put to a membership ballot had been "on offer before industrial action" and have "not been improved".
The POA said it believed the Ministry of Justice "are playing mind games at a crucial time for industrial relations with the POA membership".
POA general secretary Steve Gillan said: "The Prison Service and secretary of state know that we didn't take protest action on the grounds of pay and pensions and that the action was purely on health and safety grounds."
He added: "It may well be that management are using a tactic to anger the membership so they reject the package on pensions.
"They can withdraw it and blame the POA membership, and government can then impose a lesser pay award with their appointed and paid-for pay review body."
Under the government offer, prison officers will be allowed to retire at 65 - up to three years ahead of the current state pension age - at no cost to them and with full pension benefits.
Uniformed staff will also be given consolidated pay rises of between 0.5% and 1% for each of the next three years, on top of usual performance-related pay increases.
They also stand to receive a "recognition and retention" package totalling Â£1,000.
Justice Secretary Liz Truss had earlier unveiled proposals detailing Â£1.3bn investment in new prisons over the next five years, including plans for 2,100 extra prison officers, drug tests for inmates on entry and exit from prisons, and more autonomy for governors.
The Ministry of Justice has been contacted for a response to the POA's claim.
