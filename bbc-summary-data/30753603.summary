Loud explosions were heard at the site of a siege at a Jewish supermarket in Paris on Friday afternoon.
Shortly after, a number of people, believed to have been hostages, were seen fleeing accompanied by police.
Other images showed children apparently escaping from the supermarket siege.
In Dammartin-en-Goele, where two suspects in the Charlie Hebdo shootings were holding at least one hostage, explosions were also heard. The two suspects were killed and their hostage escaped, police said.
After the explosions, police were seen on the roof of the building where the siege was taking place.
There are reports a number of people have been killed during siege in Paris. Ambulances were seen at the site.
Police had closed a number of streets around the supermarket in eastern Paris before officers stormed the site.
As darkness fell the phrase Paris is Charlie was projected onto the Arc de Triomph in the centre of the capital.
