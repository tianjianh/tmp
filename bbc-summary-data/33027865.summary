Jobs report depresses US shares

(Close): The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 closed lower on Friday, despite a much better than expected jobs report.

The Labor Department said that 280,000 new jobs were created in May. The strong figure made investors nervous as it makes a Federal Reserve interest rate rise in September more likely.
The Dow Jones fell 57 points, to 17,848.3 and the S&P 500 fell three points, to 2,092.83.
However, the Nasdaq managed to gain nine points to stand at 5,068.46.
The jobs data "certainly puts more ammunition in the Fed's plan to start lift-off in September," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.
"It makes sense that the market would fall off on that, but this is good news."
Investment banks rose on expectation of the earlier rate rise. JP Morgan Chase was the Dow's biggest riser, up 1.64%, followed by Goldman Sachs, up 0.76%.
But most other sectors fell, with telecoms giant Verizon Communications falling 1.81%. - the Dow's biggest loser.
On the currency markets, the US dollar rose 0.58% against sterling to 0.6546, and 1.14% against the euro to 0.8999.
