Howard Wilson, from Dumfries, died after colliding with another car on the A6094 in Midlothian on 2 October.
The driver of the other car, 68-year-old Irene Robson, from Peebles, was also killed in the crash.
Mr Wilson's family said the 41-year-old was a "much-loved son, brother and adored daddy". Police are still investigating the cause of the crash.
Officers said they were particularly keen to speak to those who stopped at the scene immediately after the collision if they had not already spoken to police.
The crash happened between Leadburn and Howgate at about 13:00 on 2 October.
In a statement, the family said: "It is with great sadness that we announce Howard's death. Howard was a very much loved son, brother and adored daddy.
"Howard had great friends and he will be fondly remembered for his love of music, life and family time.
"We would like to say thank you to all friends and family who have contacted us offering their kind wishes."
