The facility would be located at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton.
It is being built by the Macmillan charity and is part funded with a donation from local businessman Sir Robert Ogden.
If planning permission is granted, building work on the new centre could begin this summer, with the project due to be completed by 2018.

The building would house a chemotherapy treatment lounge to treat up to 35 patients a day, treatment and consulting rooms and therapy facilities.
Paul McCavana, Macmillan head of services for the North, said: "This is a fantastic opportunity to provide a state-of-the art cancer care facility, all under one roof, for people in and around Northallerton.
"It will provide a space for patients to have all their needs assessed, not just physical and clinical, but their financial, emotional and psychological needs too."
