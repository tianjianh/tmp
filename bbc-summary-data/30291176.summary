Tickets for the three week run went on sale at 10:00 on Monday and by lunchtime more than a 100,000 had been sold.
The event - which will feature 1,200 performers from five continents - will have an east meets west theme in 2015.
The Tattoo, which runs between 7 and 29 August, plans to target audiences in China and India.
Brigadier David Allfrey, The Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo's chief executive and producer, said: "It has been an extraordinary few hours.
"It is phenomenal when our tickets go on sale and within minutes we have high demand across the world.
"This year, to add to the mix, we are trying to touch new markets and hope very much to encourage an increase in Chinese and Indian visitors.
"The plans for the show are coming together nicely and we have lots of treats in store."
