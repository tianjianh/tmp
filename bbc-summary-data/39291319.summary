Joshua, 14, and collie cross German shepherd Biscuit, three, were the overall winners in the Scruffts award for crossbreeds at the event.
More than 1,400 people entered Scruffts regional heats around the UK in 2016, with Joshua triumphing in the good citizen dog scheme category.
In the final at Crufts at Birmingham's NEC, he won the overall Scruffts title.
This involved beating winners of five other categories such as most handsome dog, golden oldie, best rescue and child's best friend.
"I'm very happy with the way Biscuit performed and I hope I did everything right." said Joshua, from Prestatyn.
"He's lovely with humans and loves everybody. He likes other dogs and think everyone wants so be his best mate."
