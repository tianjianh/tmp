The RSC's stage adaptations of Dame Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies are to move to Broadway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The original cast, which includes Ben Miles and Nathanial Parker, are expected to appear in the shows, to be renamed Wolf Hall: Parts 1 and 2.
The plays are based on Dame Hilary's Booker Prize-winning fictional accounts of Thomas Cromwell's rise to power in the court of Henry VIII.
The Broadway productions will open at the Winter Garden Theater next March.
The plays were first staged at the Royal Shakespeare Company's theatre in Stratford-Upon-Avon and are on at the Aldwych Theatre in London's West End until Saturday 4 October.
The company of more than 20 actors is headed by Ben Miles as Thomas Cromwell, Lydia Leonard as Anne Boleyn and Nathaniel Parker as Henry VIII.
A BBC adaptation of the books is due to be broadcast next year, starring Homeland actor Damian Lewis as the monarch opposite Mark Rylance as Cromwell.
The cast for the six-part mini-series will also include Mark Gatiss and Jonathan Pryce.
