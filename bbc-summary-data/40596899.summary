[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dog wardens in Conwy county scrap fines for advice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dog owners in Conwy county who take their pets to off-limit beaches will be issued with advice instead of on-the-spot fines.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dog wardens will only issue fines to owners who ignore requests to remove their pet or put it on a lead.
A council meeting heard an elderly lady was reluctant to walk her dog after receiving a fine.
Cllr Mike Priestley told the meeting: "She doesn't want to go out with her dog any more.  Surely that's not good."
Private company Kingdom Security will continue to patrol dog control and dog exclusion areas.
