Crawley Town 1-1 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Chris Porter hit a dramatic 88th-minute equaliser as Colchester forced a 1-1 draw at Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adi Yussuf gave the hosts a first-half lead on his first home league start for the club, but Porter ensured a share of the points by smashing the ball into the roof of the net from the edge of the area.
Striker Yussuf, who scored one and made the other two in Crawley's 3-2 win at Morecambe last Saturday, gave the hosts the lead in the 17th minute.
Former Chelsea youngster Kaby Djalo began the move with an excellent cross-field pass and Dutchman Enzio Boldewijn played the ball into Yussuf who beat keeper Sam Walker with a deft finish.
Crawley defender Lewis Young picked up a booking for bringing down Tariq Fosu on the edge of the area and Craig Slater put the resulting free-kick over.
Slater had a long-range shot easily saved by keeper Glenn Morris shortly before the interval as Colchester struggled to impose themselves.
United midfielder Sammie Szmodics got into a good position inside the area on the hour, but put an angled shot across the face of the goal.
Szmodics threatened again when his goal-bound header was turned onto the post by keeper Morris.
Colchester applied late pressure and were rewarded when Porter lashed home his fourth of the season.
