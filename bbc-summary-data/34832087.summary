[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian McCulloch, 39, beat, kicked and repeatedly smashed a claw hammer over the knees of Michael Deeley in Dalmuir, West Dunbartonshire, on 14 June.
His co-accused, 24-year-old Robert Young, was jailed for three years after he admitted taking part in the attack.
Both men were caught after being identified from CCTV footage.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that McCulloch has 29 previous convictions, including offences of assault and disorder.
He and Young both admitted assaulting Mr Deeley by repeatedly punching, kicking and stamping on his head and body and repeatedly hitting him with a hammer to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Jailing McCulloch, judge Lord Turnbull told him he was the prime mover in the attack.
"You repeatedly hit Mr Deeley on the knee with a hammer in a deliberate attempt to maim him," the judge said.
"Your aim was to prevent him giving evidence against you in another case.
"Surprisingly, the injuries were not nearly as serious as one would imagine they would be."
The judge told McCulloch that, but for his early plea of guilty, he would have been jailed for seven years.
Lord Turnbull told Young: "This offence shows an escalating rate of criminal conduct, however, your role was different from that of Mr McCulloch."
Young was also told he would be monitored in the community for a year after his release.
The court heard that the attack happened at the victim's home after both accused had banged and kicked on the door.
Mr Deeley, thinking it was the police trying to force entry to his home, opened the door.
As soon as he did, McCullough and Young launched a frenzied attack on him.
Neighbours heard Mr Deeley screaming in pain and McCullough shouting : "You know who I am don't you."
The attack lasted about 10 minutes, during which McCullough used a claw hammer to repeatedly hit the victim on the kneecaps and then on his hands.
The court heard that the two accused were captured on CCTV and were later identified by Mr Deeley who was taken to hospital for treatment.
He was discharged the following day with painkillers.
