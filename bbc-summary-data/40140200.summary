County Championship: Daryl Mitchell inspires Worcestershire after Sussex run riot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire make a fine response to Sussex's declaration on 579-8, reaching 139-0 by the close of play at Hove.

Having resumed on 339-3, Luke Wells went on to make 155 and Luke Wright finished on 87 before Sussex finally declared on 579-8.
David Wiese (66) and Michael Burgess (46) also weighed in down the order.
But the Worcestershire openers remained unparted in the 44 overs they faced before the close, Daryl Mitchell leading the way with 85 out of 139-0.
After Sussex had declared 12 overs before tea, Mitchell, chasing a third first-innings ton in as many games, was well supported by Brett D'Oliveira's 43.
This is their second century opening partnership in three matches, having also put on 243 in the win over Derbyshire - and both have already survived missed chances.
Earlier, Worcestershire captain Joe Leach finished with 3-101, while Ed Barnard took 3-120 and Australian Test spinner Nathan Lyon toiled 40 overs in all to take 1-123.
Sussex coach Mark Davis:
"Luke Wells did superbly again for his 155 but all the way down the order there were good contributions. It was hard work at the start but Harry Finch set the innings up for us and it was great to see Luke Wright in the runs again, playing with freedom.
"I must admit I did expect the ball to do a bit more on that wicket than it has. We bowled well and made good use of the short ball but their openers have got stuck in.
"We can still win the game, definitely. They're still a long way off the follow-on target and the second day at Hove is normally the best day for batting. We'll dust ourselves down and go again."
Worcestershire bowling coach Matt Mason told BBC Hereford & Worcester:
"We've come out of the day really well. When you've been in the field for nearly 150 overs that's tough, so for Daryl and Brett to come out and bat in the way they did was outstanding.
"Sussex bowled really well with the new ball. It was tough to get through it. One or two balls misbehaved at the sea end, but the wicket is still pretty good.
"When you concede the score we did there is always going to be pressure but we have responded and hopefully we can build on it. They have given us a good chance of getting something out of this game."
