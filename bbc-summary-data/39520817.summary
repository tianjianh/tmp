Laura Ashley boss to pay ex-wife £64m divorce settlement

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former wife of a Laura Ashley boss should receive a £64m divorce settlement, a judge has ruled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pauline Chai, 70, of Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, wanted half their assets, which she claimed were worth at least £205m.
Her ex-husband Khoo Kay Peng argued she should receive about £9m, following the end of their 42-year marriage.
Mr Justice Bodey said Ms Chai's settlement should be made up of cash and property.
More than £6m has been spent on lawyers since their marriage broke down.
The couple, who both come from Malaysia, married in 1970 and have five children.
The hearing was heard at the Family Division of the High Court in London, where earlier Mr Justice Bodley had told them they could live in "considerable comfort" if they settled their differences.
Dr Khoo, who is a non-executive chairman of Laura Ashley Holdings, had wanted their divorced to be settled in Malaysia, which he said was their marital home.
But Ms Chai successfully argued the pair had moved their home to Berkhamsted before separating, entitling her to have the case heard in England.
