Chris Matheson becomes MP for the constituency, with Conservative Stephen Mosley losing out by just 93 votes.
Chancellor George Osborne increased his majority in Tatton, with the Conservative taking a 58.6% share of the vote.
Mr Osborne tweeted: "Honoured to represent people of Tatton for the next 5 years.
"Will always seek to represent whole community, regardless of how people voted."
Outside the Chester city walls, the Conservatives held all their Cheshire seats, with Crewe & Nantwich, Congleton, Macclesfield, Weaver Vale, Eddisbury and Warrington South all remaining resolutely blue.
Warrington North was a hold for Labour, with Helen Jones increasing her majority. The party also held Halton and Ellesmere Port & Neston.
