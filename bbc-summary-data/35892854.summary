[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Historical gold and silver rings found in Pembrokeshire have been declared treasure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A late-16th Century silver-gilt ring was found in Carew in 2013 by Kevin Higgs, who found a decorative 14th Century gold ring in Pembroke in 2014.
Philip Jenkins unearthed a silver-gilt "faith" ring in Lamphey in 2013, along with a gold religious finger-ring in Llandissilio a year later.
Museums in Milford Haven, Tenby and Narberth hope to acquire the rings.
Mark Redknap, of Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, said the rings were "significant additions to the growing database of treasure cases from Wales".
