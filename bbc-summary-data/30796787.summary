Crawley Town sign Brazilian keeper Evandro Rachoni de Lima

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Crawley Town have signed Brazilian goalkeeper Evandro Rachoni de Lima on non-contract terms.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old has spent the bulk of his career in Brazil, but has also had spells in Angola and Ukraine.
Crawley have just one senior keeper on their books at the moment, with no recognised back-up to Brian Jensen.
The 39-year-old sustained a thumb injury against MK Dons on Saturday and striker Matt Harrold was forced to play in goal for over 50 minutes.
Rachoni, who has recently spent time with non-league London Bari, has been included in the Crawley squad to face Conference South side Whitehawk in the Sussex Senior Cup on Tuesday.
