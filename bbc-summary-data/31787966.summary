Nick Bain, from Clacton in Essex, found the unexpected item while unpacking the groceries in his kitchen.
The mouse disappeared into a gap, where it hid for two days, Mr Bain said.
Tesco refunded and replaced his shopping, sent in pest controllers to catch the mouse and carried out a "thorough check of the store".
Mr Bain said he had noticed something stirring in a bag after he took delivery of the online order on Thursday evening.
"I was going through the bag and I didn't realise, and when I put my hand in I saw something move," said the 41-year-old.
"I told my wife there was a mouse in the bag and she jumped off the floor.
"It was just so fast. It's the last thing you expect with a delivery."
Mr Bain said the mouse ran into a gap in his kitchen, which is currently being refitted.
He said you could hear it "scratching for two nights solid" until it was discovered in a trap.
"It disgusted my wife. It makes you think: if it was in the van, whose other bags had it been in?
"To be fair to Tesco, they gave us some flowers and some treats for the dogs and sent Rentokil around, they've been pretty good."
A Tesco spokesman said: "We've apologised to Mr Bain and the local online food shopping manager has visited him to deliver flowers and a replacement order as a gesture of goodwill.
"A thorough check of the store by pest control found no evidence of further problems, so we're still investigating to find out exactly what happened."
