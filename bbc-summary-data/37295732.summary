Race play's 'universal' message

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When, two years ago, the play Father Comes Home from the Wars premiered in New York, it received rave reviews. Now the author Suzan-Lori Parks is in London to make the play work for British audiences.  But she points out it's actually three plays - with much more to come.

In 2002, Suzan-Lori Parks won a Pulitzer Prize for her play Topdog/Underdog.  She remembers suddenly getting a lot of attention as a writer.
"I did an interview with Charlie Rose on TV," she says.  "And he said: 'Hey you're an overnight success'.  I told him yes - but it's been a long night.
"I think almost no writers are overnight successes.  Winning an award is always a combination of many things."
But that play, which in New York starred Don Cheadle and Jeffrey Wright, made Parks's name.  The following year it travelled to the Royal Court in London and now she's back at the same venue with the play Father Comes Home from the Wars.
It's set in and around the American Civil War and President Lincoln's proclamation of 1863, which was a huge step towards the abolition of slavery.  But it's hardly a traditional historical epic.  Actually, it's three separate plays.
Sitting over a lunchtime sandwich, Suzan-Lori (the z was a misprint which somehow stuck) says she tries not to talk much about the unusual structure.
"In fact, the play I wrote first is now the final play of the three.  But there are six other plays waiting to take the story on.  They're in different stages of completion and some of them are in very bad drafts.
"As a writer I rewrite.  But basically they'll come up to the present day - or at least much nearer to it.  I think a little perspective is good so maybe they'll stop in the 1950s or '60s."
The central character of Hero has been promised his freedom from servitude in 1860s America - but to secure it he'll need to fight alongside his master for the pro-slavery Confederate side.  The story owes something to the classical epic the Odyssey, though that's only one influence.
Parks is no stranger to experimenting with form.  A decade ago she wrote 365 Days/365 Plays for which she forced herself to write a play a day for a year.
"Some were long and some very short.  For instance there was one called Lickety Split, in which a woman runs on stage and licks a man from head to toeâ€¦ and then she splits.  Some of the other plays are so long they still may be running - who knows?"
The new play investigates how people reacted to their own freedom - a topic Parks thinks is still relevant today.
"How does one respond to the notion of freedom?" she asks. "Most of us in the western world are free yet we are constrained also.  We are tied down to things and the question of how we exercise the freedom we have is complex.
"Freedom often is not something your master can grant you.  I think it's something you grant yourself."
So does the fact that Parks is herself African-American add a potency to the play's themes?
"Well, first I am specific but then I am universal.  There are issues which are individual to me as an 'African-American woman person' - but there are questions we all wrestle with today, whoever we are.  We're all wondering what that word, freedom, means.
"So in this play the characters are asking, 'Who am I and what am I doing here?  And what are we to each other?'"
Her writing is regularly praised for its wit and lack of predictability.  Her approach to dialogue is sparky and unusually adventurous - so does she, as a successful black playwright, want to find new ways of using African-American speech interestingly on stage?
"I am interested in language, certainly, but I am always interested in people first.  I love my people - but I also just love people.  Making African-American characters use language interestingly is important to me. It's my job but also it's my calling and my joy.  But I want to put us all on stage."
The play has a very American setting but Parks says she's delighted with the cast in London.  "The accent I asked for is what they call General American, so there's no temptation to slip into a southern drawl.  When we did our first stumble-through of the script I wept it was so good.
"We have actors of African descent and of European descent but I've been really impressed how they've all found themselves in the stories on stage."
After London, Parks is not getting a holiday.  She's working on a stage musical adaptation of the 1972 reggae film The Harder They Come and there's a novel, plus a project for Amazon.  And there's a band called Sula and the Noise and a young son.
Then Parks remembers something else. "And there are the other Father Comes Home plays as well.  I have to find time for six of them somewhere."
Father Comes Home from the Wars is at the Royal Court theatre in London from 15 September.
