Alcohol and Drugs Action (ADA) said the Green Light Project (GLP) - funded by Comic Relief - was for those aged up to 25 in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
It will include advice on the safer use of social media.
ADA said sexual exploitation could lead to alcohol and drugs problems in later life.
Chief executive Luan Grugeon said: "We know that child sexual exploitation can lead to young people developing a whole range of problems as they grow up, including problems with alcohol and drugs to cope with the trauma they have experienced.
"I am really pleased that we are able to launch this project which will prevent and protect young people from being sexually exploited in the local area".
Hannah Bennet, a young people's worker delivering the service, said: "I am really excited to be a part of this new service.
"It is so important to keep raising awareness of child sexual exploitation, especially because this form of abuse can happen entirely online now.
"We need to make sure we are keeping up with technology and protecting young people from the risks posed by an increasingly connected and accessible world".
