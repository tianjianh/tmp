The 58-year-old man and 56-year-old woman were riding on a Harley Davidson motorbike when it was involved in the crash on Sunday afternoon.
Police said the bike collided with a black Land Rover Freelander on the A76 near Sanquhar at about 13:15.
Officers have appealed for help from witnesses to the accident, near the road to Kellofoot Cottages.
Sgt Bob McNay said  "As a result of this tragic collision the road was closed for nearly eight hours while officers carried out a full crash scene investigation.
"We are still appealing for witnesses to this collision and would ask that anyone who can help call Police Scotland at Lockerbie on the 101 number."
He said the victims would be publically identified once relatives had been informed.
