The death of a former North Wales Police superintendent who sexually abused two boys will bring victims "some closure", a charity boss has said.

But Joy Dyment, north Wales director of Stepping Stones, said Gordon Anglesea's death on Thursday would also "reawaken" the abuse some suffered.
Anglesea, 79, of Old Colwyn, Conwy, died six weeks into a 12-year sentence.
Ms Dyment said it was "the end of a very dark era in north Wales' history".
Anglesea was  arrested in 2013 as part of the National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial investigation into historical abuse across north Wales.
He was jailed in November after being found guilty of one charge of indecent assault against one boy and three indecent assaults against another following a six-week trial.
The boys were abused between 1982 and 1987 when they were 14 or 15.
He had lodged an appeal against his convictions.
Anglesea was serving his sentence at HMP Rye Hill in Northamptonshire when it is believed he became ill several days ago and was admitted to hospital.
He died at about 09:30 GMT on Thursday.
A Prison Service spokesman added: "As with all deaths in custody, the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman will investigate."
Stepping Stones worked with the Operation Pallial team, the Ministry of Justice and other agencies to support and counsel victims of childhood sexual abuse.
Ms Dyment said: "I guess for many victims this will bring some closure and it will be the end of a very dark era in north Wales' history.
"But for others it will re-awaken the effect of losing their childhoods through a terrible, sustained sexual abuse that they endured."
