A 10-year-old school girl's bid to have better signage on the doors of disabled toilets has won praise from MSPs.

Grace Warnock was keen to highlight that easily accessible toilets were not just for wheelchair users.
So the Prestonpans youngster, who has the bowel disease Crohn's, designed a door sign indicating the needs of people not visibly disabled.
Labour MSP Iain Gray is now supporting Grace's Sign campaign and will praise it in the Holyrood chamber.
The politician will lead a members' debate titled "World Toilet Day, We Can't Wait".
Mr Gray, an East Lothian MSP, said: "The debate will enable me to put Grace's campaign on the agenda at Holyrood as well as highlight the work that still needs to be done globally to achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all."
He added that Grace had already made "considerable progress", including coming up with her own new design for door signs.
