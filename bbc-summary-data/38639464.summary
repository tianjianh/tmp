Torquay United manager Kevin Nicholson says he is frustrated by his side's inability to take their form on the training ground into matches.

The Gulls lost 2-1 at home to fellow strugglers Woking, their third game without a win.
"We're becoming a training team, an academy type team," Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"If you came to watch them in the week you'd think you were watching one of the top teams," he said.
"The way they move the ball, the way they pass it, the way they move, everything's quick and precise and proper, we need to take that out onto the pitch.
"Instead what you get is doubt, slow passing, second guessing what they're about to do and then doing it too late, lumping it up to two forwards and obviously we haven't got that physical presence right now and that's something we're working on."
Nicholson believes his side has a weak mentality on the pitch once something goes against them, adding: "We're becoming one of those teams where the slightest thing goes against you, all of a sudden you go from being absolutely at it and looking like you're ready to go, to falling apart.
"We've gone from making one of the best footballing teams in the league in Forest Green looking very average to making two of the teams that are struggling at the other end looking absolutely fantastic and that's just not acceptable."
