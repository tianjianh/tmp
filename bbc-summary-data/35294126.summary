A man with a grudge against police has been jailed for throwing a stone slab through a police car's windscreen as officers responded to a 999 call.

Jason Gamble hurled the missile from a bridge above Coventry ring road on 15 February, narrowly missing the officers but cutting their faces.
He disliked police due to his arrest at a football match and having restricted access to his children, police said.
Gamble was jailed for eight years at Warwick Justice Centre on Monday.
He was found guilty of damaging property with intent to endanger life in November.
The 45-year-old, who lived in a hostel in Harnall Lane West in Coventry, was identified by CCTV footage.
West Midlands Police said it showed Gamble, who was wearing clothing matching that worn by a man on the footbridge, leave the hostel at 22:00 GMT on the day of the attack and return about 20 minutes later.
"Anti-police" messages were later found on his phone and officers subsequently discovered he had recently been arrested for kicking a wing mirror off a police car parked outside the address.
He had also been arrested at a Coventry City football match for throwing a bottle onto the pitch a month before the incident, and he blamed authorities for a social care matter that restricted access to his children.
Gamble told police a side effect of medication he was taking caused memory loss and he could not account for his movements at the time.
Det Insp Stuart Bell said it was a serious attack on officers in a marked police car in the course of their duty. One officer later needed treatment to remove glass fragments from his eyes.
"Given the size of the coping stone, and the impact it made on the car, it's incredibly fortunate neither officer was seriously hurt," he said.
