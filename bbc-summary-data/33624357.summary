Jessica Lawson, from Wolfreton School, near Hull, was taken to hospital in Limoges by air ambulance on Tuesday afternoon.
A member of staff at Le Maury activity centre said the incident took place on the beach by a lake.
French radio reports have said Jessica was among a group jumping from a pontoon which had overturned.
It had then trapped some children beneath it.
Writing on Facebook, her sister Polly said: "We are in France doing everything we can to get her back into the country. All of your thoughts are appreciated at this time.
"Remember who she was and not who she could have been, it is important to respect and cherish there memories we had with her.
"Thanks everyone again."
Jessica had reportedly spent several days at the centre before her death.
Twenty four students and three staff were on the trip in the Massif Central region of France.
Head teacher Dave McCready said it was a "dreadful shock" to the whole school.
He added: "The parents and sister of [Jessica] are now in France and our heartfelt thoughts and prayers go to the family at this very difficult time.
"As a parent myself I only begin to imagine the pain felt by her parents and family at her death at such a young age."
Mr McCready said the rest of the students on the trip were being cared for by staff from the school and the activity centre.
"The school staff in France have the situation in hand and have been joined by two senior staff from the school, who travelled overnight to the activity centre site to provide further support."
He said the French authorities had already begun an investigation into what had happened and were interviewing the rest of the group.
"Once this procedure is completed plans will be implemented to bring the group home as soon as possible, " he said.
Jessica and the rest of the group had left for France on 18 July and had been due to return home on Thursday.
Steve Scott, managing director of trip organiser Activ4, said the group were swimming after activities scheduled by adventure camp staff had concluded.
He said: "A senior member of Activ4 staff is currently in Meymac, liaising with the adventure centre owners and staff, local authorities and French police, and providing support and assistance to teachers and students affected by the incident."
The East Riding of Yorkshire Council said it was also providing close support to the school and to the student's family and arrangements were being made for the school party to return home.
Mike Furbank, head of schools at the council, said: "There will be a full investigation into the incident and it would be inappropriate to comment further about the details of these tragic events, which the authorities in France are looking into."
The adventure centre, according to its website, has been operating for about 25 years and specialises in activities such as kayaking, canoeing, sailing and boarding as well as climbing, mountain biking and orienteering.
