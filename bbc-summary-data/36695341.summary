Wimbledon 2016: People's Sunday features Serena Williams & Nick Kyrgios

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Serena Williams continues her women's title defence as Wimbledon stages a People's Sunday for only the fourth time after a rain-disrupted first week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Williams faces Annika Beck in the third round on Centre Court, with play starting at 11:30 BST on all courts.
The 22,000 tickets were sold within 27 minutes of going on sale on Saturday.
The weather forecast is for a dry day as organisers aim to complete all third-round matches to get the singles events back on schedule.
There are six men's singles and six women's singles matches in that round still to be completed.
The middle Sunday is traditionally a rest day and it has only seen play before in 1991, 1997 and 2004.
Gates will open at 08:45.
Defending champion Williams is one of the players who has particularly suffered through the rain that blighted the first week and faces having to play four matches in five days to reach the final.
In contrast, elder sister Venus secured her place in the last 16 on Friday and will enjoy a weekend free of singles action.
In the second match on Centre Court, Serena faces 22-year-old German Beck, who saved three match points to defeat Britain's Heather Watson in round one.
They follow Coco Vandeweghe and Roberto Vinci who open proceedings on Centre.
There is sure to be plenty of entertainment on Court One as Nick Kyrgios and Feliciano Lopez resume tied at one set all with the winner facing Andy Murray in round four.
As usual with Kyrgios, there was drama in the two sets played so far with the Australian taking a medical timeout for a nosebleed, before he immediately broke the Spaniard and went on to take the first set.
He angrily shouted at his support staff as he fell a break behind in the second set and although he eventually forced a tie-break, Lopez took it to level the match.
They resume as the second match on Court One following the women's singles between Svetlana Kuznetsova and Sloane Stephens.
In addition to Kyrgios-Lopez, there are three other men's singles matches which resume after being halted by bad light on Saturday.
American John Isner leads France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 6-7 (5-9), while another Frenchman, Richard Gasquet, is two sets to one up on Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas, 2-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-2.
Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, who knocked out Stan Wawrinka in round two, trails France's Lucas Pouille 6-7 (4-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-5.
German 19-year-old Alexander Zverev faces 2010 finalist Tomas Berdych in the third match on Centre Court, while Jiri Vesely and Joao Sousa are third on Court One.
