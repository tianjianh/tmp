The 1970s boy band will perform live on stage at the Old Fruitmarket in Glasgow, where presenter Jackie Bird will be hosting Hogmanay Live 2015.
Lead singer Les McKeown and band members Alan Longmuir and Stuart 'Woody' Wood will be performing hits such as Shang-a-Lang and Bye Bye Baby.
Jackie Bird said she was a Rollers fan when she was a teenager.
She said: "If I'd known when I was 15 that I'd get to introduce the Bay City Rollers on live telly, I'd have thought all my Christmases had come at once.
'We're thrilled to have them on the show - they're a perfect fit for Hogmanay.
"Their music crosses the generation gap and their legendary anthems will keep the party going wherever you are. We've got a great night's entertainment lined up."
The Hogmanay show will also feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain, who will oversee the countdown to a year that will mark some important milestones for the musical pair.
In 2016, Aly turns 70 and the duo mark 30 years since their first musical collaboration.
Turbo-charged 13-piece supergroup Treacherous Orchestra will also throw their unique energy into the mix.
Choral Stimulation, the Scottish-based acapella group that wowed audiences on BBC Two's Naked Choir, will be adding their voices to a rousing Auld Lang Syne.
In Edinburgh, BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood will be presenting from the Royal Mile where party-goers will be encouraged to join in the Old Town Ceilidh in an attempt to break the world record for the biggest Strip The Willow, last set in Edinburgh in 2000.
The show will be streamed live for a worldwide audience online at bbc.co.uk/hogmanay and will also be available via the red button for viewers across the UK.
