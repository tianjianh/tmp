Network Rail 'U-turn' over silent Oxford track

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents have criticised Network Rail for failing to keep a promise to limit noise on a new railway.

Trains between Oxford Parkway and Oxford City stations start running on Monday, but a so-called "silent track" cutting noise and vibrations has not been installed.
Residents said they have been lied to, while Oxford City Council said Network Rail has breached planning conditions.
Network Rail said the track would have had "little benefit".
Michael Drolet, who lives by the line in Wolvercote, said: "It wasn't a promise, it was embedded in the law.
"I feel more than let down. We've been lied to in this whole thing."
Mr Drolet called on the city council to step in, but Alex Hollingsworth, who is in charge of planning at the authority, said it had "limited powers".
He agreed that Network Rail "gave undertakings to residents that it would install silent track… which they've now gone back on".
He also admitted the council was a "long way away" from considering an injunction to stop trains running, but that it could still seek enforcement action.
Several posters have been put up around Wolvercote asking: "Where is Oxford's silent track?"
A Network Rail spokesman said: "[We] pledged to look at whether silent track would help reduce railway noise, however we soon discovered that, if installed, it would make no discernible noise reduction.
"For the £3m cost and with such little benefit, it was clear this was not good value for taxpayers' money so we have instead installed £10m of trackside noise barriers, proven to work, along 2.5 miles of track in that area of Oxford."
Network Rail has made a planning application to lift the silent track conditions, which will be considered by the council in January.
