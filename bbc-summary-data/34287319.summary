Pakistan's military said the 13-year-old girl and 55-year-old man were killed late on Thursday in the Nakyal sector, near the Line of Control.
It said Pakistani troops returned fire and shelling was continuing. There has been no official comment from India.
Pakistan and India have overlapping territorial claims in Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region.
In recent years violence has abated from its peak in the 1990s, but the causes of the insurgency are still far from resolved.
A ceasefire agreed in 2003 remains in place, but the nuclear-armed neighbours often accuse each other of violating it.
In 2014 there was an escalation in hostilities along the disputed border , with some of the worst violence in a decade. Both sides accuse each other of initiating the clashes.
