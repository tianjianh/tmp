Florian Lupu dragged the woman, who was with two friends, across a road before the "sickening" attack, police said.
Lupu fled when her friends shouted at him. He was arrested by officers three months later.
The 29-year-old, of Headingley Road, Handsworth admitted raping the woman in Birmingham last July and was jailed for five years and four months.
The friends, who had been out celebrating on Broad Street, took a short cut through a building site near Paradise Circus but could not get out the other end.

Lupu, who was nearby, lifted a fence so they could get out and then began walking with them.
The Romanian national put his arm around one woman who shrugged it off and walked ahead.
He then did the same to the 21-year-old, "steering" her away from her friends, police said.
When they realised a few minutes later that she had disappeared, her friends retraced their steps and found Lupu raping her in a doorway of an office block.
The attack was captured on CCTV, police added.
Lupu was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court where he was also ordered to sign the sex offenders' register for life.
Investigating officer Det Con Gavin McGrath said: "I would like to commend the woman in this case for her courage and I hope today's sentence will help her to move on with her life knowing the person responsible is behind bars."
