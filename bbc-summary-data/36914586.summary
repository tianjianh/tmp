A baby has been hit by an egg that was dropped from a bridge in a Fife park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The seven-month-old girl was part of a group of adults and small children in pushchairs and prams when the egg was thrown at about 14:30 on Wednesday in Pittencrief Park, Dunfermline.
Police Scotland said the infant was not injured.
Sgt Kenny Bow, of Police Scotland, said: "The fact the child was unhurt during this incident is more down to luck than judgement."
He added: "While we believe that this has been done as a prank rather than out of any malice, it is extremely dangerous to drop any item from height and the consequences could have been worse for those walking below.
"We would like to remind the public, in particular, children of the risks and consequences of such reckless behaviour.
"With it being the school holidays the Glen was extremely busy and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen the culprits, or who has any information to come forward."
