Wigan secured their place in the Super League play-offs with a comfortable win over Catalans Dragons at The Den.

Ben Flower and Matty Bowen crossed for the hosts in the first period, with Krisnan Inu going over for Catalans.
Scott Dureau levelled the scores just after the break but Bowen finished off a neat move to put Wigan back in front.
Oliver Gildart added another before Jordan Sigismeau got Catalans back in it but tries from Josh Charnley, Larne Patrick and Dom Manfredi sealed it.
Wigan are now seven points clear of fifth-placed Castleford with three matches remaining, while Catalans' slim hopes of reaching the top four were ended by St Helens' win at Leeds on Friday.
The Warriors had elected to move their home game against the French side to London in order to build their fan base in the city.
The vast majority of the 8, 101 fans in the ground will have been delighted with the professional performance put in by the Warriors, who opened the scoring in the 15th minute as Flower powered through the visiting defence, with Bowen adding the extras with the first of his seven successful kicks.
Catalans levelled soon afterwards when Inu scored in the far-left corner, but Wigan led 12-6 four minutes later as George Williams broke the defensive line, before finding Bowen, who crashed through.
A superb offload from Zeb Taia fed Escare, who found Dureau and the scrum-half touched down and added the extras just after the break.
Wigan then scored five tries in 25 minutes to pull clear.
Bowen scored after his inside run was perfectly found by Joel Tomkins, before the lead doubled to 12 points as a grubber kick from Williams fell kindly for Gildart.
Catalans made it 24-16 as Sigismeau scored in the corner before Charnley squeezed over, Patrick scored from a Gildart kick in the corner and Manfredi went in after Matty Smith found him with a clever inside pass.
