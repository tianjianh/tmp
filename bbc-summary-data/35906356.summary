[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen swept aside hapless Hamilton Academical to cut Celtic's advantage at the top of the Premiership back to four points.

The defending champions make up their game in hand at Dundee on Tuesday but Derek McInnes's side proved they are not going to give up the chase.
Simon Church's header put the Dons in front, and Niall McGinn exploited a terrible defensive error for a second.
Kenny McLean then turned in his eighth goal of the season as Accies toiled.
The result looked beyond their redemption as soon as they fell two behind as Aberdeen started with a pace, skill, determination and aggression that simply overwhelmed the visitors.
McLean showed why he earned a first Scotland cap against Czech Republic last month by curling a shot-cum-cross against the outside of Michael McGovern's right-hand post.

The Dons midfielder also forced the Northern Ireland international into an impressive save after bursting clear of two defenders to get in an angled shot.
Aberdeen were already ahead by then, though, as some dazzling play from Jonny Hayes, who was brimming with confidence after earning his first Republic of Ireland caps during the international break.
The winger pinched possession off a dithering Antons Kurakins then sent over a delicious cross that invited the finish Church gave it with a powerful six-yard header.
Hamilton gifted the home side their second as Ziggy Gordon and McGovern left the clearing duties to each other and McGinn nipped in to score.
At that stage, it looked as if Accies would be in for a repeat of the 8-1 hammering they took at Celtic Park earlier this year as Aberdeen's movement and crisp link-up play pulled them apart.
Luckily they had McGovern to save them on a number of occasions while Scott Brown at the other end was largely unemployed despite one real let-off in 20 minutes when Dougie Imrie broke free.
His lung-bursting run down the left ended with a wicked back-post cross that Oumar Diaby was only inches away from converting as he slid in trying desperately to make contact.
It was rare respite, though, as a superb move down Aberdeen's left saw Hayes send Graeme Shinnie away on the overlap and the full-back's cross was swept in by McLean.
Hamilton did work harder to get closer to their opponents in the second half and Diaby's looping header forced Brown into a save.
However, it took more impressive McGovern saves and some narrow escapes to keep the scoreline down and Accies have a lot of work to do to maintain their Premiership status, with Martin Canning's side remaining just four points clear of the relegation zone.
Shay Logan, McGinn and Mark Reynolds all could have added to Aberdeen's lead but McInnes's men had to be content with their three goals.
