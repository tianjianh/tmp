Versatile back Stockdale, 21, has enjoyed a fine season, scoring eight tries in his 14 appearances, which include seven starts.
Prop Kane and centre Lyttle, who are Academy members, have also earned a place on the senior panel.
"They are outstanding talents who have demonstrated their qualities for our team," said director of rugby Les Kiss.
He added: "In addition to having the physical attributes to be top class players, they also possess a positive mental aptitude and a strong understanding of the game.
"Their development has really accelerated under Kieran Campbell and Willie Anderson in the Academy and they have shown great appetite to continue that with the senior squad.
"All three were identified in the school game at a young age and have come through our player development pathway, which is essential for the sustainable future of Ulster Rugby.
"We have significantly increased investment in this area over the past couple of years and we are starting to reap the rewards."
