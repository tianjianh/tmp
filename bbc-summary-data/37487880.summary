Ryder Cup 2016: Pick your all-time Europe and US teams

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ever wanted to be a Ryder Cup captain? This is your chance.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Europe skipper Darren Clarke and United States counterpart Davis Love only had to deliberate over a handful of names, with the bulk of their teams decided by a ranking system.
However, you have complete control.
It is simple. We have compiled a shortlist of 25 European and 25 US Ryder Cup stars based on their number of appearances, points claimed for their team and their win percentage.
You have to pick 12 to create your dream European and US teams.
Is Seve a certainty for Team Europe? Would a pumped-up Poulter sneak in? And would your US side feature all-time greats Palmer, Woods and Nicklaus?
You have until 16:00 BST on Friday to make your selections and then we will collate the information and reveal which 24 players were the most popular picks.
Then on Saturday, with the 41st Ryder Cup in full swing at Hazeltine, you will have the chance to create a combined 'Team of Legends' from both sides - and then argue all day about the merits of your choices.
Let's get started....
