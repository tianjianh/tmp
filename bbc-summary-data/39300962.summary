The attacks happened just before 01:00 GMT on Friday.
One detonated at Woodland Court and another in nearby Ballaghmore Court. Damage was caused to the properties but no-one was injured.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the bombs to contact them.
The good name of Bushmills had been tarnished by those behind the attacks, said DUP MLA Mervyn Storey.
Those responsible believed they could act as "judge, jury and executioner", he added.
"Had anybody been in close proximity to the window at one of the properties, then someone would have been seriously injured," he said.
"It was a reckless action by those who believe that they have the right to carry out this form of justice and it's something that has to be brought to an end.
"These attacks are a cancer on our society, they instil fear in the community."
Norman Hillis, a UUP (Ulster Unionist Party) councillor for the area, also condemned those behind the attacks, expressing anger at people who wanted "to drag us into the past".
