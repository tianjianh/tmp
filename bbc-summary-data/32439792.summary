The manifesto will also pledge to end zero-hours contracts and included a list of what it described as "100% anti-austerity" measures.
TUSC is fielding 10 candidates in Scotland for the general election.
The manifesto launch in Glasgow came as campaigning across the country continued ahead of 7 May.
TUSC is backed by the RMT trade union, socialist organisations, leading trade unionists and anti-cuts campaigners.
TUSC spokesman Brian Smith said: "We utterly reject the savage austerity plans of the establishment parties.
"Neither do the austerity-lite promises from the SNP who, despite their words, have implemented billions in Tory cuts in Scotland since 2010, offer a real and consistent alternative."
With 135 candidates throughout the UK, TUSC said it was the sixth-largest group contesting the general election.
Mr Smith added: "Scottish TUSC is offering total opposition to all austerity, public ownership not privatisation, a living minimum wage now of £10 an hour and the abolition of all anti-union laws."
