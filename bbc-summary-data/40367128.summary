The Ministry of Defence is investing £135m in new facilities in preparation for the arrival of the F-35B Lightning II aircraft next year.
The money will pay for a new hangar to house 12 of the jets and and provide vertical landing pads.
Two existing runways and taxiways will be resurfaced.
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: "This contract will ensure that RAF Marham has the facilities to match this world-class aircraft when it arrives next year.
"Throughout the F-35 programme, British firms have won major contracts creating thousands of jobs.
"The contract to improve the runways and taxiways as well as installing new landing pads will bring local jobs to Marham."
Last year it was announced the government was investing £167m in centres for aircraft training and maintenance at RAF Marham.
Due to open in 2018, three new buildings on the site will provide training facilities for pilots and ground crews.
