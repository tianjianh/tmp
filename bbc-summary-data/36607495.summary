The 23-year-old scored made 46 Super League appearances for the Dragons, scoring 10 tries, before returning to Australia this season.
Despite signing a two-year contract with the Panthers, Garcia failed to break into the first team.
"I had a great year down under but I couldn't refuse the contract offered by the Dragons," he told the club website.
"The Dragons has a great season so far and I hope I can bring my contribution to its success."
Catalans head coach Laurent Frayssinous added: "Ben is a talented young player and his qualities and his versatility will help the team to move forward.
"He always kept the club in his heart and, after his experience in Australia, he is really motivated to add his contribution."
