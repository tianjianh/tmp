Three cars were parked across the road, with protesters chaining themselves to one of the vehicles at about 08:30 GMT.
The tunnel, which accesses Terminals 2 and 3, was shut for more than two hours while the M4 spur road was also temporarily closed.
Five people have been arrested on suspicion of obstructing a highway, the Metropolitan Police said.
One of the protesters who was chained to the vehicle was taken to hospital as a precaution.

The disruption caused widespread delays, as traffic was diverted to the outbound tunnel at the airport.
A spokesman for the Rising Up campaign group said it was protesting against the impact a proposed third runway could have on climate change and the local area.
Heathrow Airport said: "Heathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues together with the smooth running of the operation is paramount."
Campaign group Back Heathrow said the actions of the protesters were "selfish, short-sighted and counter-productive".
