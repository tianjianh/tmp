[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest was opened into the death of a woman who died after getting into difficulty in the sea off the coast of Jersey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joy Godfray, 31, was washed out to sea during a high tide and strong winds off Green Island on Saturday.
Fire crews rescued her from the sea, but she later died in hospital.
Deputy Viscount Advocate Mark Harris adjourned the inquest after releasing Ms Godfray's body to her family for burial.
She was one of six people who died in the British Isles last weekend as weather and high tides made for treacherous conditions along coastlines.
