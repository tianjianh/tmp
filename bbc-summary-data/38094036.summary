[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reigning champion Neil Robertson suffered a shock defeat in the first round of the UK Championship, losing 6-3 to amateur veteran Peter Lines.

Englishman Lines, 46, won a marathon first frame against the Australian and a break of 58 put him 2-0 ahead.
Robertson scored three half centuries as he fought back to trail 4-3, but Lines held his nerve to progress.
He was not going to be scared. He played a brilliant match
Lines said the win over the world number seven was the "most pleasing of his career."
Leeds star Lines, a UK quarter-finalist in 2009, said: "It was a daunting task, but I just thought I wanted to relax and at least give a good account of myself.
"In my heart I wasn't expecting to win but I played well and am really pleased with how I held myself together because Neil is a fantastic player."
Lines, who joins his 21-year-old son Oliver in the last 64, only dropped off the tour at the end of last season and Robertson said his opponent's experience shone through in his "incredible safety play".
"He didn't make a whole load of big breaks but he didn't have to because his safety was that good," said Robertson, the 2013 and 2015 UK champion.
"It was a tough match. He is still a great player and he showed that. He was not going to be scared. He played a brilliant match."

Elsewhere on the final day of the first round, reigning world champion Mark Selby, who took the UK title in 2012, easily beat fellow Englishman Andy Hicks 6-1.
Another ex-world champion, Stuart Bingham, thrashed Adam Stefanow 6-0.
Bingham won a scrappy opening frame but was in fine form thereafter, scoring three half centuries and two tons against his Polish opponent.
"I scored heavily and didn't miss much," said Bingham, 40. "I took my chances and if I keep playing like that I have every chance here."
World number 16 Mark Williams said he "struggled from start to finish" despite beating Jason Weston 6-1 to reach round two at the York Barbican.
Williams, the champion in 1999 and 2002, lost frame two but was always in control against his English opponent.
The Welshman, who said he was struggling with a neck problem, added: "I had a couple of good breaks but overall it was poor."
Stephen Maguire, the champion in 2004, is also through after beating China's Cao Yupeng 6-1, while fellow Scot Alan McManus recovered from 5-0 down to beat Michael Wild 6-5.
Ali Carter made four half-century and two century breaks in a 6-1 win over fellow Englishman Christopher Keogan.
But there was no fairytale win for Jamie Curtis-Barrett, who fought back from 4-0 down to 4-3 against Joe Perry, before losing 6-3.
