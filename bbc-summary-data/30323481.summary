Eoin O'Connor and Anthony Keegan: Man arrested over murders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been arrested in connection with the murders of Eoin O'Connor and Anthony Keegan in the Republic of Ireland earlier this year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr O'Connor, 32, and Mr Keegan, 33, from Coolock, Dublin, were found dead on 26 May on an island on Lough Sheelin, County Meath.
The pair were last seen in County Cavan on 22 April.
They had told their families they were going to a meeting. The latest arrest is the third in the investigation.
At the time of the men's disappearance, the police suspected they had gone to Cavan to settle a drugs debt to a criminal gang.
A car belonging to one of the men was discovered near a lake in County Westmeath, three days after they were last seen.
They were discovered on the island following searches by police. Their bodies appeared to have been tied up and placed under a tarpaulin that was covered with vegetation.
