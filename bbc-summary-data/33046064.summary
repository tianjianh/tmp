[SN]TITLE[SN]
In quotes: What PM said on ministers voting in EU poll

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
David Cameron has denied saying government ministers will be forced to back him in the EU referendum or quit their jobs. Here is what he said on ministers' voting rights.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ANDREW MARR
Would you give cabinet ministers and other Conservatives who want to campaign for an out, the freedom to do so in such a referendum?
DAVID CAMERON
Well, there are Conservative Members of Parliament who want to leave the European Union...
ANDREW MARR
Yes, there are.
DAVID CAMERON
... come what may, but if you're part of the government, then clearly you're part of the team that is aiming for the renegotiation...
ANDREW MARR
(over) So you're not going to do a free vote...
DAVID CAMERON
... referendum...
ANDREW MARR(over)... as Labour did in, in the 70s.
DAVID CAMERON
No, I've set out that very clearly in the past.
Full transcript of the interview here.
QUESTION
Do you think the referendum should be held as a stand-alone, as the Electoral Commission do? Is it so important that it - you know, it needn't be mixed up with other election...?
PRIME MINISTER
My view is that we should hold the referendum when we've completed the negotiation. On whether it should be with other elections or not, I take a very open-minded view. Let's do it when the negotiation's completed, but - and take it from there.
QUESTION
You don't think it's so important that it should be left on its own?
PRIME MINISTER
It is very important, but I mean - personally, I think the British public are quite capable of going to a polling booth and making two important decisions rather than just one, and I think, you know, the evidence has shown that. But what will determine the timing of the referendum is not the timing of other elections: what will determine the timing is the outcome of the negotiation, but with that deadline at the end of 2017.
QUESTION
Can I just check, on the EU referendum, have you absolutely closed your mind to allowing ministers a free vote? That's a no-no [inaudible]?
PRIME MINISTER
I've been very clear, which is I've said that if you want to be part of the government, you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation to have a referendum, and that will lead to a successful outcome.
QUESTION
So anyone in government who opposes that will have to resign?
PRIME MINISTER
Everyone in government has signed up to the programme set out in the Conservative manifesto. Thank you. See you all later. Enjoy the mountain.
"It is clear to me that what I said yesterday was misinterpreted. I was clearly referring to the process of renegotiation.
"But the point is this. I have always said what I want is an outcome for Britain that keeps us in a reformed EU. But I have also said we don't know the outcome of these negotiations, which is why I have always said I rule nothing out.
"Therefore it would be wrong to answer hypothetical questions. I know that can be frustrating. I know you want to jump to the end of the process and have all the questions answered now about the end of that process.
"That is not going to be possible. You are going to have to take this stage by stage, step by step and you will get the answers."
Restating his position once again, he told journalists: "What I said is if you want to be part of the government you have to take the view that we are engaged in an exercise of renegotiation to have a referendum that will lead to a successful outcome.
"That is what I said. I feel that there was a misinterpretation which is why I woke up and read the newspapers and thought 'I will repeat what I said and make that very clear'."
Chancellor George Osborne, 29 September 2014: "People will know what the Conservative Party's policy is. But ultimately it will be a free vote for backbench members of the Conservative Party - it's a referendum, of course.
"But people should be in no doubt that the Conservative government will put forward its proposal at the referendum, the reform that we will have achieved, the renegotiation that we will have achieved, the successful outcome of that renegotiation at the election."
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, on Andrew Marr on 7 June 2015: "Government ministers will be free to support the government line."
