There was little between the teams in a tense and nervy encounter, until centre-half McAuley turned Gareth Bale's cross into his own net.
But who stood out and who struggled to make an impact in the game?
Made an excellent early stop from Stuart Dallas and also denied Jamie Ward. Collected corners confidently but had little else to do.
Just about got the better of his battle with Dallas for control of Wales' right flank. Got forward well but did not make his crosses count.
Joined attacks like Gunter on the opposite flank and it was his cross that led to Ramsey's offside goal, but otherwise some poor touches in the Northern Ireland half meant Wales lost momentum. Worked hard defensively, though.
Coped well with Kyle Lafferty's physical and aerial threat for the most part and used the ball well, too.
Shaded Davies as the most solid Welsh defender. Won his headers when it mattered and seemed to enjoy his tussles with Lafferty.
Rattled at times in the first half by Northern Ireland's pressing, but more comfortable after the break.
Often crowded out early on and struggled to find his rhythm or his passing radar in the first half. Improved after the break but did not set the Welsh tempo as he did against Russia.
Had to drop deep to get on the ball early on but saw more of it as the game went on and showed flashes of his quality in a mostly mediocre match.
Worked hard but struggled to impose himself in a packed midfield, where Wales were unable to exert control.
Forced wide when he was able to run with the ball and saw his only free-kick saved by McGovern, but delivered a rare moment of quality when it mattered with his driven cross that McAuley turned into his own net.
Short of service but his header for Ramsey to score a goal that was offside might have crept in on its own. Should have done better when he headed Ramsey's cross wide.
More mobile than Vokes and again caused Northern Ireland problems just by his work-rate, rather than any real cutting edge.
Used the ball well when he came on. Was not always successful when he ran at the Northern Ireland defence but willing to try something different.
Called on to make his first save from Gareth Bale's free-kick early in the second half. Not as busy as he was against Germany, but a confident performance
Calm and effective display in his 103rd - and possibly last - appearance for Northern Ireland. The 36-year-old repaid O'Neill's faith.
The outstanding performer in the Northern Ireland defence. Dealt well with Bale early on and made timely challenges and interceptions throughout.
Marshalled the back four well but was the unlucky man who turned in Bale's delivery for the decisive own goal. Cruel on the 36-year-old Northern Ireland stalwart.
Solid, unfussy display from the Watford centre-back. Played his part in keeping things tight at the back for Michael O'Neill's men.
Did a capable job in his deep midfield role. Worked hard and never gave up as Northern Ireland looked for a late equaliser.
The leader and class act in the Northern Ireland team. The one player who seemed to have time on the ball. Booked for fouling Bale in the second half.
Gave away possession a couple of times and was guilty of a couple of poorly-delivered corners in the second half. Still, he gave his all and had a good tournament.
Forced an early save with a well-hit shot and earned a yellow card for a late challenge on Bale towards the end of the first half.
Had a decent crack at goal in the first half, which keeper Wayne Hennessey had to tip over the bar. An energetic, hard-running performance.
Worked tirelessly and caused problems for the Wales defence. Desperately wanted to score at the tournament but did not get a clear chance today.
Sent on for Ward in the 69th minute in an attempt to pose more threat. Gave it his all but with no end result.
On for Oliver Norwood in the 79th minute - but no fairytale late goal this time for the Aberdeen midfielder.
Replaced defender McAuley for the last few minutes and did not have much time to make an impact.
