Tottenham Hotspur says it has struck a private deal to buy disputed land for a proposed Â£400m football stadium.

A statement on the club's website said an agreement had been reached to buy Archway Sheet Metal Works' property, in Paxton Road, Tottenham.
The Premier League club has planning permission for a 56,000-seater stadium at White Hart Lane.
It said it would take possession of the land later this year to give the firm time to relocate.
In November, a fire gutted the Archway premises, located close to White Hart Lane. The cause of the blaze is not known, but police were treating it as suspicious.
A High Court ruling in February upheld the Haringey Council compulsory purchase order of the site and the firm decided earlier this month not to appeal against the decision.
The statement posted on the club's website on Tuesday read: "Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, Archway Sheet Metal Works Ltd and the Josif Family (Archway) are delighted to announce that a private agreement has been reached for the purchase of Archway's property on Paxton Road by the Club.
"In order to allow Archway to relocate its business appropriately, the Club will not take possession of the land until later this year."
