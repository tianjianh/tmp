A head teacher has used her weekly letter to tell off parents who allow their children to arrive at school in a "dirty and unkempt" state.

Judith Barrett, principal of St Michael's Academy in Yeovil, said "an increasing number of children" come to school "in a pretty shocking state".
The letter goes on to say some pupils "obviously haven't had a shower in readiness for Monday morning".
A spokesperson for the school said it would not comment on the letter.
The academy has about 220 pupils aged seven to 11.
The principal's letter says many children are getting themselves up in the morning and into school "as their parents are still in bed".
"In a country where there is plentiful running water and washing machines, and shops like Tesco offering entire school uniforms for Â£10, it is a pretty poor indictment of the parenting skills of some of our families."
The letter ends by warning parents the school will phone them at home to collect their children if they are not wearing the correct uniform including black shoes.
