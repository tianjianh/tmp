Man in court over Taj Madina Mosque attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been accused of smashing glass in a Dundee mosque and struggling with members of the congregation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Skene, from Dundee, is alleged to have burst into Taj Madina Mosque in Victoria Road on Friday afternoon.
The 38-year-old is said to have "conducted himself in a disorderly manner" by acting aggressively, shouting and swearing.
The case was continued for further examination and Mr Skene was remanded in custody.
Prosecutors allege that Mr Skene repeatedly punched and smashed the glass of framed prayers on the walls during the incident.
He made no plea or declaration during the brief private hearing through his solicitor Ross Donnelly.
He is expected to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court again next week.
