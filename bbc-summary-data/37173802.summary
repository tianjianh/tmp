The 2006 Martin Scorsese film, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is being made into an hour-long TV drama by Amazon, the Hollywood Reporter said.
It will be based on Scorsese's movie as well as the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs, on which it was in turn based.
The Departed won a total of four Oscars, including best director for Scorsese - his first Academy Award.
The TV show will be set in modern-day Chicago and tell the story of a young police officer who goes undercover to infiltrate a Latino gang.
It is said to be Warner Bros TV's first co-production with Amazon and the pilot will be written by Jason Richman, who will also be an executive producer on the show.
Scorsese's film starred DiCaprio as Billy Costigan, an undercover cop who becomes involved in a Boston crime gang run by Jeff Costello, played by Jack Nicholson.
The film also starred Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, who won a best supporting actor nomination for his performance as a foul-mouthed police officer.
As well as best director, it won Oscars for best picture, best adapted screenplay and best editing.
Other films currently being made into television dramas include The Lost Boys, Lethal Weapon and Taken.
