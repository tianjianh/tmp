[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police inquiry into alleged sexual abuse at a children's nursery in Wiltshire has been dropped after a five-month investigation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Little Angels Nursery in Calne closed down in September, a month after a man and a woman were arrested and bailed by detectives.
The pair have now been released without charge and the investigation has concluded, police said.
The nursery opened in 2009 and had been previously rated as good by Ofsted.
A spokesman for the Wiltshire force said: "Whilst we appreciate this has caused a considerable amount of concern in the local community, due to the nature and scope of the investigation, it was imperative given the information passed to us that our enquiries were comprehensive and thorough."
The owner of the nursery Rachel Cartmell, who was not arrested, had previously said she and her staff were fully co-operating with police.
Before its closure the nursery looked after 78 children and its nine staff members had all been vetted appropriately according to Ofsted.
