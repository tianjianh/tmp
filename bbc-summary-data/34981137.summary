Photographer Kevin Wells gave the hip-hop legends a lift when they were left stranded on Saturday, shortly before being due onstage.
He previously said an impromptu sing-along of Queen's 1975 hit had been a highlight of the journey.
Band frontman Chuck D said it was "a pleasure".

The rapper told 5 Live he had suggested Mr Wells' passengers, including bandmate Flavor Flav, indulge in a spot of head banging during the journey.
Once inside, Chuck D said he kicked off an in-car rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody, similar to that in 1992 comedy Wayne's World, although he himself did not sing.
"I did the riff," he said.
"You don't sing at that part, that's the part where you slam your head."
The group had been signing autographs at a record store before their gig in Sheffield, but a taxi mix-up left them without transport.
Chuck D said the group had struggled to get a lift until Mr Wells stepped in.
"We walked a couple of blocks, got into his car and had a great time," he said.
Chuck D said Mr Wells had been offered a chance to appear onstage, but prior commitments meant he had to decline.
"We were going to have him onstage for the last song, Harder Than You Think.
"Getting to the gig was harder than you thought."

The band were "very grateful" to Mr Wells, he said.
"It was a pleasure that we happened to interact in our lives at that particular moment and it worked out for all of us."
