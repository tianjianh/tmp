[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
People living in the South Wales Police area will see a 5% increase in the amount they pay for policing - the highest rise of all four Welsh forces.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police and Crime Commissioner  Alun Michael said the money - an extra 11 to 15p per week for most households - would safeguard policing levels.
He added South Wales Police remained the lowest cost to tax payers of the Welsh forces.
The increase for the next financial year will raise an extra £5m.
Mr Michael said it would help the force as it faced £9m of cuts this year and £27m over the next four years.
It comes as tax payers in Dyfed-Powys will see a 5% drop in their police bill - a saving of £10 a year for the average band D household.
However North Wales Police's bill is set to go up by 3.44% and Gwent's will rise by 3.99%.
