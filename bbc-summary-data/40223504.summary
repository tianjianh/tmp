The plans include constructing a 4,000sq m freezer and 13,000sq m chiller in order to cater for growing product ranges.
The company said the project would lead to up to 200 jobs, including construction posts.
Aldi has yet to say when work will start on the new facilities.
In a statement, Aldi said the move was part of wider plans to boost its investment in Scotland.
They include a commitment to increase its range of Scottish products from 350 to more than 400 in the next two years.
The retailer's Scottish headquarters recently underwent a multi-million pound extension to support its expansion plans and "local sourcing footprint."
The latest investment plans were announced at Aldi's supplier conference in Glasgow.
Giles Hurley, group managing director of Aldi UK and Ireland, said: "Aldi has led the way with local sourcing and now has a strong reputation for having the best quality Scottish products on shelves.
"Over the coming years, as we increase our range of Scottish products, we expect to grow our market share considerably and attract even more shoppers into stores."
