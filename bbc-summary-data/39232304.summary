Senegalese Walliou Ndoye gave the hosts a ninth-minute lead and Karim Aouadhi converted two penalties before half-time.
Further goals from Alaa Marzouki and Ndoye served notice that Sfaxien are aiming to emulate the title-winning teams of 2007, 2008 and 2013.
Sfaxien are now guided by Argentina 1986 World Cup winner Nestor Clausen (pictured) - who joined the club last November after spells with clubs in his homeland, Bolivia, Switzerland, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Ecuador.
The Tunisian club's last appearance in this tournament was a massive disappointment as they failed to win any of six 2015 group games and lost four.
