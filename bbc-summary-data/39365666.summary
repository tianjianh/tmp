[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland is to get a state-of-the-art indoor tennis centre to satisfy demand for year round access to a sport in which the nation is now a world leader.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new four-court arena is to be built in St Andrews in Fife with the aim of encouraging more people to play tennis at all levels.
It will be built at St Andrews University's sports centre at St Leonard's Road.
Fife Schools will have regular access to the new centre on school days.
Student tennis players will be encouraged to work with youngsters to develop coaching and volunteering experience.
The Â£3m centre is being funded by St Andrews University, Sportscotland, Tennis Scotland, the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), a private donor and the St Andrews alumni community.
St Andrews is investing over Â£14m in its sports facilities.
Work on the new centre will begin this week and is due to be complete in September.
Mike Aitken, St Andrews director of tennis, said: "The building of a four-court indoor centre is hugely exciting for the whole tennis community.
"It will be a fantastic venue offering a full coaching and competitive programme as well as pay and play for members of the community. We will cater for students, staff, schools, local clubs and disability groups by offering sessions for all levels.
"We will also play our part in the district, Tennis Scotland and LTA development plans with competition, player development and coach education.
"We hope to run a programme that will get more people playing more tennis at whatever level and provide a great experience for those using the facility."
