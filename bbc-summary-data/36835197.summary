[SN]TITLE[SN]
Same-sex Manx marriages can go ahead after Royal Assent

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Same-sex marriages can go ahead in the Isle of Man following the granting of Royal Assent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Marriage and Civil Partnership Act is based on the same legal framework introduced in England two years ago.
It enables same-sex couples to marry in a civil ceremony or, subject to agreement, in a religious celebration.
Manx civil partnerships have been allowed since 2011 - the new legislation comes into effect on Friday.
Chief Minister Allan Bell described the move - which was backed by Tynwald in April - as an "historic moment" for the island.
"Recognition of marriage for same-sex couples shows just how far the island has travelled over the past 30 years," he said.
Homosexuality was only decriminalised on the Isle of Man in 1992 - a quarter of a century later than in England and Wales.
It is thought the island's first same-sex marriage is due to take place at the end of July.
