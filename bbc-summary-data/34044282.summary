MP criticises United Utilities for water bug delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An MP has criticised United Utilities for delays in informing customers when their supply will be safe to drink after cryptosporidium was found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
South Ribble MP Seema Kennedy said there should be clarity about the restoration of the water supply.
Almost 300,000 households have been boiling their water since 6 August.
The company previously said it would have an idea of when restrictions could be lifted once UV light treated the water.
United Utilities began installing eight rigs to treat the water with UV light last week. The treatment instantly kills the bug.
Levels of cryptosporidium are "very low" but the company urged people to continue boiling water as a result of the microbial parasite - which causes diarrhoea and abdominal cramps.
Affected areas include Blackpool, Chorley, Fylde, Preston, South Ribble, Wyre and the Mellor area of Blackburn.
The warning was originally issued after traces of the bug were found at the Franklaw treatment works near Preston.
Ms Kennedy said: "This situation has now been going on for 18 days and I keep asking United Utilities when is an end date in sight because people need to plan."
"At the beginning we had this notice and we thought it would be a matter of a couple of days or a week," she said.
"I have made two telephone calls today to United Utilities to have further clarification about when this will be ended."
She said the Drinking Water Inspectorate had informed her the water company had been told "to get on with providing a plan and managing the public's expectations."
The BBC has contacted United Utilities for a response. The Drinking Water Inspectorate was not available for comment.
