New Doctor Who star Peter Capaldi has admitted he is still finding his feet when it comes to playing the Time Lord.

"I don't know if it's quite fallen into place yet," the 56-year-old told the Radio Times. "I think it's a mistake to get it to click, to get into a groove.
"I've tried to avoid finding a way to do it and then just repeating that," the former Thick of It actor continued.
The latest series of the popular sci-fi show begins on Saturday with an 80-minute episode set in Victorian London.
It will be the first full adventure for Capaldi's Doctor following his brief introduction as Matt Smith's successor at the end of last year's Christmas Day special.
"I'm trying all the time to see what works and what doesn't work," said the Scottish actor, who made a previous appearance in Doctor Who in 2008.
"I'm trying to bring back some of the Doctor's mystery and strangeness, which is hard to do given that the show is 50 years old.
"I think I'm a more grown-up Doctor, but he's still mirthful," continued Capaldi, who said his time traveller would be "serious when he needs to be".
His comments follow a previously aired interview with the BBC in which he said his Doctor would be "less user-friendly" and "a little darker" than previous incarnations.
Capaldi's latest interview also sees him speak generally on the advice he has received from Smith and David Tennant - another Scot to have played the Doctor in recent years.
"You're an actor and sometimes have to compare notes to see how the others might have felt about the things I am going through or am being asked to do," he is quoted as saying.
"It's good to be able to chat to people who have been in the same situation [and] have something to do with people who you have seen triumph in that situation."
In the run-up to this weekend's series launch, it has been revealed that Capaldi will be joined by his Thick of It co-star Chris Addison later in the run.
The comedian, who played Oliver Reeder to Capaldi's Malcolm Tucker in the political satire, said it was "a 35-year dream come true" to have a role in the new series' two-part finale.
