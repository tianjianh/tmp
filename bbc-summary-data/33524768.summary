[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hundreds of people in East Yorkshire are being targeted by phone scammers posing as police officers following a rise in so called 'vishing' fraud.

Humberside Police said more than £250,000 has been stolen from victims in the last year.
They said up to 25 people a day - more than 750 people a month - are receiving calls from bogus officials.
The force has urged people to be aware of the scam.
"Vishing" - or voice phishing - occurs when fraudsters, often posing as police officer, phone their target and tell them they have been the victim of fraud.
The victim is then duped into either handing over their card and personal details, often to a second fraudster posing as a bank employee, or into passing cash to a courier in order to protect it.

Det Sgt Mike Wood, of Humberside Police, said: "Over the last four months we've had a vast influx.
"I would estimate that probably around £250,000 has been lost. We've had some people who have lost quite large amounts but a more regular amount is about £5,000."
Pat Bottomley, who lost £8,000 said: "I can't give anything to charities anymore, which used to be one of my big pleasures, or to my children and grand children. It leaves you personally devastated."
