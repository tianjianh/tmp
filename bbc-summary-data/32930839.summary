A sinkhole caused by the collapse of a tunnel has the "volume of two London double-decker buses", a council said.

The hole, which opened up in Hogg Lane, Grays, on Wednesday, is now estimated to be 2m (6ft 6in) wide and at least 15m (50ft) deep, Thurrock Council said.
Experts said they believed the collapse of a 100-year-old tunnel below the road had caused the sinkhole to appear, but investigations were continuing.
A lorry stranded over the sinkhole is expected to be moved later on.
A Thurrock Council spokesman said the vehicle would be removed once contractors, police and its owner agreed it could be done safely.
The local authority was "hopeful the sinkhole can be secured so foot traffic can pass by in the next few days," the spokesman added.
