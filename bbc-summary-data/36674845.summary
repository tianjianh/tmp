The 24-year-old has 55 goals in 93 La Liga games since joining from Santos for a reported fee of £48.6m in 2013.
Manchester United and Paris St-Germain were linked with the Brazil forward, whose current deal ends in 2018.
Barca president Josep Bartomeu said: "In the next few days we will finalise an extension." Neymar added: "Very happy to continue living this dream!"
Neymar has also scored 46 goals in 70 appearances for his country.
While at the Spanish club, he has secured two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey trophies and the 2014-15 Champions League.
Barcelona were forced to pay a £4.3m fine in June because of mistakes in Neymar's transfer from Santos in 2013.
