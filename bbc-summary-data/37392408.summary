[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Joao Teixeira scored his first two goals for Wolves as Walter Zenga's side beat Brentford at Molineux.

The winger, on loan from Benfica, opened the scoring just after the break with a shot which squeezed under visiting goalkeeper Daniel Bentley.
He added a fortunate second, as his cross from a free-kick on the left bounced past everyone and in.
Sullay Kaikai pulled a goal back for Brentford, before Ivan Cavaleiro scored a stoppage-time third for Wolves.
Substitute Cavaleiro's tap-in from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's cross came after the visitors had dominated the final 20 minutes, with Lasse Vibe and John Egan both missing good opportunities to equalise.
Wolves had drawn six of their previous nine home Championship games and struggled to create chances in a dour first half, with Teixeira's claims for a penalty after a strong challenge from Maxime Colin the only highlight.
However, it was the 22-year-old's fellow Portuguese midfielder Helder Costa who made Wolves' opener with a superb run, although former Southend keeper Bentley arguably should have done better to keep the impressive Teixeira's low effort out.
Palace loanee Kaikai's powerful finish from a tight angle made for a nervy finish for the home fans before record signing Cavaleiro made sure of all three points with his first goal for Wolves.
Wolves manager Walter Zenga:
"We have to continue in this way and not forget where we have come from and where we want to arrive.
"It is a long season and we don't want to forget that if everyone pulls together we can arrive where we want to be.
"I don't want to stay in the middle of the ranking (the league). I don't want to read the ranking until December and then we will talk. At the moment I don't know where we are now. Honest."
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"We gave them cheap goals. Josh (McEachran) should probably have played it wide, ran into trouble and then we didn't have the balance right behind and they broke and scored.
"We've got to be better to prevent that but the second goal should have been our free-kick anyway, it certainly wasn't a free-kick for them, and they scored from that.
"The reaction to going two goals down was good and I thought Wolves started to panic towards the end. We put them under an awful lot of pressure and had some good chances."
