[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish Championship: St Mirren 0-1 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A howler by goalkeeper Jamie Langfield handed all three points to Dumbarton as St Mirren were left five points adrift at the foot of the Championship table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His poor pass handed Joe Thomson the chance to set up Garry Fleming for the only goal of the game after 63 minutes.
Lewis Morgan impressed in midfield for the home side.
But the 20-year-old was unable to prevent the Sons securing a win that lifts them above Dunfermline Athletic and into eighth place.
With St Mirren good in possession and pressing Dumbarton high up the park early on, Morgan's inch-perfect cross found John Sutton, but the striker shot wide of the post.
Morgan came close to breaking the deadlock himself when he was found 15 yards out by Kyle McAllister, but the 20-year-old's near-post shot was turned behind by Alan Martin in the Dumbarton goal.
The visitors were more organised in the second half, but it was a lack of concentration by Saints' goalkeeper that handed them their breakthrough.
Langfield's pass found Thomson, who showed composure by squaring it to the oncoming Fleming and the striker tucked the ball into the open goal without missing a stride.
St Mirren threw everything at the Dumbarton goal, with Sutton finding the side netting and the underside of the bar.
However, the Sons held out for only their second win of the season.
