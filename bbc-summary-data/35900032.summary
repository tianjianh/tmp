[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the world's most famous locomotives has come face-to-face with its modern-day counterpart.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Flying Scotsman, which recently underwent a Â£4.2m, decade-long refit, faced off against the Virgin Trains powercar of the same name at the National Railway Museum in York.
It was named after the Flying Scotsman service from Edinburgh to London.
The engines came together as part of the launch of the museum's Stunts, Speed and Style event.
The six-week long exhibition features the famous engine alongside three other locomotives which have pulled the Flying Scotsman service - GNR No 1, Henry Oakley and the newly restored King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry.
