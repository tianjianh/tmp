The 40-year-old man was walking near Whistleberry Crescent in Hamilton when he was approached by a man who demanded his phone at about 15:45 on Friday.
Police said that when he refused, the victim was stabbed.
He was taken to Hairmyres hospital, where his condition is described as stable.
Officers said the man responsible for the attack ran off, possibly in the direction of Margaret Road in Hamilton.
He is described as being white, aged between 20-29 and was wearing a red hooded top with a white emblem on the front and dark trousers.
Det Con Grant Robertson said the attack happened as the man walked his dog in a wooded area near the street.
He added: "This was a totally unprovoked, violent attack on a man who was merely out walking his dog in the middle of the afternoon.
"He has been left with a serious injury and it is vital that we catch the suspect as he may harm someone else."
Det Con Roberston appealed for anyone who was near Whistleberry Crescent and who may have seen the suspect to contact local police.
