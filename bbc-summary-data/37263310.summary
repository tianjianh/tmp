[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wolverhampton Wanderers 1-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Will Miller grabbed an injury-time equaliser as Burton denied Wolves a third win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miller turned in Lloyd Dyer's cross in the fourth minute of added time.
Lucas Akins had a first-half penalty saved by Wolves keeper Carl Ikeme after Richard Stearman, in his first game since re-joining from Fulham, handled.
Prince Oniangue had broken the deadlock for Wolves in the second half of a tight match with a half-volley after good work from Jon Dadi Bodvarsson.
The Brewers edged the first half in the first meeting between the sides, with Jamie Ward forcing another good stop from Ikeme.
But Wolves, who are unbeaten in the league at home in 10 matches, came on strong late on with Bodvarsson wasting a free header from 10 yards, and Joe Mason poking wide from close range.
Miller's equaliser was the first time a visiting side had scored from open play at Molineux since February and left Burton 14th in the table, while Wolves dropped to 11th.
Wolves' manager Walter Zenga:
"I'm feeling good because the team played good, especially in the second half.
"We deserved to win the game without a doubt but we have to understand we can't give them one chance like this in the last minute of the game.
"Perhaps in the first half the quality wasn't there as we had hoped but then in my opinion the quality showed, we played some nice football.
"It is true sometimes that too much change can create confusion but if you work it the right way, change means you have a fresh team all the time."
Burton manager Nigel Clough:
"It was a bit frustrating that we had to wait until the 95th minute but it does feel like a win when you get a result so late in the day.
"I thought for long spells of the game that we were the ones who were creating the chances and looked the more likely to take the lead.
"Had we scored the penalty you never know it might have been a different story.
"It was only in the last 20 minutes when Wolves stepped it up a little bit and had chances. Apart from that we were comfortable.
"We are going to have a go this season. We will not sit back. We will try and take the game to teams and I think that has been evident in the first six games."
