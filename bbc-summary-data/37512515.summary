Ceremony to mark opening of NI's newest integrated school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A ceremony is to be held on Friday to mark the creation of the newest integrated school in Northern Ireland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Loughries Primary School, just outside Newtownards in County Down, has 75 pupils.
It became an integrated school on 1 September following approval from former education minister John O'Dowd in 2015.
It is the 65th such school in Northern Ireland.
Originally opened in 1842, it is the oldest surviving school in the Newtownards area.
The decision to transform was taken following a ballot in favour of integration by the parents of its pupils.
Children from Protestant, Catholic and a variety of other backgrounds are taught together in integrated schools.
About 22,000 pupils - 7% of the school population - are educated in them.
The first integrated school, Lagan College in Belfast, opened in 1981 and there are now 45 primary schools and 20 post-primary schools across Northern Ireland.
They educate around 22,000 pupils, approximately 7% of the school population.
Any new integrated school must attract 30% of its pupils from the minority community in the area where the school is situated.
However, the growth of the sector has stalled in recent years.
A review of integrated education, also commissioned by Mr O'Dowd earlier this year, is due for completion imminently.
