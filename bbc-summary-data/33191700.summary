Night-time chimes of town hall clock prompts complaint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The night-time chimes of Llangollen Town Hall's clock should be silenced so people can get a  good night's sleep, a hotelier has said.

Abdul Mahfouz, who runs the Royal Hotel in the Denbighshire town, has asked the council to switch off the chimes at night.
He said the sound was keeping him and some of his guests awake.
He said: "I'm not making a big deal out of it. Maybe others are affected but choose not to mention it."
But former town mayor and Llangollen councillor Stuart Davies said: "That clock has been there since 1866 and is part of the fabric of the town."
