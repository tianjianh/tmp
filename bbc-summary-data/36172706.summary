Ryan Brobbel's first-half goal put Saints ahead against rivals appearing in their first Welsh Cup final.
Scott Quigley scored a second soon after the break as Saints added the Welsh Cup to their Welsh Premier title and Word Cup win.
Saints' win also means MBi Llandudno make next season's Europa League.
Llandudno do so after finishing third in the Welsh Premier.
Airbus had edged an evenly-contested opening half-hour with Paul Harrison denying Tony Gray while Chris Budrys failed to find the target with a free header.
Craig Harrison's side took the lead when Aeron Edwards headed down Chris Seargeant's corner for Brabbel to fire home from close range.
After the break Airbus captain Ian Kearney headed over before Quigley slotted home Saints' second three minutes later.
Saints winger Adrian Cieslewicz had an effort parried by James Coates, who also denied Quigley with his legs as Saints pressed for a third goal.
Airbus refused to give up and Kearney was denied by Harrison while at the other end Quigley and substitute Mike Wilde fired over the crossbar.
Saints' victory secured their sixth Welsh Cup while Airbus will now feature in the play-offs as they bid for a place in next season's Europa League.
New Saints director of football Craig Harrison told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It was a very tough game. We knew Airbus would make it tough for us.
"I don't think the first half was particularly pretty but I thought in the second half we were much better and we controlled the game.
"The players have got three weeks off and they will be back in training on 23 May so they've got a quick turnover and we're back at it."
Airbus UK Broughton director of football Andy Preece told BBC Wales Sport: "We're disappointed because I don't feel we deserved to lose the game. I think in the first half we were the better team by a long way.
"We pushed the champions all the way and probably deserved more from it. We have to take a lot out of that and take into the [play-off] game against Newtown."
