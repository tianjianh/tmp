The index rose 23.82 points to 7,543.77.
Bus and rail operator First Group saw its share price tumble 5% on Thursday after giving a cautious trading outlook.
It was the biggest loser on the FTSE 250, despite reporting a 23% rise in pre-tax profits to £207m for the year to the end of March.
The FTSE 250 closed up 38.45 points at 20,010.62.
Amongst FTSE 100 companies, Bookmaker Paddy Power led the risers, up 4.34% at £84.20. Housebuilder Taylor Wimpey was the biggest faller, down 6.45% at 190p.
At the start of the day, Barclays had topped the FTSE 100's list of gainers after announcing that it had sold off a bigger stake than expected in its African unit.
However, by lunchtime it had fallen back and closed just 0.5% higher on the day.
The share sale brought in £2.2bn for Barclays and reduces its stake in Barclays Africa to about 15% as the bank refocuses on the UK and US markets.
On the currency markets, the pound was 0.04% lower against the dollar at $1.28850 but up 0.25% against the euro at 1.1498 euros.
