[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sex ban man John O'Neill 'violent to all partners'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who must notify police 24 hours before he has sex told a nurse he had been violent to every girl he had slept with, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John O'Neill, 45, from York, lost his bid to have his Sexual Risk Order (SRO) lifted. He was cleared of rape last year.
However, a judge at York Magistrates' Court said the order should be amended, describing it as "unpoliceable".
North Yorkshire Police has said it was satisfied the order was proportionate.
The SRO requires Mr O'Neill to disclose any planned sexual activity to the police or face up to five years in prison.
Oliver Thorne, for the police, read extracts from a report written by a community psychiatric nurse who spoke to Mr O'Neill in 2014.
Her notes said he had been sexually violent to past girlfriends and he was "not sure" if they had consented.
He told her he needed women "to be scared" during sex or "I don't respond", the court heard.
The nurse noted he had suicidal thoughts and had been "preoccupied with killing himself and others" - an idea he found "soothing".
She also wrote Mr O'Neill thought "it would be safer for everyone if he was dead".
Magistrates were also told about a conversation between the father-of-two and his GP in which he discussed "biting and choking" sexual partners.
Dr Miriam Hodgson wrote her patient had "homicidal and suicidal thoughts" and had said his sex life had become violent.
Her notes added: "Thinks he may have raped someone, it went further than she expected" and "Patient thinks he is dangerous and needs to be stopped."
Mr O'Neill also told her he thought about killing a partner "a lot" and had "choked her unconscious several times," the court heard.
Earlier, Mr O'Neill had told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that he was homeless and sleeping rough in a wood near York.
The hearing continues.
