Katie Locke, 23, was found dead at Theobolds Park Hotel in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire. She had been strangled.
Carl Langdell admitted the charge of murder when he appeared at St Albans Crown Court via a video link from Bedford Prison.
A psychiatric report is to be prepared on Langdell who was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on 18 April.
Ann Evans, for the prosecution, said: "What needs to be established are the circumstances of Katie's death. There was a no comment interview with the police."
Benjamin Aina QC, defending, said Langdell admitted deliberately and intentionally killing Katie in a hotel room.
He said his client had been seeking psychiatric help after being convicted of making threats to kill in Bristol.
Miss Locke's family were in court for the hearing. In a statement released by police at the time of her death, they said: "As a family we are distraught, in shock and totally devastated. There was not a bad bone in Katie's body.
"Katie worked hard and loved her job as a teacher. In what little spare time she had she enjoyed sports.
"We now feel like our future has been stolen from us."
