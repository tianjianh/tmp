Merlin shares dropped 4% after it said the disruption caused by the crash would hit profits by up to Â£47m.
The FTSE 100 index was down 13.42 points at 6,566.39.
Shares in Pearson were down 3.5% after it confirmed it was in talks to sell its 50% stake in the Economist.
Reckitt Benckiser topped the risers list, with its shares up 2.8% after the consumer goods firm raised its full-year revenue targets.
The firm, whose products include Durex condoms and Nurofen painkillers, said it was now aiming for like-for-like net revenue growth of 4-5%.
This came after it reported first-quarter like-for-like sales growth of 5%.
Mining shares were also having a better day after the gold price - which saw sharp falls last week - edged higher. Shares in Randgold Resources rose 1.8%.
On the currency markets, the pound was flat against the dollar at $1.5509 but fell 0.8% against the euro to â‚¬1.4016.
The euro had been bolstered by an upbeat German business confidence survey, with the Ifo institute's business climate index rising to 108.0 from June's revised figure of 107.5.
The figure was better than expected and followed two months of declines.
