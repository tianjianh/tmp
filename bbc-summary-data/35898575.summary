[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Over 30 buildings have been granted listed status in Belfast, including properties on a street immortalised in song by Van Morrison.

Included on the new list are semi-detached properties known as 'Plevna Villas', which straddle Cyprus Avenue, the Beersbridge Road and the Upper Newtownards Road.
The list includes eight churches of various dates and styles.
A stable yard and three parliamentary boundary posts are also listed.
The Department of the Environment (DoE) listing recognises the architectural and historic interest of a wide range of structures spanning over a century of the city's development.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said the announcement was "a real boost for Belfast".
"From older and modern churches, graveyard monuments and pillar boxes, to a stable yard which is part of the outbuildings that once housed 'Tipperary Tim',  winner of the 1928 Aintree Grand National, they all have fascinating stories to tell.
"Listing these structures will ensure their important cultural assets are preserved and protected."
Speaking about the Cyprus Avenue buildings, Mr Durkan said: "These four houses were erected following the industrial expansion of the Belfast and County Down Railway.
"They were designed by well known local architects Young and MacKenzie, best known for their work on buildings such as the former Robinson and Cleaver, and Anderson and McAuley department stores."
Other buildings listed are former estate workers' cottages and two pavilion buildings on the Stormont Estate, and Fernhill House in Glencairn Park.
The eight churches range in style, from the more traditional Gothic Revival examples at Ballysillan Presbyterian and Cavehill Methodist churches in north Belfast, to the modernist design of Orangefield Baptist Church in east Belfast, built in 1968.
North Belfast has its own modernist example dating from 1964 - the chapel at Dominican College, Fortwilliam Park, which was influenced by Le Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamps in France.
The three parliamentary boundary posts, from 1918, are in Gilnahirk Road and King's Road.
They mark the outer extent of the Belfast Corporation and Pottinger electoral ward division, and are of historical significance as a remnant of the first election in Britain and Ireland when nearly everyone - bar women under 30 - had the right to vote.
