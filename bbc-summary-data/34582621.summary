[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Police Scotland helicopter crashed onto the busy Clutha bar on 29 November 2013, killing 10 people.
Air accident investigators said in an interim report that both engines cut out, but did not identify a cause.
They will discuss the findings of their final report during meetings with relatives on Wednesday and Thursday.
The Police Scotland Eurocopter EC 135, operated by Bond Air Services, came down on to the roof of the Clutha Bar at about 22:25 on a busy Friday night.
The helicopter crew who were killed were pilot David Traill, PC Tony Collins and PC Kirsty Nelis.
The seven customers in the Clutha who died were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Samuel McGhee and Joe Cusker.

The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued an interim report last year which said that both engines on the helicopter "flamed out" due to a fuel supply problem.
The report, however, did not set out the cause.
The AAIB is expected to publish its final report on the crash on Friday.
Ahead of publication it has called meetings with relatives of those who died to discuss the report findings.
These will take place at a location in Glasgow on Wednesday and Thursday before the final report is made public.
