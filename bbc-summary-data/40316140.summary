Liam Lindsay: Partick Thistle defender opts not to join Oxford United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle defender Liam Lindsay has opted not to join Oxford United because of uncertainty over Michael Appleton's future.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Oxford boss Appleton has been linked with a move to Premier League club Leicester City to become assistant manager to Craig Shakespeare.
Thistle had accepted a bid worth an initial Â£300,000 for the centre-back.
But Lindsay, 21, is reluctant to move to the League One club if a change of manager is imminent.
The defender is content to stay with the Jags for now, for whom he scored seven goals in 42 appearances last season.
