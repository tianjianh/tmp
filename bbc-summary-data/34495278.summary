The body was discovered by a member of the public at about 06:40 BST on Carr House Drive in Newton Hall.
Durham Police said the investigation was at an early stage, but officers were keen to trace anyone who had seen the man in the time leading up to his death.
He is described as white, with glasses and white/grey hair and blue eyes.
He was wearing brown walking boots, dark blue jeans, a light blue fleece, navy waterproof coat and a navy flat cap.
Det Supt Adrian Green said: "The man's body has yet to be removed and forensic work is under way at the scene.
"The forensic work may take some time and I would ask for patience from the local community while it is carried out."
