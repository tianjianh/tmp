[SN]TITLE[SN]
May's efficient and clinical reshuffle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reshuffles are often chaotic affairs, and go badly wrong.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It's said, in recent years, an unnamed minister had to wait a couple of days to be informed about his new post because a Post-It note with his name on it had dropped off the board, and, in the frenzy, he was completely forgotten.
Theresa May's first reshuffle in contrast has felt efficient in its method, and clinical in its politics.
By removing a group seen as a clique, with Michael Gove and Nicky Morgan following George Osborne out of the door, she calls a formal halt to the influence of the so-called Notting Hill Tories - those modernisers who had gathered around David Cameron's leadership and owned the top echelons of the Tory Party for so long.
But it's not as simple as "out with the old, and in with the new" because some experienced ministers who have been around are being rewarded for years of sober work - grafters, more "gin and Jag" Conservatives than metropolitan movers.
By also including Eurosceptics like David Davis, Liam Fox and Andrea Leadsom, Theresa May insures herself against some protests from those who campaigned to leave the EU that Brexit isn't moving fast enough.
But there are new faces as well - promotions for Karen Bradley, James Brokenshire, Baroness Evans  - not well known, a political generation that's come after David Cameron and George Osborne.
The new prime minister has moved quickly to stamp her brand all over a new administration.
It feels less like a reshuffle, more like a new government. On Day Two in the job, these decisions however agonising, might be the easy part.
