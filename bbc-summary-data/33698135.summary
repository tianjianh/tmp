Tom Cooper struck 104 and Peter Trego hit 53 as the hosts posted an imposing 327-8, despite John Hastings' 5-41.
But openers Mark Stoneman (112) and Phil Mustard (98) shared a record-breaking 211 for the first wicket to get Durham's chase off to a flyer.
Scott Borthwick added 66 not out from 47 balls to see the visitors to 331-3.
The opening stand of Stoneman and Mustard was Durham's highest against county opposition in one-day cricket, breaking the record of 177 for the third wicket against Surrey in 2000.
It also paved the way for Borthwick to come in and smash 10 fours and one six in his unbeaten cameo, sealing victory with 21 balls to spare.
Durham captain Mark Stoneman:
"It was a very good surface and I think that was one of the bonuses of batting second - we knew what we had to get and we could bat on a good wicket.
"It's been a brilliant start for us. That's nine wins in a row in white-ball cricket, including last summer, and hopefully we can continue that."
Somerset batsman Tom Cooper:
"It was very nice on a personal note to score a hundred, but you play the game to contribute to wins and it's very disappointing that we couldn't quite get over the line.
"The way their two openers played I don't think it would have mattered what total we would have put on the board. We hung in there until the end and it was a good effort, just disappointing."
