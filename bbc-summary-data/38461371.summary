New Year Honours 2017: Salford fundraiser Keith Tulsie receives BEM

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who helped to raise Â£100,000 for disadvantaged children has said he is "over the moon" at being recognised in the New Year Honours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Keith Tulsie, a BT manager from Salford, began fundraising after the death of a friend's daughter from a heart condition at the age of 19.
The 52-year-old said he was "humbled" to be given a British Empire Medal.
"Receiving this award means so much to me and everybody involved with Georgia's Children of the World."
The charity was set up after the death of Georgia Murray in 2010.
Since then, four learning centres have been established to support the education and development of underprivileged children in Cambodia and Romania.
This year, the charity opened its fifth venue - known as a Georgia's House - in Salford.
About 3,500 people also attended the annual G-Fest music festival in Worsley this spring to raise funds.
Mr Tulsie's name was put forward by former colleague Roy Hammond who helped to decorate one of the centres.
He said he nominated him because of "the colossal passion and pride Keith showed for the charity was so obvious that I felt compelled to try and publicly acknowledge his commitment".
