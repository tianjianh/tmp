[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lutz Bachmann escaped a prison sentence but was fined â‚¬9,600 (Â£7,600; $11,000) for calling refugees "scum".
Bachmann branded the case a political show trial. His lawyer said he had not written the remarks, but the court saw a video of him defending them.
His lawyers said they would appeal. Prosecutors, who sought a seven-month jail sentence, are also appealing.
Pegida organises regular demonstrations against Islam and asylum seekers.

The rallies drew thousands of people a week at their inception in the eastern city of Dresden, and spread across German cities as a protest again Germany's open door policy for refugees, but they have drawn fewer people in recent months.
The anti-immigration demonstrations have often been met by counter-protests. Rival groups of protesters gathered outside the court in Dresden before the hearing on Tuesday.
Lutz Bachmann, 43, was accused of inciting racial hatred in Facebook posts, in which he called refugees "cattle", "scumbags" and "filth".
His lawyer, Katja Reichel, reminded the court that it was possible to hack Facebook accounts.
But the prosecution showed the court a video of Bachmann addressing a Pegida rally in February 2015. In his speech, he said his post used "a few words that any of us would use".
The month before, he had apologised for what he called "ill-considered" remarks.
The judge, Hans Hlavka, told the court that it was "clear" that Bachmann was responsible for the comments. He said the insults could not be considered to be free speech.
Mr Bachmann previously stood down as head of Pegida, after photographs emerged of him dressed as Adolf Hitler.
