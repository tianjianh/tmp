A section of the Settle to Carlisle railway line has partially reopened after a landslide at Appleby in Cumbria shut the line to all trains.

Network Rail said services were now running on one of two tracks, with a 5mph speed limit beside the site where engineers are carrying out repairs.
Buses are also running on certain services.
A spokesman blamed the landslip on Thursday on "consistent" high levels of rainfall on already saturated ground.
He added: "Our aerial footage highlighted the scale of ground movement which led us to close the line as a precaution while we confirmed the next steps to tackle this issue.
"Extensive repairs will be needed to fix this and we will have more details of this over the next few days."
Alex Hynes, managing director for Northern Rail said: "We are pleased to reinstate a limited Northern Rail Service following Network Rail's work over the weekend.
"I would like to apologise to customers for the disruption and thank them for their ongoing patience while the situation is resolved."
