Typhoon Haiyan: I should be by my wife's side

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As the international aid effort gets under way to help the millions affected in the Philippines by Typhoon Haiyan, the families of the people who are missing are desperately seeking news of their loved ones.

In the UK, Andrew Heys is searching for news of his wife Lanicar, who lived with her family in the Philippines while waiting for her UK visa to be approved.
She was in the city of Tacloban in Leyte province when Typhoon Haiyan hit - one of the worst-affected areas.
For the moment, all Andrew can do is wait in his home near Leicester and hope for good news.
"I have not heard anything at all from Lanicar since the typhoon hit on Thursday night.
"I've contacted the Red Cross by email and haven't heard anything back, but I suppose they are just so busy trying to locate people.
"I managed to speak with her cousin who lives in Cebu city, but it's the same in the Philippines as it is here - no-one can get in touch with Tacloban.
"Lanicar is still a Filipino citizen, so the UK Embassy can't help.
"We only married on 26 September, so we've only been married a month.
"Lanicar is a paediatric nurse and was going through the visa application process to get here to the UK.
"It's a very difficult and time-consuming process and she is living with her family in Tacloban while we go through it. We speak on the internet every day.
"Her father died a year ago and she went with her family to the island of Biliran where her father lived to be there for the anniversary.
"Her mother and one of her brothers are on this small island and I would imagine they have been badly affected also.
"Lanicar returned to Tacloban on Thursday with her brother and aunt, but because they had been away to a remote area for such an emotional event they weren't aware of the typhoon alerts.
"We knew that Tacloban would lose power as the government had said there would be a power outage due to the concern of flooding.
"I was speaking with her on the internet until the power went down on Thursday, and we were prepared for that.
"But we weren't expecting the devastation caused by the typhoon to be this horrific.
"Now the news just gets worse and worse.
"I'm seeing footage on the TV constantly showing areas that I know are just streets away from her home.
"Lanicar is strong and highly intelligent and I am sure she will be very resourceful for her family.
"She is a wonderful woman who is admired and loved by everyone who knows her.
"I am the luckiest man on earth to have her in my life.
"I should be by her side now, whatever the conditions there.
"I'm on the brink of getting on a plane to Cebu city and seeing if I can get across to Tacloban on a boat.
"It's so difficult to know what to do. Would I be allowed to do that?
"And once I got there, would I just be another mouth to feed?"
