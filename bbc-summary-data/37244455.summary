The 30-year-old striker's move came after a proposed move to English Championship club Reading fell through.
Reading confirmed to BBC Radio Berkshire that Gyan would not be joining the club, but would not comment on reports of him failing a medical.
Gyan returns to the Gulf nation having previously played for Al Ain.
