Roman McDonald's theory over Navenby coins find

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"Worthless" Roman coins found during a dig in Lincolnshire support a theory there was a McDonald's-style eatery on the site, archaeologists believe.

About 300 coins were unearthed during a dig in Navenby in 2013, along with the remains of several Roman buildings.
It is thought the coins were dropped by people stopping off to eat while travelling between London and York.
Project leader Ian Cox, of Navenby Archaeology Group, suggested it may have been a "Happy Charioteer".
He said due to the coins being of such low value it was likely people had discarded them while visiting the Roman equivalent of a fast-food outlet on the site.
"It wasn't a hoard, or anything like that - these were scattered about.
"It was as if people had dropped them while eating and drinking and couldn't be bothered to pick them up."
Evidence of food preparation was also found, including bones from cattle, sheep and goats.
Mr Cox said there was a lack of personal artefacts, which supported the theory the site had been used as a sort of Roman service station.
Excavations had also unearthed evidence the site was previously used as a quarry.
A full report into the dig is now being prepared, with the group hoping to excavate other parts of the village in the future.
Mr Cox said they were keen to see what happened in Navenby after the Romans left.
The coins, along with other items from the dig, will be kept at the Lincolnshire Archives.
