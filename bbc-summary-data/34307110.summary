End to private contracts 'helped fuel NHS waiting crisis'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland is the only region in the UK that is not using the private health sector to help clear hospital waiting lists.

While England, Scotland and Wales use private companies, local commissioners said they could not afford to do it.
In Scotland and Wales, NHS spending in the independent sector represents about 1% of their respective budgets.
In England, that figure is close to 7%. Officials elsewhere say outsourcing appears to keep waiting lists down.
Up until a year ago, Northern Ireland was doing this.
However, last September, the plug was pulled on a significant contract.
The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board said this had contributed to the current waiting list crisis.
The multi-million pound contract was between the Department of Health and Kingsbridge private hospital.
Chief Executive of Kingsbridge Mark Regan said people were now borrowing money in desperation to pay for their elderly parents' hip operations.
"The patients we see are now turning to other options to pay for their health care including credit unions, bank loans or family members for money," he said.
"Perhaps they aren't buying that new car in order to pay for their mother or father's hip replacement."
He told the BBC that private companies provided value for money.
"Use of the independent sector, contrary to popular belief, means we are charging exactly the same as the NHS - it is called the NHS tariff," he said.
However, the health unions argue that the Department of Health should not be funding the private sector and should plough any money back into the health service.
Patricia McKeown, of the union Unison, said she did not believe that health care should be used for profit.
"I don't know why there would be any place inside the NHS for private medicine," she said.
"Why is it that people can be offered next day treatment if they pay for it and very often by the same doctor who is the person they are seeing inside the NHS system."
The British Medical Association (BMA) said a short term financial fix to private companies was not the answer. Dr John D Woods said the BMA strongly opposed it.
"Paying private companies is a knee jerk reaction," he said.
"Yes, it may help those on a current waiting list, but it does not provide a long-term answer for the health service.
"When Northern Ireland uses the independent sector  - eventually - in the long term, it just leads to long waiting lists."
Northern Ireland's latest figures reveal a large number of specialities reporting immense pressures and worsening service provision.
The Health and Social Care Board said that, financially, the situation was so dire that they could not afford to pay either the independent sector or local health service consultants over-time to clear the backlog.
Basically, unlike England, Northern Ireland's commissioners do not have a choice.
The board's director of performance, Michael Bloomfield, said: "The major reason that we are seeing the increase in waiting times and their pace - is directly associated with the lack of funding to provide additional activity - whether that's within the health trusts or within the independent sector."
Mr Bloomfield said that while the health board would like to use the independent sector to tackle waiting lists, there simply was not the money.
Hospital delays
It had been hoped that at least Â£47m from the Northern Ireland Executive's June Monitoring round would go towards paying the private sector.
Hip, knee and back surgery would have been among the operations that could have been cleared from waiting lists.
But the current stalemate at Stormont meant that money was never released.
Mr Bloomfield said the board was in regular discussion with the trusts about waiting lists.
"You can only hold people, those managers to account for those things that are within their control. Waiting lists are increasing because there is a considerable gap between the demand for elective services and the capacity to deliver those services," he said.
"We clearly cannot hold people to account for things they cannot do."
However, Mr Bloomfield said the health trusts were under delivering by about 8% across Northern Ireland.
Should the health service spend in order to tackle the current waiting lists or turn a blind eye to those currently waiting and plan long-term instead?
Mr Regan from Kingsbridge said you cannot forget that behind the statistics are men and women who need help desperately.
Worryingly, it is predicted that hospital waiting lists are going to get worse before they get better.
