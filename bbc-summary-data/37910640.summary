Anglesey council needs to make cuts of nearly £3m in order to balance the books next year, the local authority has said.

Proposed cuts include raising primary school dinner costs, transferring heritage sites to other organisations and changing library services.
The council is also looking at increasing council tax by 3%.
The executive committee agreed to start a five-week public consultation on the proposals, beginning on Friday.
Head of resources Marc Jones said a better financial settlement from the Welsh Government for 2017-18 would not "meet a host of new demands and pressure" on the local authority.
These include an increase in inflation, an increase in the number of children brought into care, a new apprenticeship levy and increasing staff costs.
Council leader Ieuan Williams said: "There's no doubt that it's going to be another difficult year in terms of our finances; and we'll have to make some pretty tough decisions to balance the books.
"We're also looking to transform and restructure a number of services within the council in order to make additional efficiency savings.
"This year, our aim is to ensure a prudent budget which will help protect services from more stringent cuts in 2018-19 and 2019-20 when the funding we receive from Cardiff Bay is likely to be considerably less."
