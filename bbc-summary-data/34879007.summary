[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Images of a man believed to have helped "many people" during the Hillsborough disaster have again been released as part of a witness appeal.

The pictures have been published by the team probing the 1989 stadium crush in which 96 people were fatally injured.
Investigators believe the man shown, who was the subject of three earlier separate appeals, is actually the same person.
It follows more than 60 other appeals issued on behalf of the coroner.
The officer in command of Operation Resolve, Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart, said: "We have been able to establish through forensic work that appeals 32, 38 and 64 are likely to be the same person.
"We believe this man could have assisted many people on the day of the disaster and we would really like to identify him."
The photographs of those yet to be traced are shown on the Operation Resolve website.
The crush happened on the terraces at the Sheffield stadium during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15 April 1989.
Coroner Sir John Goldring is presiding over new inquests into the disaster, which are being held in Warrington, Cheshire.
