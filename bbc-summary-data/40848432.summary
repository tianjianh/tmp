[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aberdeen lost Thursday's third qualifying round second leg 2-0 in Cyprus, exiting 3-2 on aggregate.
The Dons have been charged with crowd disturbances and having no stewards travelling with their support, in contravention of Uefa regulations.
A Uefa disciplinary panel will hear the case on 17 August.
Police Scotland has confirmed that no officers travelled with Aberdeen to Cyprus or to Bosnia-Herzegovina in the previous round against Siroki Brijeg, stressing that liaison officers are only sent at the request of the host nation.
Apollon, who will face Midtjylland of Denmark in the first leg of their play-off round tie later that day, have been charged by Uefa with improper conduct by their team, who received five yellow cards, and with the setting off of fireworks and throwing of objects by their fans.
The Cypriot club had used the AEK Arena in Larnaca for the tie against Aberdeen as their Tsirio Stadium is being redeveloped.
Riot police moved into the away section as Aberdeen fans clashed with stewards following the final whistle.
Flares had been lit early in the second half in the home section, with one thrown and landing inside the goal behind Aberdeen goalkeeper Joe Lewis.
Television cameras caught Swiss referee Stephan Klossner telling an official that he would abandon the match if the behaviour did not cease.
Aberdeen, who have declined to comment, later announced they had begun an investigation into the fighting in the away section.
