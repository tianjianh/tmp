The boys, aged eleven and 12 at the time, spotted a distressed woman going into the Firth of Forth near Granton, in September 2015.
They tried to stop her, then alerted the coastguard and recorded the incident on a mobile phone.
Waca Ceesay, 12, Andrew Ball, 12, Aleks Czernecki, 13, Tyler Anderson, 13, and Kian McGee, 13, were given awards.
Kian said: "It was last year in September when we were at Gypsy Brae and we noticed her stumbling and thought something was wrong.
"She went down to the shore bit and started to strip. At first we thought it was funny and then suddenly there was a splash as she jumped into the water and we knew something was wrong."
His friend Tyler added: "We got someone who was passing by to call the police and the coastguard. She would probably have died of hypothermia if we hadn't."
The boys were among 36 police officers and 21 members of the public honoured for their courage at the Police Scotland Bravery and Meritorious Service Awards.
Among the other winners were PC Gary Cooper and PC Sarah Hay who called to a domestic incident in Kirkcaldy, Fife, in September 2014, which quickly turned violent.
PC Hay said: "It was just a domestic call and a female had reported that her husband was going crazy and smashing up the place."
The pair arrived at the house and could not see the man, but he suddenly ran through the house and was going to run away before he was restrained by PC Cooper.
The attacker started punching and kicking before launching an attack on PC Hay, who suffered an injured eye socket and facial injuries.
PC Cooper said: "It just started off a normal call at the end of a shift, you never know what's going to happen."
Chief Constable Phil Gormley, who presented the awards at Police Scotland College in Tulliallan, said: "It is genuinely humbling to hear of the extraordinary lengths people have gone to to help others.
"I was privileged to present these awards, meet the winners and to hear more about their stories.
"It is absolutely right we honour their bravery and show not only how proud we are of our police officers in Scotland, but also of members of the public who don't hesitate to take action to help another person at what could be the most difficult time of that individual's life.
"The actions of today's winners - both officers and members of the public - have undoubtedly saved lives and touched the hearts of people across the country."
