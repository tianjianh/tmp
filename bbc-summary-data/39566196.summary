Richard Browning from Salisbury, England, has invented a suit with four mini jet engines attached to the arms that allows you to take off vertically.
He wants to change the way we look at flying and hopes this jet suit will be the future.
Richard is still in the testing stage but we think it looks pretty cool. Take a look for yourself!
