[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Neil Parsons needed 167 stitches after he was attacked at a lobster festival at Hardwick Hall, Sedgefield, County Durham, in April 2012.
Teesside Crown Court heard John Mullen, 50, from Manchester, missed Mr Parsons' carotid artery by millimetres.
Mullen admitted wounding with intent and was jailed for seven-and-a-half years.
The court was told Mr Parsons runs a portable toilet business and was working at the event with his son, who witnessed the attack.
After the stabbing, Mullen, from Kearsley Road, Manchester, fled the country, flying to Abu Dhabi and then Bangkok.
He was eventually arrested in February last year when he arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria.
The hearing was told that during the event, Mr Parsons stepped in after a man was headbutted in the hotel reception and up to 20 people became involved in a scuffle which caused terrified hotel staff to lock themselves in an office for safety.
Mr Parsons suffered a 5cm (2in) V-shaped laceration in his neck and four glass fragments were stuck in the wound.
In 2014 three men were sentenced for their part in the fighting.
