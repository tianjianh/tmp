Jermaine Easter nodded Rovers ahead from Lee Brown's cross before Ollie Clarke doubled the lead with a low right-footed shot.
Jon Meades' header gave Wimbledon hope but Matt Taylor's 12-yard finish, his 19th of the season, sealed victory.
Wimbledon, who are seventh, had substitute Adebayo Akinfenwa sent off for dissent.
Fifth-placed Rovers are six points off an automatic promotion spot with 11 games to go.

"When you assess it afterwards it's not just the points you haven't gained, it's injuries and now suspensions."
"As far as the actual game goes, I thought we were really good. They were ruthless with their chances, we made some silly defensive errors at certain times and they punished us."
"I can't ask for any more. I thought in the second half particularly we ran all over them."
