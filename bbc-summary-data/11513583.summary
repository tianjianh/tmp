Project contractor Hochtief began the construction of six supports for the Â£37m Twin Sails Bridge last week.
It will span Backwater Channel in Holes Bay between Hamworthy and Poole town centre.
The first open day will be held at Hamworthy Library in Blandford Road between 1400 and 1900 BST on Wednesday.
The second one will be held at the Dolphin Shopping Centre between 0900 and 1700 GMT on 4 November.
The bridge is scheduled to open in early 2012.
Jim Bright, the Borough of Poole's strategic director, said: "We are aware that residents have questions relating to the construction of the Twin Sails Bridge and the impact of regeneration in their local community.
"By holding these open days we hope residents will take the opportunity of raising any questions or concerns they may have."
