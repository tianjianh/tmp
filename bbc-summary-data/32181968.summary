Iran press ecstatic over nuclear deal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The press in Iran is full of euphoria after a framework nuclear deal was agreed with Western powers in Lausanne on 2 April.

Most newspapers dedicate almost entire editions to the agreement, with even the art and cultural dailies making the nuclear deal their top story. The country's press on Saturday resumed publication after a two-week new year (Nowruz) holiday.
The photograph of Iranian Foreign Minister Muhammad Javad Zarif, smiling and waving at the crowds from the sunroof of a car, adorns the front pages of most dailies.
The headlines are similarly upbeat. "Diplomacy laughing" is the front-page headline in reformist E'temad. Another reformist newspaper, Shahrvand, plays on the word "Zarif", which means "elegance" in Persian. Its headline reads: "Iran's elegant passing through Lausanne's arduous winding road".
Centrist newspaper Jomhuri-ye Eslami says that the deal marks "Iran's powerful comeback". Conservative daily Resalat proclaims: "Our nation is on the cusp of a great victory".
Financial dailies point to the rise in the value of the Iranian currency soon after the announcement was made in Lausanne.
Commentators feel this augurs very well for the economy, and are hopeful that the nuclear deal will help end Iran's dependence on oil.
Tejarat daily quotes Economics Minister Ali Tayyebnia as saying that after sanctions are lifted, Iran will be able to resume exports and "to achieve this, the government will extend all possible help to the non-oil sector of industry".
A cultural and entertainment daily, Bani Film, has also dedicated its front page to the nuclear deal. In a report headlined "Impact of nuclear agreement on the cultural domain", the paper argues that "as soon as sanctions are lifted and economic activities are given a boost, Iran's cinema will also experience stimulating conditions to produce more meaningful films, without too many constraints."
Hardline and conservative papers are mild in their response to the deal, even though they were sharply critical of the talks in Lausanne. Most of them only argue over differing interpretations of the agreed terms without opposing the agreement as such.
Javan, which is affiliated to Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, says the fate of the final deal will only be decided by those who emerge victorious from this "clash of interpretations". Another hardline daily, Siyasat-e-Ruz wonders "if Iran's legitimate rights have been secured in the deal or not".
Conservative Hemayat cautions Iranian negotiators to remain on the lookout for "US slyness" when drafting the final nuclear agreement.
