[SN]TITLE[SN]
Stabbed man 'thought he was going to die'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen man has told a High Court jury he thought he was going to die after he was stabbed during a trip to Edinburgh to buy a car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Stewart, 46, said he and his brother Peter were attacked at Wardieburn Street West last April.
He told the High Court in Livingston: "I thought I was dying."
Ryan Ellis, 31, and a 17-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons deny robbing and attempting to murder Peter Stewart and assaulting James Stewart.
Mr Stewart said: "I didn't know if I was going to die. I didn't know if I was going to see my kids or anyone again. I was in a strange place. I was panicking."
The jury heard a recording of the 999 call in which Mr Stewart said he could see "serious bleeding" from his brother.
He said: "It's really pretty bad. Peter, are you OK? Peter, who am I?"
The court has heard Peter Stewart was stabbed through the heart and lung and would have died from his injuries without medical intervention.
Under cross examination, Mr Stewart admitted that he and his brother were regular cannabis users.
However, despite being offered immunity from prosecution for drugs offences by the prosecution, he firmly rejected suggestions that he and his brother had gone to Edinburgh to buy cannabis.
The trial, before Lord Glennie, continues.
