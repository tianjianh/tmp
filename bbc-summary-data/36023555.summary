Emily Rycroft, from Grimsby, became stuck in the building on Monday evening after going inside to collect an essay.
The 21-year-old told her mother who tweeted Radio 2 stars Jo Whiley and Jeremy Vine.
After the DJs retweeted the plea, a key holder was found and she was let out after a couple of hours.
Ms Rycroft, who is studying philosophy, politics and ethics, said: "I was going home from my boyfriend's house and I thought I would stop and pick up an essay that had been handed back in.
"I thought I'd nip to the toilet downstairs, had five minutes to spare before they closed up, but I think someone fancied going home early.
"They had locked the doors and must not have heard or seen me come in. I rang my mum and she thought I was joking."
Her mother, Gillian, set about tweeting the celebrities whose retweets were seen. Security staff then let Ms Rycroft out of the building
"It was amazing [to be let out] - so nice to feel the air again," she said.
A university spokesman said: "As soon as our security staff were informed of the incident they attended and released the student.
"The building was being locked a little earlier than usual and we apologise for any distress this may have caused the student and her family."
