Soni Sori said men on a motorcycle had stopped her car, forced her to get out and thrown liquid on her face. Doctors told police it was not acid.
"The liquid caused a burning sensation and I am still unable to see," Ms Sori told BBC Hindi from hospital.
She is a member of Delhi's governing Aam Aadmi Party.
Ms Sori is an outspoken critic of police violence towards tribespeople in Chhattisgarh, which is facing a Maoist insurgency.
She was arrested in 2011 on charges of being a courier for the Maoists and has alleged she was tortured and sexually assaulted by Chhattisgarh police during her imprisonment.
More recently she has alleged harassment by government officials in the area.
Chhattisgarh police official Kamlochan Kashyap told BBC Hindi an investigation had been launched into the latest attack.
