Kyle Careford, 20, and Michael Owen, 21, from Tunbridge Wells, died in the crash in Rotherfield Road, Crowborough in East Sussex in April.
The video, released by Sussex Police with the support of the men's families, was filmed on Mr Owen's phone.
Both men died instantly as the Renault Clio crashed into a church wall.
Sussex Police said Mr Careford, who was driving, did not have a licence.
The footage shows the two men laughing and singing, as Mr Owen appears to give his friend a driving lesson.
The car careered off the road just after Mr Owen asked the driver to slow down.
Both men had taken a "cocktail" of prescribed and illegal drugs, police said.
Mr Owen's mother Kat said she "blames" both of the men for the "decisions they made".
"If all this stops one person from making the same mistake, then some good has come from showing this video," she said.
"I'm hoping it will have an impact on young people and make them see that a bit of fun can have such devastating consequences.
"Watching the video was very upsetting, but I'm hoping it can be used in a positive way, by showing young people what could happen to them."
Mr Careford's brother Zac Hemming, added: "This footage or anything of its kind should never be recorded, let alone watched.
"However, despite the pain of it being broadcast by the media, we as a family just hope and pray that this will connect with at least one person out there, young or old, so that no-one ever has to experience the unthinkable pain of losing someone so close and dearly loved."
Police said witnesses reported seeing the car at various times in the hours leading up to the crash.
A taxi driver said he had been forced off the carriageway by a speeding red car on the wrong side of the road.
A woman also witnessed the car doing "doughnuts" in a car park in Crowborough.
