Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said the president would suspend all international travel until February.
He said Ms Fernandez had slipped on a liquid spilled on the floor of her home in Patagonia, in southern Argentina.
The president has had a series of health problems, some of which have forced her to cancel official trips.
Ms Fernandez was due to travel to Brazil for the inauguration on 1 January of President Dilma Rousseff, who has been elected to a second term in office.
She will also miss a trip to the Vatican alongside the Chilean President, Michelle Bachelet.
In November, Ms Fernandez had to cancel her attendance at a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the signing of a peace treaty with Chile, which Ms Bachelet was also due to attend.
At the time, the Argentine leader was suffering from a sigmoiditis, an inflammation or infection of the sigmoid colon.
Last year, she had to rest for a month after undergoing surgery to treat bleeding on the brain.
President Fernandez, of the left-wing Front for Victory party, was first elected in 2007 and then returned to power by a comfortable majority in 2011.
