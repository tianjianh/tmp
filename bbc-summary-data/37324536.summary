Rapper Bobby Shmurda agrees to plea deal on conspiracy charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
US rapper Bobby Shmurda has agreed to a plea deal on charges of conspiracy and possession of a weapon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Under the deal, he will face a minimum of seven years in prison to avoid going on trial on weapons and drugs charges.
He had been accused of conspiring with a Brooklyn street gang involved in violent drug wars.
Shmurda, whose real name is Ackquille Pollard, is best known for the hit song Hot Boy and the "Shmoney" dance which featured in one of his videos.
The rapper has been in jail since late 2014, along with 15 other defendants who were accused of crimes including murder, attempted murder and drug dealing.
A reporter for TMZ magazine, who was in court, heard their lawyer advising them to take the deal because they would never get a sympathetic jury and some of them were facing life.
If Shmurda had refused the deal and gone on trial, he would have faced decades in prison.
He has already served 20 months, which will be taken into account when a release date is set.
