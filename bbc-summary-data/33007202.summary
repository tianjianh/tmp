Events planned include a musical relay along the 73-mile length of Hadrian's Wall and a live concert in Crumlin Road Gaol, a former prison in Belfast.
The day culminates in a gala concert from Glasgow's City Halls.
Jamie Cullum, Deacon Blue and Lulu will be among the performers at the event.
Events in Cardiff include an attempt to set a new world record for the greatest distance between singers of a duet.
Accompanied by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, classical singer Shan Cothi in Cardiff will sing the Welsh hymn Calon Lan with Andres Evans, a member of the Welsh community in Patagonia.
Events and performances will be broadcast across the BBC, with BBC One's The One Show broadcasting live from the Music Day event in Glasgow.
BBC Music director Bob Shennan said the day was "a unique opportunity for people to celebrate music and musical talent, whether attending one of the many events taking place or tuning in at home".
Highlights in each location include:
The Hadrian's Wall of Sound event will see hundreds of local musicians travel the length of the wall using various modes of transport and a baton passed from performer to performer.
Friday will also see the fifth and final BBC Music Day Unsung Hero named on Steve Wright's Radio 2 show and performances and appearances from the event's starry line-up of ambassadors.
The BBC Music initiative officially launched in October 2014 with an all-star reworking of the Beach Boys' God Only Knows.
