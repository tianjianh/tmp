[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Patrick Bauer left it late to rescue a point for Charlton by equalising deep into stoppage time against Sheffield United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game was immediately disrupted on the opening whistle as Addicks fans pelted the pitch with miniature footballs and taxis in protest against absentee Belgian owner Roland Duchatelet.
Josh Magennis saw a ninth-minute effort cancelled out for offside, while Charlton keeper Dillon Phillips' blushes were spared when his clearance hit Leon Clarke and flew just off target.
Sheffield United broke the deadlock on 32 minutes when John Fleck's free-kick was played short to Mark Duffy inside the box, who cleverly lifted an angled shot from the right of the area and into the net.
Billy Sharp almost added a second with the last kick of the opening half but instead fired straight at the Charlton keeper.
Sharp's overhead kick was easily dealt with by Phillips early in the second period and moments later the home stopper was at full stretch to tip behind Fleck's long-range drive.
Phillips came to the rescue once again for Charlton with a top class save to somehow deny Duffy and was on hand to prevent substitute Caolan Lavery heading home 10 minutes from time.
They paid the price deep into stoppage time when Bauer met Adam Chicksen's free-kick and prodded in from close range to spoil Sheffield United's day.
