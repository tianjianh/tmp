The biggest sporting shocks in 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After the staggering sporting highs of the previous two years, 2014 had a lot to live up to.

While there were no Olympic Games or home-grown men's singles champion to get excited about, one thing this year did have was sporting shocks, and lots of them.
There were defeats on the biggest stage that left spectators speechless.
And there were athletes who secured unexpected and uplifting triumphs that no-one saw coming.
Top of the pile was of course the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.
The Australian batsman was playing for New South Wales when he was hit on the neck by a bouncer from Sean Abbott.
He collapsed to the floor and never regained consciousness. He was 25.
Hughes' death caused an outpouring of grief around the cricketing world, and in particular in Australia.
As for results that came as a huge surprise, this year's World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany in Rio de Janeiro takes some beating.
The hosts were far from a vintage Brazil side but they had stumbled into the last four largely on the back of the inspirational Neymar.
He missed the semi-final because of injury leaving his teammates in disarray; they were five goals down within 19 minutes, eventually losing 7-1.
Brazil fans wept and the Selecao were forever tarnished.
Domestically, a sign of just how far Manchester United had fallen in the post-Fergie era came when the red devils were humbled by the MK Dons in the League Cup second round.
That club only came into existence in 2004.
The match finished 4-0 to the League One side and United fans were left fearing that life under Van Gaal could be even worse than during the Moyes era.
Fortunately for them it now seems their fears were unfounded.
Glasgow's Commonwealth Games was flush with home-grown successes, but none came as more of a pleasant surprise than the performance of Jo Pavey.
The 40-year-old was supposedly past her best, with two children at home, yet she impressed in securing a bronze in the 5000m.
It was at the European Championships a few weeks later that she really surprised the experts, with a gold medal in the 10,000m in Zurich.
She was the oldest woman to ever claim gold at the European Championships, at an age when most athletes are long since retired.
