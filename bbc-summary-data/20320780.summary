Pat Finucane murder: Vetting 'sanitises' de Silva report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane have said they believe government vetting of a report into the killing will have "sanitised it".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Secretary of State Theresa Villiers has said the report will be published, in full, in the week of 10 December.
Mr Finucane was shot by loyalists in front of his family in his north Belfast home in 1989.
His family have said that the report falls well short of the full public inquiry they have campaigned for.
Sir Desmond de Silva QC was asked to undertake a legal review of the case, amid long-running allegations of state collusion in the murder.
Mr Finucane's widow, Geraldine, said the announcement that it would be published in full was not a guarantee of openness and transparency.
"Vital information has already been removed from the report by the de Silva review team prior to checking by security officials, MOD personnel and the PSNI," she said.
"By the time the report is made public it will have been sanitised completely, to ensure that the least possible amount of discomfort is caused to the government and the British state."
