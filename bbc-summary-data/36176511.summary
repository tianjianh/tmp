The Cobblers took the lead when Nicky Adams crossed in for Jack Whatmough to put the ball into his own net.
The hosts had Kieron Freeman sent off for a challenge on John Joe O'Toole but restored parity a minute later when Kal Naismith fired from 25 yards.
James Collins sealed victory for the visitors when he tucked home David Buchanan's cross from close range.
Because the result meant they finished sixth, Portsmouth will now play Plymouth in the play-offs.
Paul Cook's side will play at Fratton Park on 12 May in the first leg before the reverse fixture at Plymouth's Home Park on 15 May.
Northampton's victory means they have gone 24 games unbeaten in League Two, as they finish the season 13 points clear at the top of the League Two table.

Portsmouth assistant manager Leam Richardson told BBC Radio Solent: "It is a 2-1 defeat, it is not in good taste.
"Obviously going down to 10 men so early in the second half doesn't help. With 11 men on the pitch we would have expected a different result.
"There were two good teams on the pitch, we are playing against the champions so you have got to give them every credit."
