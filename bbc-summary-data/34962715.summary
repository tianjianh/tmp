It comes from the iconic installation at the Tower of London which attracted more than five million visitors.
The Weeping Window is taken from the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red exhibit of 888,246 poppies which represented deaths in the British and colonial forces between 1914 and 1918.
It will be on show from next October.
Deputy culture minister Ken Skates said he was delighted Caernarfon Castle has been chosen to host the poignant display over some key dates in 2016, including Remembrance Sunday.
The Weeping Window is currently on show in Liverpool.
Wrexham council has lost out on its bid to host an exhibit called Wave, a sweeping arch of bright red poppy heads which is currently on show at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park.
Council leader Mark Pritchard said: "I am, of course, very disappointed that the poppies will not be coming to Wrexham next year."
