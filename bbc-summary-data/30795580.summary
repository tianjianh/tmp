George Tonkinson's parents, Lewis and Sally, of Cookhill, Worcestershire, were killed in the crash in Hampshire on 3 January.
Jim Turner, head teacher of King's Hawford school in Worcester, took presents to him in hospital on Monday.
He said George, who suffered serious injuries, was making a "remarkable" recovery.
The aircraft came down in Blackwood Forest, south of the A303 near Popham airfield, after taking off from Bembridge on the Isle of Wight on 3 January.
Mr Turner said the six year old "loved" reading the cards at Birmingham Children's Hospital and hearing the audio messages sent to him from fellow pupils.
His friends also sent him a teddy bear and made a song for him.
One pupil said: "Please do come back to school soon. We all miss you lots and our whole school misses you."
Mr Turner added: "I think the messages that we sent in yesterday from the children were a great help to him. They made him smile.
"He's got his family around him. He's got older siblings who are caring for him now. He's got obviously his grandparents too."
The head teacher said he hoped George, who is recovering from head and arm injuries, would be back at school towards the end of this term or the start of next.
In the meantime, he said he was going to see George "on a regular basis" and the school would help him with lessons at home.
