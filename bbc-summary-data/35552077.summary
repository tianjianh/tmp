Flag poles at Donald Trump's Scottish golf course hit planning hitch

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf course has been forced to apply for retrospective planning permission for two large flag poles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after the 24m (80ft) poles appeared close to the MacLeod House hotel and near the clubhouse at Mr Trump's Menie site.
There have been concerns the poles are too large and bids for planning permission have now been submitted.
The US presidential candidate's resort has been a focus for local protest.
Mr Trump has called the links course one of the finest in the world.
A legal challenge by the tycoon over plans for an offshore wind farm on the Aberdeenshire coast was rejected by the UK's Supreme Court.
