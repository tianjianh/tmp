David McAlinden has been appointed as the new manager of Carrick Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 33-year-old captained the club to the Championship and Intermediate Cup victories in the 2010/2011 season.
McAlinden left East Antrim rivals Larne at the end of last season and said: "I'm obviously delighted to get the opportunity to manage the club that I've had an affiliation with before".
Carrick maintained Irish Premiership status after beating Institute in the promotion/relegation play-off.
Aaron Callaghan quit as Carrick boss before the end of the season, having succeeded Gary Haveron in the position last October.
McAlinden's backroom staff will include Michael Press as his assistant manager, who was with him in his job at Larne.
"Me and Michael are looking forward to getting started now and getting our teeth into the challenge," he stated.
"I've always aspired to manage in the Premiership and that's what attracted me to the job and I have no doubt in the ability that me and the coaching staff will bring to the club.
"There's a lot of work to be done straight away, and that's what our initial aim will be, shaping a squad for pre-season that we think will compete and ultimately strive to do better than [last] season."
