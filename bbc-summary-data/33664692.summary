It is creating 300 jobs at its existing US operation in Pennsylvania in a £20m investment.
Almac has been operating in the US for 20 years.
The move will see the company employing 5,000 people worldwide by next year - about 60% of them in Northern Ireland.
As well as updating its HQ facilities, Almac is investing a further £2m in a business it acquired last year in the Republic of Ireland, the Arran Chemical Company.
Alan Armstrong, chief executive of Almac, said: "We are looking forward to an exciting future.
"Due to significant industry demand for our services it is essential we build capacity and increase headcount to ensure we continue to compete at a global level."
The business started 40 years ago and is one of Northern Ireland's most successful companies.
