[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new app to help doctors with referrals for patients suspected of having cancer has been launched.

It features a quick reference guide for health professionals, including information on symptoms, signs and images of what to look out for.
It is available as a free download via the Apple and Google app stores.
The Scottish government commissioned the development of the app version of the Scottish Referral Guidelines for Suspected Cancer.
It was produced by the Scottish Centre for Enabling Technologies, based at the University of the West of Scotland.
The app can be continually updated when the user is in a wi-fi zone, giving them the latest information as quickly as possible. It can also be used offline.
Health Secretary Shona Robison said: "This app, which has been developed in partnership with health professionals and patients, will make it easier and quicker for doctors, pharmacists and senior nurses to access information on referral for those suspected of having cancer.
"The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treated, the better the survival outcomes.
"Improving the number of patients diagnosed at an early stage will reduce premature deaths from cancer and have a positive effect on overall life expectancy.
"I would therefore urge all relevant health professionals to download and use this free app."
Dr Douglas Rigg, a Glasgow GP who was involved in the development of the app, said: "The app brings us quick access to information to support clinical decision-making.
"Mobile devices are becoming an integral part of GPs' equipment and apps like this are part of the future of primary care and for GPs keeping knowledge up to date."
