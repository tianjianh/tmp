Nanny faces extradition to US over child abuse charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nanny wanted in the US on a child pornography charge has lost a UK court fight against extradition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
British citizen Nicky Paul Mitchell claimed that being sent to the US would breach his human rights.
He argued that if found guilty, he could face indefinite detention as a sex offender and two decades in jail.
But two High Court judges rejected his case, two years after the US Department of Justice called for his extradition.
The allegations against Mr Mitchell relate to 2013 when he worked as a nanny to a family in Georgia with three children.
An undercover FBI officer used a peer-to-peer online network and observed that someone with the username Mitch287 had 897 files in a protected folder - containing images of boys exposing themselves or engaging in sexual acts.
In March 2014, after a federal grand jury hearing in Atlanta, Georgia, Mr Mitchell was accused of inter-state distribution of child pornography.
The charge does not involve allegations of "contact molestation" with any child, that court heard.
After the US requested his extradition to Atlanta in October 2014, Mr Mitchell was arrested in the UK and appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court, which referred his case to the then home secretary Theresa May.
In April 2015, she agreed to the extradition.
Mr Mitchell appealed on the grounds that if convicted, he faced the risk of a civil commitment order under which he would face indefinite detention as a sex offender, as well as a lengthy prison sentence.
But Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Nicol rejected his claim and he now faces extradition.
Mr Justice Nicol said an assurance had been received from the US Department of Justice that Mr Mitchell, if found guilty, would be deported from America "as quickly as possible" on completing any prison sentence.
