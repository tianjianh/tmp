The Scot, who collected £200,000 after winning the China Championship last Saturday, earned another £100,000 after his 10-7 victory on Saturday.
Five-time world champion O'Sullivan, 40, had led 5-4 going into the evening session in the best-of-19-frame final.
Higgins, 41, won six of the next eight frames to beat O'Sullivan.
Four-time world champions Higgins momentarily lost concentration during the presentation.
He dropped the trophy on to the table, much to the amusement of the crowd at the Ricoh Arena.
"I can't speak for Ronnie but I was buzzed up coming into play. I just wish my old man was still here to see me take part in these finals," said Higgins, whose father died from cancer in 2011.
"There is no better feeling than doing it in front of a packed audience, playing against somebody as good as Ronnie."
O'Sullivan, who beat Mark Allen 6-2 on Friday to reach the final, said last month he was "not good enough to compete with the best players in the world".
He won his sixth Masters title in January and the Welsh Open in February.
"I need to find some consistency if I am going to win tournaments again," he said.
"Against most players I might have had a chance of winning but against world-class opposition I make too many mistakes."
