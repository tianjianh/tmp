Inverness Caledonian Thistle 3-1 Dundee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness Caledonian Thistle claimed their second Scottish Premiership win of the season as Dundee left the Highlands without a point.

Lonsana Doumbouya netted his first Inverness goal early on and Greg Tansey's penalty doubled the hosts' lead.
Liam Polworth's effort all but settled the match after the break.
However, Nicky Low reduced Dundee's deficit with an impressive free-kick late in the match.
There was a confidence about the home side off the back of a three-game unbeaten run.
For the opener, Brad McKay's cross from the right was accuracy itself, thrown in with the pace to allow Doumbouya to brilliantly glance the ball into the corner beyond Scott Bain.
Tansey was typically clinical with his penalty finish after Julen Extabeguren was adjudged to have barged Billy King in the box
The killer third arrived early in the second half with Dundee pressing. McKay got the break of the ball and fed Polworth, who ran in on Bain and slotted calmly into the corner.
There's no question Dundee are threatening going forward but just could not find a route past Owain Fon Williams until Low's curling free-kick from the inside-right channel.
The goalkeeper was superb last week against Celtic and pulled off a crucial first-half block from Cammy Kerr at 2-0.
Faissal El Bakhtoui had a number of efforts from distance and Paul McGowan was unfortunate to see a shot deflected wide before the third Inverness goal.
Defensively, they perhaps need to be a bit more solid with all three Inverness goals requiring more authority at the back from Dundee.
Kevin Holt almost cost them a fourth with a terrible back-pass but Bain bailed him out, saving from Jake Mulraney who ought to have netted.
Paul Hartley's men will need to be better at the back and more clinical when chances come their way, with Celtic next to visit Dens Park.
Question marks were raised very early this season when Inverness started poorly but they are now moving up the table.
One negative might be a couple of challenges by Doumbouya. He ended the game with a booking in addition to his goal but may have also picked up a red card had referee Kevin Clancy not shown leniency.
But, overall, manager Richie Foran can reflect on a fine afternoon's work.

Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We're going in the right direction. I thought we were ruthless in front of goal today. That's what we've been looking for.
"Good results breed confidence. We're climbing that table, looking up now. We've been through our bad patch. We didn't let it affect us.
"We were mentally strong and now we're starting to look good but I still believe there's a lot more to come from us."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley: "It was a poor performance. The goals we lost were poor on our part.
"As a team we've got to be better, show more desire. I didn't think we offered enough in terms of the final third.
"As a team we didn't play well. There's not many players with pass marks today. It was our performance today that let us down."
