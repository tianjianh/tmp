The officer left the bag containing the Pava spray, which is used to incapacitate suspects, and handcuffs on a pavement near Lower Vauvert in St Peter Port on Friday night.
On Tuesday, all items except the spray were found in wasteland off Park Lane.
Guernsey Police said it would not comment on whether any disciplinary action would follow.
Det Sgt Jason Savident said: "The officer had mistakenly left the bag at the scene after he arrested and helped escort a potentially volatile suspect to the police station.
"While we are pleased to recover the bag and the majority of its contents, and would wish to thank the member of the public who notified us, we remain concerned that the spray is still unaccounted for.
"Pava will not result in any lasting harmful effects, but nevertheless it is designed to temporarily incapacitate and we are concerned that someone is in possession of the spray who is not licensed to be."
