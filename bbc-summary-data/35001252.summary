IAAF opens bids to reallocate events after Russia's suspension

The IAAF has reopened the bidding to find alternative hosts for two events, following Russia's suspension from international athletics competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The country's athletics federation was banned after a World Anti-Doping Agency independent commission alleged "state-sponsored doping".
Russia was due to host the World Race Walking Team Championships and the World Junior Championships in 2016.
Countries must register their interest in hosting the events by 7 December.
The IAAF will then vote on which city will host the events on 7 January.
