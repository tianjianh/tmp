[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barrow extended their club-record unbeaten run to 19 matches with a home victory over relegation-threatened Guiseley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took a while for the Cumbrian club to find their rhythm but, when they did, Jordan Williams beat Dan Atkinson with a thunderous 20-yard shot.
Paul Cox's men once again rode the tide of euphoria, and Byron Harrison took his season's tally to 14 with a brace - putting him clear in second place in the National League scoring charts.
The first was an accurate header on the stroke of half-time. He then added a penalty after the break when Marcus Williams fouled Ryan Yates.
