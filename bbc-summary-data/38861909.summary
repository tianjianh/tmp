Laura Deas: Welsh skeleton athlete finishes seventh in World Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh skeleton athlete Laura Deas finished seventh in the World Cup skeleton racing event in Igls, Austria.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deas, 28, went from 12th at halfway and could have won bronze from her second run if it was taken in isolation.
She recorded a time of 54.22 seconds in her second run - almost half a second quicker than her time from Run 1.
Her seventh-placed finish sees her stay in seventh in the global standings ahead of the World Championships in Konigssee, Germany later this month.
Elsewhere, Olympic champion Lizzy Yarnold did not compete as she was having a pre-planned rest weekend, while Donna Creighton finished 16th in her first World Cup race of the season.
