Swansea City manager Garry Monk praised his side for coping with the "tension and anxiety" of the Liberty Stadium crowd to draw 2-2 with Bournemouth.

Boos rang around the ground as the Swans fell 2-0 behind, before they recovered to claim a point.
But with just one win in nine Premier League matches, Monk acknowledges he and his players are under pressure.
"Tremendous credit goes to them for coming from two goals down to get the equaliser," he said.
"I think it showed the spirit within the squad and their work ethic.
"Having gone two goals down added to the tension and anxiety in the crowd. That then affects the players a little bit."
Monk's future has been under scrutiny lately and, prior to this match, the 36-year-old defiantly refuted reports he was facing the sack.
Although the Swans stay 14th in the Premier League table and five points above the relegation zone, Monk insists he is not concerned about his own position.
"It's not about me. I'm not the important one here. The important ones are the players," he added.
"It's trying to help them get back to winning ways, give them confidence and that will be done by results.
"You could see clearly how much the players wanted to put it right. It didn't go to plan but I have to give the players massive credit.
"They could have just capitulated or let that affect them. I thought they did well to come back."
Having trailed 2-0 to goals from Joshua King and Dan Gosling, Swansea equalised through Andre Ayew's backheel and a penalty from Jonjo Shelvey which Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe described as "contentious".
Cherries defender Simon Francis was adjudged to have tripped Ayew, though replays suggested the Ghanaian forward might have fallen over his own feet.
"Simon felt it was not a penalty," said Howe.
"Simon admitted there was contact with Ayew but felt he tripped over his own feet. Something about it did not look right."
Monk, however, believes referee Andre Marriner made the correct decision.
"The defender does clip, clearly clips Andre," he said.
"Whether that's intentional or not is debatable but he definitely tripped Andre up so the referee decided that was a penalty."
