World number one Dustin Johnson clawed back a five-shot deficit before beating fellow American Jordan Spieth at the first sudden-death hole to win the Northern Trust Open.

Johnson forced the play-off by sinking a 17-foot putt at the final hole, with both men finishing on 13 under par.
The world number one's ball caught the edge of the hole and did a half-circle around the lip before toppling in.
"I feel the game's back in form like it was leading into he Masters," he said.
"I'm swinging really well, got a lot of control over the golf ball and I'm feeling really good.
"Getting a win here gives me a lot of confidence going into next week and the rest of the play-offs."
The tournament was the first of four lucrative PGA Tour FedEx play-offs and it was Johnson's first win since missing the first major of the season at Augusta in April after falling downstairs.
He carded a closing four-under-par round of 66 at Glen Oaks Country Club, New York, while Spieth - who had led by three shots overnight - shot a 69.
Spieth's two birdies in the first five holes had seen him lead Johnson by five shots, before a double-bogey at the sixth hole after finding the water.
That left him three shots clear - and four holes later the pair were tied.
At the first play-off hole, Johnson knocked his approach to three feet and holed the birdie putt after Spieth had missed from distance.
The pair finished four strokes clear of Spain's Jon Rahm and Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas.
"I didn't lose this tournament. He won it," Spieth said.
