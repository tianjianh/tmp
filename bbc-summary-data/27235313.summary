A 200-year-old flood-hit bridge in Powys will be replaced by a new crossing and work to build it could start in late 2016.

Transport Minister Edwina Hart said plans were to build a new bridge over the River Dyfi in Machynlleth.
Campaigners have long complained that residents face a 20-mile (32km) detour when the Dyfi bridge is closed by floods or damaged by vehicles
Montgomeryshire AM Russell George said local people would be pleased.
The Dyfi bridge is seen as an essential link between north Wales and Aberystwyth but the crossing on the A487 has been repeatedly damaged over the years and is sometimes shut during periods of heavy rain.
In a letter to assembly members, Mrs Hart said: "Procurement of a team to deliver this project will commence next month.
"We will then develop the options and take the scheme through the statutory process.
"Construction could commence in late 2016 assuming a public local inquiry is not required."
Mr George said: "Local residents will be pleased to hear this latest confirmation."
"The bridge is a key pinch point in mid Wales's transport network and the sooner these challenges can be alleviated, the better for residents as well as both local and regional businesses."
Part of a side wall was knocked down by a lorry in 2010 forcing the closure of the bridge to trucks for several weeks.
