Horsemeat scandal: Dutch trader in court

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dutch meat trader has gone on trial for allegedly selling 300 tonnes of horsemeat as beef, during one of Europe's largest food scandals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Willy Selten denies intentionally tampering with beef consignments from his factory in the city of Oss.
Mr Selten appeared in court on Tuesday in Den Bosch accused of falsifying documents.
About 50,000 tonnes of meat was recalled across Europe during the horsemeat scare in 2013.
Mr Selten's wholesale business, Willy Selten BV, was raided by the Dutch food safety authority and he was subsequently arrested.
Prosecutors allege the firm's accounts show horsemeat was processed as beef.
Mr Selten admitted horsemeat was processed at the plant, and said some mistakes may have been made due to poor storage controls.
But he told Dutch news agency ANP that he did not knowingly sell horsemeat as beef and said he believed he would be acquitted.
The company was declared bankrupt in April.
On Monday a slaughterhouse boss manager in England became the first person to be sentenced in connection with the horsemeat scandal.
Peter Boddy, 65, was fined Â£8,000 (â‚¬10,800) after admitting one count of failing to abide by EU meat traceability regulations.
