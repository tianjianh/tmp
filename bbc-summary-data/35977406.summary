The 26-year-old will join the Championship side as a free agent on a three-year deal on 1 July.
Lowe previously worked with Terriers boss David Wagner when the pair were at Borussia Dortmund.
"He is also a great character; a leader in the dressing room, who has captained the team," 44-year-old Wagner told the club website.
