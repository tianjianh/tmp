St Pauls street carnival in Bristol cancelled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bristol's St Pauls street carnival has been cancelled, due to "ongoing challenges" faced by organisers.

A spokesman said there would be a small indoor event in September, but no large-scale street event.
The annual carnival, which is a celebration of the city's Afro-Caribbean culture, dates to the 1960s and normally takes place in July.
It is one of the biggest of its kind in Europe, with tens of thousands of people attending last year.
Earlier this year it was announced it had been postponed until September, also due to "ongoing challenges".
Festival organiser Cleo Lake said "unforeseen challenges and setbacks" had led to the decision to cancel the street carnival this year.
She denied it was because of a lack of funds, but said the event had "grown significantly" and was "getting more and more expensive every year" to stage.
A carnival spokesperson said: "We thank everyone who has supported us over our nearly 50 years of existence.
"We ask for your continued support as we realign the organisation and build towards a carnival event that has participation, engagement, talent development, opportunities and the best arts and culture at its centre."
This year's lower-key event will take place at the Malcolm X Centre on 5 September, and will include arts workshops, music, dance and a variety show.
The carnival is funded by Arts Council England and Bristol City Council.
