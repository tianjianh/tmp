Raiders had apparently rammed a travel agents before driving a Jaguar car through the window of the clothes shop.
The pair, aged 31 and 24, were arrested in Shirehampton on Thursday on suspicion of handling stolen goods.
Police said a large amount of property had also been recovered from a property in the Shirehampton area.
The men remain in custody for questioning, a Avon and Somerset Police spokesman said.
Avon and Somerset Police said the property recovered was thought to have been stolen in the burglary at Garment Quarter in Penn Street, in the early hours of Wednesday.
CCTV footage showed the raiders reversing the car into the travel agents' shop before realising their mistake and using the car to smash the window of the neighbouring store.
