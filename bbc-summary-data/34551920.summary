[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chemotherapy medicines are recalled in Republic of Ireland as a precaution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A number of chemotherapy medicines have been recalled in the Republic of Ireland as a precautionary measure.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Health Products Regulatory Authority said that an issue had been identified by the manufacturer of the drugs using a test product.
However, it emphasised that the test product was not a medicine and that it had not been given to patients.
RTÃ‰ reports that the authority said the contaminant was only found in a single unit of the product and that this did not necessarily mean that the medicine itself had been affected.
In a statement, the Health Service Executive said patients had been contacted by their hospital and offered an appointment as soon as possible.
None of the medicines have been supplied to Northern Ireland.
