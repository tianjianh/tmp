England midfielder Eric Dier says Spain's Ander Herrera caught him in the face with a "ridiculous" elbow during the 2-2 draw at Wembley on Tuesday.

England led 2-0 through Adam Lallana and Jamie Vardy, before Iago Aspas and Isco strikes levelled late on.
Tottenham's Dier, 22, chased Herrera following the clash to remonstrate with the Manchester United midfielder.
"I don't mind people kicking each other at times and stuff but that's just dirty and not needed," said Dier.
"He's elbowed me in the face and I just can't see why. For me, it's just ridiculous.
"He's saying he didn't do it, but I think it's pretty clear. It's just football. These things happen. But I don't know why he did it, to be honest. That's why I was angry."
Tottenham visit Manchester United in the Premier League on 11 December and Dier added: "I don't need him to apologise. I'll see him soon."
