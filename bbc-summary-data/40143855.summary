Lee McCulloch: Kilmarnock ready to appoint former Scotland striker as manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee McCulloch will be confirmed as the manager of Kilmarnock at the beginning of next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
McCulloch, 39, has been in interim charge since the departure of Lee Clark, and steered the club clear of a relegation battle.
The former Rangers and Scotland player is expected to sign a three-year contract at Rugby Park.
Killie start their 2017-18 season with League Cup first-round group fixtures in July.
They have been drawn in Group E with Annan Athletic, Ayr United, Clyde and Dumbarton.
After a playing career that took in spells at Motherwell and Wigan Athletic and resulted in 18 international caps, McCulloch joined Kilmarnock as part of manager Gary Locke's backroom team in 2015.
When Locke left Rugby Park in early 2016, McCulloch was in charge of the first team for two games until Clark was appointed.
Clark left for Bury in February and McCulloch guided Killie through their remaining 14 games of the season, winning four and drawing four.
Since Jim Jefferies' near eight-year spell in charge at Rugby Park ended in 2010, Kilmarnock have had seven different managers, including McCulloch.
In recent weeks, Kirsten Callaghan has been appointed as the club's new chief executive and former chairman Michael Johnston has resigned from his positions as a director and the company secretary.
