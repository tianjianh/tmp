About 12,000 people attended Saturday's Ar Waith Ar Daith (Work On Tour) performance in Cardiff Bay.
Walk the Plank's production involved dance, aerial artistry, storytelling and pyrotechnics.
Before the performance, two slate plaques will were unveiled.
The plaques had been engraved with poetic lines created by two school pupils, Charlotte Hunt from Harlech, Gwynedd, and Lena Mikulova from Cardiff.
School pupils from across Wales were invited to come up with their own verse for the plaques on the theme of what it means to be Welsh or living in Wales, taking inspiration from the words by poet Gwyneth Lewis which are on the front of the centre.
