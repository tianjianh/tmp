[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Queen of the South fans have approached Dumfries and Galloway Council to back their bid for a place on the board of the Scottish Championship club.

The Queens Trust needs the support of the local authority to meet share levels needed to take the issue to the Doonhamers' annual general meeting.
Their goal is to secure a director's role at the Dumfries club.
Failing that they have said they would hope to get a "non-voting representative" onto the board.
The Queens Trust has just over 900 shares in the Palmerston Park outfit with 7,500 needed to allow it to add an item to the AGM agenda.
It has written to Dumfries and Galloway Council to seek the backing of the Dumfries Common Good Fund which holds more than 6,600 shares.
Together they could ensure the issue of fan representation on the board was added to the agenda.
It would then be up to shareholders to decide whether the move should go ahead.
A statement from the club said: "Supporters having a say in the running of clubs is a fast-growing thing across Britain.
"Should the Queens Trust gain enough backing to have the subject added to the agenda for the AGM, then of course it is something that can be discussed.
"Successful or not, although it's not something we have at Palmerston, our door is always open and we encourage supporters, be it individuals or groups, like the Queens Trust to share their thoughts with us as we believe an open and honest dialogue is important between the club and its supporters."
