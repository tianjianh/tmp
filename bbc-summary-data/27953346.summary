Nahid Almanea was found with 16 stab wounds on a path near Avon Way, Colchester, on Tuesday.
Essex Police said a 19-year-old from Colchester had been arrested on Friday afternoon over the death.
He was also questioned about an attack on a woman who was jogging on Peache Road but police said he would face "no further action" in either inquiry.
Ms Almanea, 31, of Woodrow Way, was killed as she walked to the University of Essex on Tuesday morning.
She had been in the UK for less than a year and was taking an English language course as part of her studies for a life sciences PhD.
An Essex Police spokesman said: "No further action against him is planned in respect of either the murder or the assault as he has been eliminated from both inquiries."
Police had been investigating whether Ms Almanea was targeted because of her Muslim religion, but said there were other possible motives for the attack.
Ms Almanea was wearing a Muslim abaya robe and a multi-coloured hijab headscarf when she was killed.
CCTV images of Ms Almanea's last movements have been issued in the hope of encouraging witnesses. A picture of the bag she was carrying and a map of the route she was likely to have walked have also been released.
The University of Essex said Ms Almanea was a "very hard-working and conscientious" student and was due to finish her studies in August.
A 52-year-old man previously arrested over the death has been "positively eliminated" from police inquiries.
