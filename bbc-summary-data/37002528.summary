The Met Office has a yellow "be aware" warning in place covering most of the country for Sunday, with winds expected to increase in some parts.
Forecasters said gusts of 50 to 60mph were expected over the far north and north-west and could reach between 40 and 50mph in other areas.
On higher ground, a gust of 103mph was recorded on the top of the Cairngorms.
On South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, a gust of 56mph was recorded, with 55mph recorded in Aultbea in the north-west Highlands.
Wind speeds have reached 53mph in Loch Glascarnoch, near Garve in the Highlands, and 46mph in Leuchars, Fife.
Wind warnings or restrictions have been put in place on bridges, including the A90 Forth Road Bridge, A87 Skye Bridge and A92 Tay Road Bridge.
The weather has also disrupted CalMac ferry sailings on the west coast, with some services cancelled or suspended.
The unseasonably windy weather also resulted in a historic boat, which was due to show at the Johnshaven Fish Festival in Aberdeenshire, being blown over.
The Reaper, which is one of the few of its kind to remain seagoing, was left partially submerged at Johnshaven Harbour.
Forecasters had said that while the expected gusts were not exceptional for some areas of the country, increased outdoor activity at this time of year meant there was a greater risk of disruption.
They said that the windy conditions were due to a relatively deep area of low pressure moving slowly eastwards between Scotland and Iceland.
The Met Office said: "The strongest winds are expected to be across northern and north-western Scotland, but some locally strong gusts are still possible even across south-eastern Scotland, particularly over and to the lee of hills.
"These strong winds will also generate very rough sea conditions near north and north-west Scotland."
Yellow "be aware" warnings from the Met Office are expected to remain in force until 23:55 on Sunday.
