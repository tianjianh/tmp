[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tommy Mattinson, from Aspatria, retained his title as World Gurning Champion, claiming his 16th triumph.
The event is a highlight of the Egremont Crab Fair and involves hopefuls pulling an ugly face through a horse collar or "braffin".
Mr Mattinson, adopted his trademark expression, described as a "cross between an alien and a wolf man".
The crab fair, which dates back to Medieval times, also features traditional sports such as Cumberland wrestling, and a pipe smoking competition.
