The fan was given emergency medical treatment including CPR at the scene but Atlanta police later confirmed his death.
The man fell close to the where the players' wives and families sit and many could be seen in tears.
Police said the man was in his early 60s but they have not named him.
A security guard said the man appeared to be hanging on to a wire but then fell on to the lower seats during the seventh inning.
An Atlanta Braves statement read: "We have received confirmation that the fan involved in an accident at this evening's game has passed away. The Atlanta Braves offer their deepest condolences to the family."
Spectator Greg Shiver told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he had told his son to watch Yankees batter Alex Rodriguez come to the plate when he heard a thud.
"I saw a guy falling from the top. I grabbed my son and ran for security," he said.
Another fan died in a fall in 2013 at Turner Field that was later ruled to be a suicide.
