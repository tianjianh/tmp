Mid UK Recycling worker shredder death accidental

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man killed in an industrial shredder died accidentally, an inquest has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karlis Pavasars, 55, had to be identified by DNA from his toothbrush after he died at Mid UK Recycling near Grantham, Lincolnshire, in 2013.
The jury heard while the exact circumstances of the accident were unclear, Mr Pavasars was seen lying motionless on a moving conveyer belt.
A Health and Safety Executive (HSE) investigation is under way.
Father-of-two Mr Pavasars, of Peterborough, was working at the company in Barkston Heath, which shreds household waste into pellet-sized fuel for the cement industry.
Earlier, the inquest heard Dr Dominic Swan, of the HSE, say the death was due to a lack of guarding around a conveyer leading to the shredder.
Body fragments were found alongside a boot and parts of a hi-vis jacket inside the machine.
Counsel representing Mr Pavasars' family conveyed his wife's thanks to the coroner and the jury.
It is understood that there is to be a civil action for damages against Mid UK Recycling.
