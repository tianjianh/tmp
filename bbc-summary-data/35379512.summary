Damage was caused to a number of properties in the incident.
Residents have said it is the second fire in four weeks and they have blamed young people engaging in anti-social behaviour in the area.
Sinn Fein councillor Colly Kelly said the incident could have resulted in fatalities.
"Everyone in the area is sick to their stomach of this kind of behaviour.
"The residents have been going through this nightmare for at least six months."
Leanne Friel lives beside where the bin shed was set on fire and she said she doesn't feel safe in her home anymore.
"I go the two children out of the house and they were then having to stand in the cold.
The police said that they do not believe that the incident was suspicious.
"My son is petrified and he seen the fire himself. I want to leave my house now."
