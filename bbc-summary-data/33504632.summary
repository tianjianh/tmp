A40 Oxfordshire: £38m plan to cut congestion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost £40m has been earmarked to help alleviate congestion on the A40 in Oxfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £38m scheme as part of a package of works totalling more than £100m, has been recommended for approval by the county council's cabinet.
Proposals include a bus priority scheme on the approach to Swinford Toll Bridge and a new park and ride near Eynsham.
The authority described the investment as "an important leap forward" in its plans.
It said the majority of the work would be paid for through Local Growth Fund grant from central government, with developer contributions making up the rest of the available finance.
Other proposals include an eastbound bus lane between Eynsham roundabout and the Duke's Cut, Wolvercote, and a westbound priority bus lane on the approaches to Cassington traffic signals and Eynsham roundabout.
Council leader Ian Hudspeth said: "New bus lanes and a park and ride will make a significant difference and I am greatly looking forward to seeing work start and even more so to the day when users of the A40 can reap the benefits of these changes."
The cabinet will discuss the plans on 21 July, when it will also be asked to give the green light to a public consultation, to take place this autumn, to debate the options for a longer-term solution for the A40.
Mr Hudspeth said "solutions" to A40 congestion would require "ambition and creativity" and said the council wanted to hear the views of local residents.
"Should we seek to bring back West Oxfordshire's link to the national rail network? Ought we to be considering light rail? Would bus lanes be the best solution? Or would 'dualling' the entire route be the favoured option of local people?" he asked.
