North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) said the call in Levenshulme on Tuesday was "given the highest priority" based on the caller's answers.
But the paramedic sent in a rapid response vehicle found the patient to be a dog suffering from heat exhaustion.
The service described it as a "blatant misuse of the 999 number".
NWAS said the caller told the medic he had called 999 because he did not know what else to do and "knew the ambulance service would arrive quickly".
The paramedic told colleagues he "rushed through busy traffic to be greeted by a man and his dog" and described the incident as "a complete waste of time".
Steve Hynes, head of service for Greater Manchester at NWAS, said the caller "deceived the emergency services by claiming he was a friend of a male, rather than the owner of a dog".
Mr Hynes said: "We understand that dogs are like part of the family, but this incident is a blatant misuse of the 999 number."
He added that a person with a serious or life-threatening condition could have waited longer than necessary for help because of the call.
Of the 1,200 emergency calls received in the Greater Manchester area on Tuesday, 54% did not require treatment at an emergency department.
