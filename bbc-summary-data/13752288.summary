Mother hopes to donate womb to her daughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 56-year-old says she hopes to become the first woman to have her womb transplanted into her daughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eva Ottoson who lives in Nottinghamshire has agreed to take part in the medical procedure that would see her donate her uterus.
Her 25-year-old daughter, Sara, who lives in Sweden, was born without reproductive organs.
If successful she could become pregnant and carry her child in the same womb that she herself was carried in.
The mother and daughter hope the procedure could happen in Sweden next spring.
The pair have undergone tests to ascertain their suitability for the transplant operation.
Sara Ottoson was born without a uterus because of the condition Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.
Her mother, who moved to England from Sweden three years ago, said: "From the start when we realised what her condition was she [Sara] has always been talking about adoption.
"Then this opportunity came along last autumn.
"So I think there are loads of young women out there, who for one reason or another, can't get their own babies and if this could be some way of doing it in the future, why not?
"Both me and my daughter are rational about it.
"It's just an organ like a kidney or whatever. She needs it, I have it. I don't need it anymore.
"I can't see the ethical problems about it really."
The only previous womb transplant widely reported occurred in 2000, in Saudi Arabia.
A womb from a 46-year-old was given to a 26-year-old but it had to be removed 99 days later because of complications.
