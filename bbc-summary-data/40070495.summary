After rain wiped out the morning session, Glamorgan batted after Durham's first innings score of 342.
Jacques Rudolph made 31 from 15 balls before he edged Chris Rushworth to Paul Collingwood at second slip.
Glamorgan were struggling on 119-5 before Cooke (63*) and Donald (51) helped them to 225-6 at stumps.
When Donald was caught by Keaton Jennings off the bowling of James Weighell the hosts were 161-6, but Cooke then found an able partner in Andrew Salter through to the close.
Cooke told BBC Sport: "They're important runs for the team and it's important that I stay there for the tail.
"I'm happy to be contributing positively to the side and I'll be doing my utmost to get through the first session tomorrow.
"We'll take it step by step and try and edge our way up to their score. Hopefully we can still get a positive result."
