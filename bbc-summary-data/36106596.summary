Jamie Vardy is one of a quartet of players from league leaders Leicester, while Premier League top scorer Harry Kane is one of four men from Spurs.
Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil, a PFA Player of the Year nominee, misses out.
Women's Super League 1 champions Chelsea have three players in the WSL 1 Team of the Year.
The PFA had planned to reveal the team at its annual awards ceremony on Sunday but said it was forced to publish early because the details were leaked.
It blamed a member of the public for choosing "to deliberately leak our representative teams from the official brochure of the awards evening".
The players' representative body added: "As a matter of urgency, we are seeking a detailed explanation from the brochure printers as to how they were able to secure a copy of the publication."
Kane has scored 24 league goals this season for Tottenham, who are five points behind Leicester with four games remaining.
As well as Vardy, Wes Morgan, N'Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez are included from Leicester while Toby Alderweireld, Danny Rose and Dele Alli join Kane from Tottenham.
Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea, Arsenal full-back Hector Bellerin and West Ham's Dimitri Payet make up the rest of the team.
