New maps by software analysts Esri UK show Edinburgh tops the list with 49% green space.
Glasgow's total of 32% placed it second in the league table - ahead of Bristol (29%), Birmingham (24.6) and Greater London (23%).
Liverpool was shown to have the least, with only just over a sixth of its land classified as green space.
