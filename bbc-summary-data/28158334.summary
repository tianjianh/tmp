Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal approval confirmed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The government has given its final approval for a Â£1bn expansion of the Daventry freight terminal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The owners want to build a new rail interchange and warehousing covering 850 acres (345 hectares).
The Department for Transport has granted full development consent for the project, following a public inquiry which finished in June.
It means all related planning applications can now be dealt with solely by Daventry District Council.
The Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (Dirft) III project is the third phase of the transport hub, which began with phase I in 1997.
Developers claim the expansion will create up to 8,000 jobs.
The developers Prologis will now begin preparing the Rugby Radio Station site as planning applications for the individual elements of the development are submitted to Daventry District Council.
Phase I and II next to junction 18 of the M1 are in Crick, while phase III will be to the north in Rugby.
Jim Goodger, vice chairman of Crick Parish Council, said: "We had concerns about construction traffic and noise, but we always accepted Phase III would take place.
"We've asked for extensions to the Crick by-pass and widening of the canal bridge, but we're waiting for the local planning authorities to ensure we get the local infrastructure we need to mitigate the development."
Chris Over, councillor for economic development at Daventry District Council, said: "It'll provide a boost for the local economy and, while it will mean some disruption, it's a logistical operation par excellence.
"We want to ensure we get high tech industry in our town and this underpins our ambitions."
Prologis said it aimed to have the first buildings ready for use by the end of 2016, while the full redevelopment of the site would take place over 20 years.
