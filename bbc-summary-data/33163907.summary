UKIP's Farage challenges EU trade 'myths'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nigel Farage has challenged five "myths" about what would happen to Britain's economy if it left the EU.

The UKIP leader is launching a pamphlet later in what is being seen as an attempt to kill off pro-EU arguments ahead of the referendum campaign.
Mr Farage says he would be willing to lead the "No" campaign but he said a non-political figure would be better.
Pro-EU campaigners say UKIP's arguments for leaving have no basis in economic facts.
In its pamphlet, The Truth About Trade Beyond The EU, UKIP argues that Britain does not need to be in the EU to have access to the single market and to export successfully.
It also argues that the UK would not be isolated if it left and could negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU without signing up to "free movement" rules.
UKIP's trade spokesman William Dartmouth also angrily rebutted claims that leaving the EU would cost three million jobs.
"It is a deceit and people should stop peddling it. The facts simply don't support it," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
He said countries such as Switzerland and China exported successfully without being a member of a trading bloc and most British businesses did not trade with the EU but still had to abide by its rules.
"All the trade would continue and the trade is not dependent on there being a free trade agreement in any case," he told Today.
But Lucy Thomas, campaign director for the pro-EU campaign group Business for New Europe, said UKIP's arguments did not add up.
"There is no explanation of why we should leave. We currently have the best of all worlds. We export almost 50% to the rest of the EU and there are no barriers, no tariffs, it's all really straightforward and so I am not sure why we would want to take a risk and leave that.
"There is no guarantee at all about what kind of standards there would be, what kind of tariffs and actually once we were to vote to leave we would have no say on the deal the rest of the EU decided to give us."
Nigel Farage has, meanwhile, said he plans to be "extremely active" in the campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the forthcoming referendum and would be willing to lead it.
But he added that it would be better if it was "somebody from the world of business or entertainment who hasn't got any political baggage at all".
He told LBC radio: "I am sure someone like that will emerge."
