Battle of Orgreave: Inquiry decision expected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Campaigners demanding a public inquiry into the so-called Battle of Orgreave during the miners' strike are expecting an announcement from the government.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Home Secretary Amber Rudd is thought to have said she will decide by the end of October whether to launch a probe into police conduct on the day.
Thousands of miners and police clashed at the Yorkshire coking site in 1984.
Campaigners say South Yorkshire Police officers were excessively heavy-handed and manufactured statements.

Barbara Jackson, secretary of Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign, said: "We trust that Amber Rudd will announce the only right decision, namely that there must be an inquiry into what happened at Orgreave and after it. These events are too serious to let them lie."
Ms Jackson said the group had "real concerns", however, about what sort of inquiry would be established.
Momentum for an Orgreave inquiry has escalated since the conclusion of the two-year Hillsborough inquests, which provided a scathing assessment of the under-fire police force's behaviour.
