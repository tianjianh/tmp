Patrick Adams jailed for shooting 'grass'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A member of a notorious crime family who shot an associate he suspected of being a "grass" has been jailed for nine years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Patrick "Patsy" Adams, 60, of Finsbury, north London, shot Paul Tiernan, 54, in the chest in December 2013.
Woolwich Crown Court heard that Adams fled to the Netherlands with his wife before being extradited back to the UK.
Adams is the younger brother of Terry Adams, supposed head of the Clerkenwell crime syndicate.
The family is known to some as the A-team.
'A-Team' exploits
CCTV showed Patrick Adams walking towards a car in Clerkenwell and then fleeing the scene with his wife Constance just moments after a gun was fired.
Mr Tiernan had originally held the gun, which Adams wrestled from him after "fearing for his safety and that of his wife", the court heard.
James Scobie QC, defending, said the shooting was "out of character" and Adams accepted his actions were "not reasonable".
Mr Tiernan was found lying in the road near his car by officers.
It is thought he has made a full recovery but refused to co-operate with the police investigation.
As a result, all charges against Constance were dropped and Adams admitted the lesser charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He had previously been charged with attempted murder.
Mr Scobie told the court the pair's relationship had deteriorated because it had been suggested Mr Tiernan was a police informant and was trying to "ensnare" Adams.
He said his client had fled abroad because he was in "fear of retribution" and believed he would not get a fair trial.
Sentencing, Judge Kinch praised Adams for pleading guilty and said he had heard positive testimony in spite of his previous convictions.
"I have heard you are a father, grandfather and devoted husband," he said.
A third charge against Adams of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life will lie on file.
