[SN]TITLE[SN]
Naked gardener Robert Jenner cleared of all charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A naked gardener who was accused of causing alarm and distress by carrying out chores and DIY tasks without his clothes has been cleared of 11 public order offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Robert Jenner, from Eccles in Kent, was found not guilty of all charges after a two-day trial at Maidstone Magistrates' Court.
The court was told his naturism was "perfectly legal".
Mr Jenner had denied 13 charges, two of which were dropped.
The prosecution had alleged he was an exhibitionist and not a naturist.
Witness Fred Black told magistrates he was disgusted: "There's kids walking up and down that street 24/7. People don't want to see that. It's not right."
But Mr Jenner's defence team said he believed his behaviour to have been reasonable - a freedom of expression.
Alex Davey, for the defence, said Mr Jenner was not "flaunting his nakedness".
Ms Davey said: "It is not illegal per se to be naked in public. Naturism is perfectly lawful and is considered a freedom of expression."
She argued just because some people might feel surprised or uncomfortable, that did not make Mr Jenner's behaviour disorderly, nor did it make it a crime.
The prosecution had alleged this was repeated behaviour over a period of time, and witnesses were harassed, alarmed or distressed.
