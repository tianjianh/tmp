Charges of common assault against a Leicestershire county councillor have been dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillor Tony Kershaw was suspended from the Conservative Group in May with a trial expected to take place in December.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the case had been discontinued in light of new evidence.
Mr Kershaw, who has represented Quorn and Barrow for 12 years, has now been readmitted to the party.
He is currently chairman of the council's environment and transport scrutiny committee and had previously sat as the cabinet member for waste.
A spokesman for the CPS said "further information, some of which was provided by the defence, came to light which has caused us to review the original decision to prosecute".
Conservative party leader Nick Rushton said he was looking forward to welcoming Mr Kershaw back to County Hall to resume his duties.
