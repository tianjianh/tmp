[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher Hanmer, who taught at Garth County Primary School at Trevor, near Llangollen, allowed Year 5 and 6 pupils to change math test answers in 2013.
He also submitted inflated reading results to the Welsh government, an Education Workforce Council hearing was told on Tuesday in Flintshire.
The panel said the unprofessional conduct was "cheating".
The actions came to light in 2014 when the school's acting head teacher compared results from 2014 and the higher marks for tests in 2013.
The EWC committee, sitting at Ewloe, heard Mr Hanmer allowed pupils to correct their own answers to the numeracy tests.
The panel also heard eight pupils sitting the national literacy tests had their marks increased - one pupil by ten points.
Mr Hanmer told the hearing he could not understand how the inflated literacy scores came to be presented to the Welsh government, which sets national reading and maths tests for all school pupils in Wales at key educational stages.
But the EWC panel's chairman, Martin Jones, said the teacher had inflated literacy scores to "reflect better on himself".
"This was cheating. It's a very bad example for a teacher to set. He gave the pupils an unfair advantage over others," he said.
"Integrity in the exam process is very important and once it is undermined it is very difficult to rebuild."
The teacher, who had already been suspended from his post, said he had been under great stress at the time because a family member had died and another was unwell, but he could not explain why he had falsified the results.
Mr Hanmer was told he would be able to appeal against being removed from the teaching register in five years' time.
