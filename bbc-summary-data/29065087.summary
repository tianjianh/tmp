Colchester United: Tony Humes persists with youth 'philosophy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Colchester United boss Tony Humes has insisted the club's reliance on youth will continue.

The U's have cut their wage budget in favour of directing funds towards the academy, which Humes managed until replacing Joe Dunne as boss this week.
Colchester have yet to win a game this season, but five academy products have featured for the side in that time.
"That's the philosophy of the club, to continue to bring young players through. That won't change," he said.
"I would imagine that's one of the reasons I've been put in the role, because of my knowledge of what is coming through the system. I won't be afraid to put them in."
Macauley Bonne, Alex Gilbey, Frankie Kent, Sammie Szmodics and Drey Wright were all given first-team chances this term by Dunne, who left the club by mutual consent on Monday.
Defender Tosin Olufemi broke into the senior side last term, but he suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in the summer.
Former Ipswich and Wrexham defender Humes, 48, arrived at Colchester as head of youth in 2009 and will take charge of his first game as manager against Walsall on Saturday.
"It's something I've never done before. I'm sure there will be nerves and excitement," he said.
"We want to implement what we've done over the last few days."
