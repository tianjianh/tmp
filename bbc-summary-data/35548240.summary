Dublin Luas tram two-day strike begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thousands of people who use the Luas tram service in Dublin are facing disruption as a two-day strike begins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Workers from the Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (Siptu) have stopped work for 48 hours in a dispute over pay.
The red and green Luas lines are not operating on Thursday and Friday. It is estimated that 90,000 customers will be affected each day.
A further two-day stoppage has been scheduled for next week.
The union is seeking pay rises averaging at 40% for members.
Siptu's Owen Reidy said they were open to negotiation and to spreading the rise over a period up to seven years.
The union said its members believe they are underpaid, particularly when compared to workers doing similar jobs in Irish Rail.
However, Transdev, the private company that operates the Luas, has described the claim as excessive, saying they lost 700,000 euros (Â£551,000) last year.
Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe told Irish state broadcaster, RTÃ‰, on Wednesday that major efforts had been made to avert a strike.
He urged both sides to return to the labour court and called for reasonable negotiations.
