[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hounslow teacher banned over bestiality images

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former assistant head who admitted viewing images of bestiality has been banned from teaching for two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Kingston, 38, of Hertfordshire, resigned from St Lawrence Roman Catholic Primary in Hounslow in 2014.
A National College for Teaching conduct panel heard he admitted having viewed images depicting bestiality.
He was found not guilty of expressing a sexual interest in children online after the panel heard it was "unclear" who had made the posts.
Mr Kingston, who began work at the school in 2002, told the panel he had not actively searched for images depicting sexual activity involving a person and an animal.
"I did not actively access these images," he said, "but simply tolerated them upon being shown to me."
It was, he told the panel, his partner at the time who had searched for the images.
However, the panel's recommendation that he not face a prohibition order was overturned by the secretary of state.
While the panel said Mr Kingston was "a passive participant" and the incident "did not involve any pupils" the secretary of state found the panel had "not taken sufficient account of the public concern" the case would arouse.
A two-year ban was imposed.
