Beck, 26, made his debut for the region in 2007, becoming their youngest player, a record he still holds.
The seven-cap centre has been out of action since damaging his ACL in the opening weekend of the Pro12.
"It's been a tough year for me but the good thing is that, fingers crossed, I'm raring to go and excited about getting back into action," he said.
"We've got a really young group at the moment, that's one thing that stands out for me.
"There's so much exciting talent coming through the ranks, it's really exciting to be a part of the squad at the moment and I'm looking forward to getting back out there and competing for a place."
"Ashley is someone who is Osprey to the core, who has immense pride in representing his home region, and who has gained enormous experience despite still being a young man whose best days are ahead of him," said Ospreys coach Steve Tandy.
"His talent on a rugby field is clear and obvious to anyone who watches him.
"He's had a pretty frustrating time with injury lately but his selfless attitude has been fantastic, contributing to the environment on a daily basis, driving high standards from the rest of the group.
"The challenge he faces now as he approaches fitness again is to get himself up to speed and try and force his way back into the starting fifteen.
"With his positive attitude, he's the kind of player who will thrive on that challenge which is great news for the Ospreys."
