A former nursery worker raped a boy and tried to blackmail other teenage boys into taking part in sex acts, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jamie Chapman, who has also worked as a teaching assistant and sports coach, tricked the teenage boys into sending him naked images of themselves.
The 28-year-old from Solihull, West Midlands, has admitted rape and 21 offences of causing or inciting sexual activity with children.
He will be sentenced on Tuesday.
Birmingham Crown Court heard he duped 18 victims in all, with the offences taking place between 2011 and 2016.
He created fake Facebook personas of teenage girls and would use them to get boys to send him naked images.
The boys would then be urged to engage in sex acts and, if they they refused, he would blackmail them by threatening to send their photos to their friends or family.
Prosecutor Matthew Brook said Chapman's aims were to get the boys to send him naked pictures so he could blackmail them, and then to encourage them to meet up with a boy and, ultimately, to meet up with himself.
One blackmail victim agreed to meet a boy, who turned out to be Chapman.
Chapman, of Tamar Drive, raped him and filmed it on the boy's phone.
Police traced Chapman through internet addresses he left behind when logging into his fake profiles.
He is part-way through being sentenced and has also pleaded guilty to nine counts of taking, making and distributing indecent photos of children.
