Leaflets from Birmingham City Council were given to buskers on Saturday banning them from the High Street, New Street, and four city squares.
The decision was taken after "a significant increase in footfall" on previous weekends, the council said.
Its statement said "crowd control measures" were used for "the continued safety of buskers and the public".
A spokesman said this was a "one-day restriction" but the option to introduce a ban on future dates "remains open".
Buskers were still allowed to perform in other parts of the city centre on Saturday, the council said.
Network Rail said Birmingham New Street station has been "exceptionally busy" at times during the run up to Christmas.
"On Saturday 6 December, 206,000 people used the station - that represents an additional 70,000 people compared to an average day," a spokeswoman said.
Almost five million people travelled to Birmingham last year during the period of the Frankfurt Christmas Market, council figures showed.
