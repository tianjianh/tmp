Wales defender Ben Davies admits he is surprised Joe Ledley has recovered from a fractured leg in time for Saturday's Euro 2016 opener against Slovakia.

Midfielder Ledley suffered the injury during Crystal Palace's Premier League win against Stoke City on 7 May.
But the 29-year-old has taken part in full training this week and is likely to feature at some point in Bordeaux.
"It's a quick one [recovery]. But it's credit to him and credit to the physio staff," Tottenham's Davies said.
"They must have worked tirelessly to get him where he is now. And hopefully he'll be able to last the whole tournament."
Ledley has won 61 caps since making his debut against Poland in 2005 and was a key member in the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign, starting seven games.
Former Swansea City left-back Davies says that the bearded ex-Cardiff City and Celtic midfielder also plays an important role off the pitch.
"He's a big character in the dressing room," added 23-year-old Davies. "He's somebody that can lift somebody at all times. He's great to have around the dressing room."
Midfielder Joe Allen and striker Hal Robson-Kanu have also returned to full training with the squad at their base in Dinard this week.
It means every member of Chris Coleman's 23-man squad are fit and available for the start of the tournament on Saturday.
"It's a massive boost. To have a full squad of fit players is something that the manager is going to want," Davies said.
"And we've got that going into the first game."
