Edinburgh Fringe: Walking the tightrope on artistic freedom

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
At the Edinburgh Fringe, it is not only comedians who play with political correctness.

Walking the Tightrope is a show featuring eight short plays exploring freedom of expression within the arts, followed by a panel discussion which includes audience participation.
The production, which includes work by Caryl Churchill, Neil LaBute and Timberlake Wertenbaker, is causing levels of outrage that any comedian would envy.
LaBute wrote his play, Exhibit A, in response to Exhibit B - a live art installation about black slavery which was well received by critics at last year's Edinburgh International Festival but was cancelled by the Barbican due to claims of racism.
In Exhibit A, a black man rapes a white woman in the name of art, in front of a complicit audience, while a crowd protests outside.
Actor Syrus Lowe, who plays the rapist, said: "I am sure there are people who felt Exhibit B shouldn't have been closed down, but then after seeing my piece would rethink that because they might be offended by that.
"Some people feel that Neil often writes pieces that are misogynistic. Some people shout out. We have had people leave.
"The rape wasn't an issue for me because I though that the concept of putting something out there and saying where's your line, what do you call art, where do you draw the line, was really interesting."
The other plays include Beyond the Fringe by Tim Fountain, which features a woman boycotting a show funded by the Israeli government. However, her son is going to the show dressed as a golliwog to make his point that being politically correct is futile.
After the plays are over, there is a 30-minute panel discussion with audience participation. The panel changes daily and, along with the audience, they are asked which play affects them the most.
On Wednesday, the panel will include Edinburgh International Festival director Fergus Linehan, along with former director Jonathan Mills.
On the day I visited, some younger audience members said Beyond the Fringe resonated the most with their experience.
Meanwhile, one woman in the audience said the rape scene in Exhibit A was misogynistic and reminded her about memories of domestic violence rather than art.
The panellists included Iain Macwhirter of the Sunday Herald, who said that despite his reaction to the rape scene, his view remains that art must be allowed freedom of expression if it is to say anything useful about society.
He said: "Art has to be offensive. If it's not offending somebody it's probably not good art.
"The creative imagination has to be free to explore all these aspects of human existence."
It could be that there is an air of preaching to the converted about this show, as the audience is a self-selected group whop seem to share similar views on freedom of expression.
In the end it raises more questions than it answers but I think that is what it intended to do.
