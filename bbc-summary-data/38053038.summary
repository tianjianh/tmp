Economic advice shake-up expected following Brexit vote

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A shake-up of more than 40 organisations which advise the Welsh Government on economic development is planned, BBC Wales understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Economy Secretary Ken Skates wants to streamline the system as part of a wider review into Wales' economic priorities in the wake of the Brexit vote.
Ministers get advice from a number of different panels and trade bodies.
The Welsh Government said it was looking at "the range of advice given".
Industry sources said part of the problem with the way the structure has developed is that there are now too many different organisations operating in economic development.
The organisations vary from nine panels, made up of representatives from the private sector, advising ministers on individual sectors, to specialist trade bodies like Industry Wales, which represents the automotive, aerospace and electronic manufacturing industries.
Ministers also receive advice from eight boards representing enterprise zones across Wales, as well as regional skills partnerships.
Many of the advisory bodies were created by Mr Skates' predecessor Edwina Hart.
It is understood the Welsh Government wants to simplify the structure of the advisory boards and avoid duplication with the work carried out by civil servants in the economy department.
A spokesperson said: "We are currently working on refreshing our economic priorities so we can continue to build a fairer, more prosperous, and more secure Wales.
"As part of that work we are considering the range of economic advice currently given to the Economy Secretary by sector panels and expert bodies and groups.
"The Cabinet Secretary has been clear that he wishes to streamline current arrangements and develop new competitiveness plans to drive up productivity in the Welsh economy."
