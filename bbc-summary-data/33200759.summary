Lawrence Fairbairn was delivering letters in Peebles when he heard the faint cries of help coming from the woman's flat.
He discovered her in great distress and quickly called an ambulance.
The 61-year-old has now been invited to the Queen's garden party at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in recognition of his actions.
Mr Fairbairn said: "I was delivering mail to a block of flats on a Tuesday in April, when I heard faint cries for help.
"I pushed open a door and discovered a lady who had been stuck in her bath for three days.
"She was very cold, dehydrated and frightened.
"I didn't get far inside before I could see the lady through the bathroom door.
"I didn't go any further - to preserve her decency - but she told me she had been in there since Saturday and it was now Tuesday morning."
He said the woman told him she had a problem with her back and was unable to get out of the bath.
He called for an ambulance and waited with the woman until paramedics arrived.
Andrew Ebner, Peebles delivery office manager, said he is proud of Mr Fairbairn, who has been a postman for 15 years.
"His actions demonstrate exactly why our postmen and women are such highly valued members of their local communities," he added.
A Royal Mail spokeswoman also paid tribute. She said:"This lady was very cold and Lawrence was an absolute hero coming to her rescue.
"As a business we put forward people who are deserving of recognition - and we were delighted to nominate Lawrence for the Queen's garden party."
He will be among 8,000 guests at the annual garden party on 1 July.
