Nottinghamshire batsman Taylor, 25, stands in for regular captain Eoin Morgan, who is playing for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League.
Yorkshire bowler Tim Bresnan is recalled, with six potential ODI debutants in an initial 11-man party.
More players will be added following selection for the third Test against West Indies on Friday.
One man on the tour of the Caribbean definitely included is wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow, but James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Joe Root, Ian Bell and Moeen Ali are set to be rested.
Morgan has been given permission to miss the game against the country of his birth in order to fulfil his IPL contract.
Hampshire batsman James Vince, Kent wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings, Somerset all-rounder Lewis Gregory, Northants all-rounder David Willey and Surrey pair Zafar Ansari and Jason Roy, a spin-bowling all-rounder and opening batsman respectively, could make their ODI debuts.
The one-off game is England's first limited-overs match since being eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup in New Zealand and Australia last month.
"It is a new era," Taylor said. "Hopefully it is the start of good times ahead for English cricket."
Taylor, who made his debut in the same fixture four years ago, was recalled to the England team on their tour of Sri Lanka in December and has played in all of their ODIs since.
In 17 matches, he has made 492 runs at an average of 35.14, with a highest score of 98 not out, made against Australia in England's opening match of the World Cup.
"To be given the opportunity to lead your country is a huge honour," said Taylor, who has captained Notts' limited-overs teams and the England Lions. "It's going to be brilliant leading an England team in a one-day international."
Taylor has scored a combined total of 26 on his two previous games in Ireland.
Speaking to BBC Radio Nottingham after scoring an unbeaten 53 on the third day of Notts' County Championship game at Hampshire, Taylor added: "I would like to say it is a nice place for me but things have not gone so well for me  in the two games I have played out there.
"Hopefully this game will be different. I know it will be special leading out the boys on that day but hopefully I can get a few runs as well and lead my side to victory."
Ireland recalled bowler Tim Murtagh to their squad for the match at Malahide Cricket Club near Dublin, where captain William Porterfield is set to make his 200th international appearance.
