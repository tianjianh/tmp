They include dresses worn by actresses Maggie Smith and Michelle Dockery as well as a dinner service suit worn by actor Jim Carter.
The exhibition, which runs until September, features a total of 21 pieces from the show.
Jemma Conway, collections officer at Cannon Hall Museum, said: "People love Downton and the costumes look fantastic in our period rooms.
"We want people to really enjoy looking around the house as well as being able to soak up the atmosphere of Downton.
"It's amazing to see the costumes and imagine yourself living in that time."
As well as the outfits worn by the Dowager Countess, Lady Crawley and Carson the butler, people will also be able to see Cousin Matthew's cricket whites and Mrs Patmore's cook's uniform.
Cannon Hall was home to the Spencer-Stanhope family for more than 200 years and is set in 70 acres of parkland at Cawthorne.
