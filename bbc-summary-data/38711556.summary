India v England: Ben Stokes stars at Eden Gardens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England held on to win the third one-day international against India by five runs as Ben Stokes found redemption at Eden Gardens.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stokes, hit for four successive sixes in Kolkata in the World T20 final loss, struck a 39-ball 57 in England's 321-8.
He removed key man Virat Kohli and ended a 104-run stand between Kedar Jadhav and Hardik Pandya.
Jadhav remained with India needing 16 from the final over, but Chris Woakes had him caught for 90.
Not only did it give England a first international win on the tour after a 4-0 defeat in the Tests, but also just a fourth success in 26 ODIs in India.
India take the series 2-1, with the first of three Twenty20 internationals in Kanpur on Thursday.
Stokes' previous game in Kolkata ended with him slumped on the Eden Gardens turf after being clubbed for four maximums by West Indies' Carlos Brathwaite.
This return was a heroic one as he energised the end of England's innings with the bat and then took vital wickets with the ball.
England looked set to fall short of a competitive total at 246-6 after 43 overs, only for left-hander Stokes, using his feet and targeting the mid-on area, to blast a 34-ball half-century.
Master run-chaser Kohli was dropped at fine leg on 35 by Jake Ball and looked likely to make England pay before Stokes induced a wild drive and an edge behind.
And when India looked to have reversed the momentum, Stokes returned to bowl the 46th and 48th overs, conceding only seven runs, bowling Pandya and having Ravichandran Ashwin caught at mid-on.
In an incredible chase of 351 to win the first one-day international, right-hander Jadhav destroyed England with 120 from 76 balls.
Whereas then he was guided by captain Kohli, here he was forced to do the bulk of the work, first in the company of Pandya, who rode his luck for 56 in a century partnership that came in less than 14 overs.
Short of stature, Jadhav played cuts and pulls, and although wickets fell around him he looked on course to seal a remarkable victory as England's bowling got ragged, perhaps because of a dew-affected, slippery ball.
In the World T20 final, England were defending 19 off the final over. Here, Jadhav threatened to pull off something equally astounding:
On placid pitches in the the first two ODIs, England made scores of 350-7 and 366-8 only to lose both.
Here they were more comfortable on a surface that offered movement and bounce for the pace bowlers.
Still, a weakness of losing wickets at key moments and batsmen failing to convert good starts was repeated.
Jason Roy got into a tangle to be bowled by Ravindra Jadeja for 65, captain Eoin Morgan helped a long hop to short fine leg for 43 and Jonny Bairstow cut to point for 56 - both men victims of the excellent Pandya's 3-49.
Stokes' late hitting took England to a competitive score and their pace bowlers enjoyed the greater assistance to run through the India top order, even after David Willey was forced from the field with a shoulder injury.
Then came the charge of Jadhav and Pandya, but Stokes and Woakes, who earlier added 73 with the bat in only 40 balls, had the final say.
Simon Hughes on Test Match Special
There wasn't any shame in losing those first two games. There was nothing in it for the England bowlers and they came up against some fantastic Indian batting.
Here, there was more in the pitch for England and they exploited it very well.
The Champions Trophy will have these kind of pitches and England look better suited when the ball does a little bit.
Man of the match Ben Stokes: "It was difficult when we came here last time. I put it down to good captaincy to get my overs out of the way before the last over!
"It was difficult at the start of my innings. The ball was doing a bit so I gave myself as much time as I could. Woakesy played a good part in that as well.
"It has been fantastic to be a part of the series. Thankfully we got a win."
England coach Trevor Bayliss: "We've been playing some good cricket, scoring a lot of runs and we felt we deserved a win.
"On this ground, I'm sure there were some memories. It sums up Ben Stokes that he was able to get over it and bowl very well."
England captain Eoin Morgan: "It has been hard work - a competitive series. It was tough for the bowlers. We were rewarded for our persistence and drive to get a result. We fought hard against a really good side."
India captain Virat Kohli: "It's been a series of a lot of positives. We almost got over the line today and we were getting excited to see two of our younger guys showing character lower down the order. I'm very pleased."
