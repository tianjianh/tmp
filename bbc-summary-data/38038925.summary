Stockton special educational needs changes planned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Services for young people with special educational needs and disabilities are to be revamped, a council has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stockton Borough Council is considering plans to make support and intervention available earlier and nearer to home.
The new system would mean children attending a school near where they live rather than travelling to specialist placements, the council said.
Cabinet member Ann McCoy said it wanted them "to have the very best chance of reaching their full potential in life".
She said: "We have already spent a lot of time talking to schools across the borough and now we are keen to hear from anyone who has an interest in these services so we can listen to and consider everyone's views before a final decision is made."
The council wants to concentrate other provision such as occupational and speech and language therapy into hubs in central, south and north Stockton.
It is consulting on the changes.
No child would need to move from an existing placement because of the changes, it said.
