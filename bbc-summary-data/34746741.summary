The "weeping window" was first put on display last year at the Tower of London, with those flowers now draped down St George's Hall.
The exhibition is part of a tour of the poppies across the UK which will last until 2018 before they become permanently based at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.
This time-lapse footage shows how the display in Liverpool was put together.
