Gorka Marquez needed dental surgery after two of his lower jaw front teeth were badly chipped when he was attacked by a gang of youths in November, a Strictly spokesman said at the time.
Mr Marquez did not make a formal complaint to police about the incident.
Lancashire Police said the force had checked CCTV from the area in Blackpool and found nothing.
A spokesman said the force had "carried out a proportionate investigation which is now closed" and "no arrests" were made.
The programme's makers said it was up to Marquez or his representatives to comment on the closure of the investigation.
Speaking at the time of the alleged assault, a Strictly spokesman said the 26-year-old Spaniard was in the Lancashire resort for a live edition of the show when he was the victim of an "unprovoked incident".
Mr Marquez was reportedly on his way to a nightclub with colleagues after filming the show's annual broadcast from Blackpool Tower Ballroom.
He was said to have been getting out of a car when a "random group of lads" ran past and assaulted him.
Mr Marquez tweeted his fans after the incident saying it was "a bad experience" but he was "feeling better".
The dancer made his Strictly debut in this year's series and had been partnering EastEnders actress Tameka Empson, who plays Kim Fox in the BBC soap.
They were eliminated in the second round but he has continued to appear in the programme as part of the weekly group routines.
Mr Marquez also stepped in to dance with singer Anastacia in week five when her partner Brendan Cole was ill.
He represented Spain at the World Latin Championships in 2010 and has toured internationally with stage show Burn the Floor, according to his biography on the BBC website.
Mr Marquez will appear as part of the group routines on Saturday's grand final show when the winner of the glitter ball trophy will be chosen.
