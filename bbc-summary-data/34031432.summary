Russell Slade: First victory will 'lift' Cardiff City, says manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Russell Slade believes Cardiff's first league win of the season against Wolves can lift the team's confidence after a turbulent previous season.

Criticised by fans last term, Slade entered this campaign under pressure, and the Bluebirds drew their first three games.
But a 2-0 win against Wolves came as a relief to Slade.
"Everybody thought I would be down the road by the end of August, I suspect," he said.
"The pressure was on to deliver at homeâ€¦ and we've managed to do that.
"We're in quite a good place. I see us making progress.
"It was important we got our first win and it will build confidence."
Goals from Kenwyne Jones and Sammy Ameobi helped Cardiff to a comfortable win against a Wolves side who narrowly missed out on the Championship play-offs last season.
Slade succeeded Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as Bluebirds manager in October 2014 and, after a torrid spell around Christmas when Cardiff fans called for Slade's sacking, the former Leyton Orient boss eventually steered his new side to an 11th-placed finish.
Now in his first full campaign in charge, Slade is encouraged with the progress Cardiff are making.
"It is important to get your first win but, performance-wise, I've been fairly satisfied with what we've produced by and large," he added.
"In open play, teams are not causing us problems perhaps like they were last year. We're more organised.
"We're playing off a structure and it's how I want to play now."
