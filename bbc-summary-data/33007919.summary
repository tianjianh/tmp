Joanne Kelly and Simon Jones took their case to the High Court over comments made about the use of Tasers after they subdued a man they had arrested.
In a BBC interview, Assistant Chief Constable Andrew Ward failed to make clear they had successfully challenged their dismissal for gross misconduct.
A solicitor said his inaccurate statements caused "significant damage".
Jeremy Clarke-Williams, representing Ms Kelly and Mr Jones, told Mr Justice Nicol "they now understand that ACC Ward says he did not intend to convey those statements about them".
The judge was told the constables were on duty in a marked van in 2009 when another officer saw Kyle McArdle urinating in an alleyway in public view.
When they spoke to Mr McArdle, there was a confrontation which led to him being arrested and taken into the van.
Mr Clarke-Williams said: "The officers contend that once in the van, Mr McArdle assaulted both Simon Jones and Joanne Kelly, necessitating the use of their Tasers to subdue him. Mr McArdle alleged that he was the victim of unwarranted treatment by the police."
The two officers faced a misconduct panel hearing in 2013 and were subsequently dismissed.
Last year, an independent police appeals tribunal ordered their reinstatement.
About a month later, when Mr Ward was asked in a BBC Radio Merseyside interview about the use of Tasers by the force, the interviewer referred to the sacking of two officers.
Mr Clarke-Williams said the senior officer did not make clear that the pair had been reinstated and instead stated that his force "would not tolerate inappropriate use of Tasers".
"By doing so, he suggested not only that Joanne Kelly and Simon Jones remained sacked from the force but also that their case was a prime example of conduct which Merseyside Police would not tolerate," he said.
He added: "These inaccurate statements caused very significant damage, distress and embarrassment... and they felt greatly injured and betrayed by them".
Counsel Hannah Ready said Chief Constable Sir Jon Murphy offered his sincere regrets for the embarrassment and distress caused. The allegations were also retracted.
The court heard both officers retired on medical grounds in March and had received letters from the force thanking them for their distinguished and committed service.
