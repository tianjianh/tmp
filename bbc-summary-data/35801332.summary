Oxadixyl, which was used to control potato blight between 1991 and 2003, was found in routine tests.
Helier Smith, chief executive, said: "Mains water is safe for consumers and the current situation presents no risk to public health."
Pesticides Metribuzin and Linuronn were found at Val de la Mare reservoir, but this is not used by Jersey Water.
Ms Smith said: "It is not unusual for us to occasionally identify pesticides in stream water. In these instances, it is standard practice for us to take that stream out of service until the substance has disappeared.
"What is unusual with Oxadixyl is that it is still present even though it hasn't been used in Jersey for 13 years. We'll need to look at other ways of removing it through treatment."
Minister Steve Luce said he would consider bringing in measures to regulate pesticide use.
He said: "These test results are unacceptable, and I think the time has come to consider tougher measures."
Mr Luce added the public could be assured "public water is clean and safely within EU guideline drinking water limits".
