Paul Hurst: Shrewsbury Town manager says players must earn new contracts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town manager Paul Hurst has warned his players there could be as many departures as additions as he rebuilds his relegation-battling League One squad during the January window.

"They know where my office is," he told BBC Shropshire. "But, even if they've been really good, nobody has done enough yet to warrant another deal.
"If I give answers they want, great. If I can't, they must keep working hard.
"We can at least have a chat. But it's about the group, not individuals."
Since coming in on 24 October, Hurst has already offloaded Antoni Sarcevic, and opted not to extend the loans of George Waring, Ivan Toney and Sylvan Ebanks-Blake.
Having led his team out of the bottom four for the first time in three months, the former Grimsby Town boss knows the importance of staying together as a squad if they are to avoid the drop.
He has already made three signings, in defender Aristote Nsiala, winger Alex Rodman and striker Freddie Ladapo. But, while he continues to chase new faces, he has told his players, especially the ones whose contracts expire in June, that they have to prove to him why they should be kept on.
Goalkeeper Mark Halstead, defender Mat Sadler and midfielders Abu Ogogo, Shaun Whalley and Ian Black are all out of contract at the end of the season.
And, although Ogogo and Sadler are still regulars, Halstead is currently second-choice, while Whalley was relegated to the bench for the 1-1 draw at Swindon last weekend and Black did not figure.
