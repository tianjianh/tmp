California fights drought, but parts of LA stay green

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
I've been in Los Angeles for just one day, but in driving around the swanky streets of Beverly Hills and Bel Air, I haven't seen much evidence of brown lawns or shrivelled flowers.

Even the golf course outside my Burbank hotel looks deliciously green. So, how much impact is a four-year-long historic drought having on water consumption in America's most populous state?
A new poll here reveals a very human reaction: "Yes, there's clearly a water shortage but I personally can't do much more to cut back."
The poll shows an overwhelming majority of Californians say that the water shortage is extremely serious, and they also support the governor's new stronger water consumption limits. But 44% of homeowners say they will find it hard to actually reduce their usage.
Interestingly, if you happen to be an anthropologist or a behavioural economist, wealthier households, who naturally consume more water to start with, say it will be even harder to cut back.
So, as we head into summer and these restrictions go into effect will those lawns and flower beds actually start to look a little less perfect?
