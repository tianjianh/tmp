Ennis-Hill, who received her honour from the Duke of Cambridge, will receive another World Championships gold medal after Tatyana Chernova was stripped of her 2011 world title for doping.
The 2012 Olympic champion, who was accompanied by her grandparents, mother Alison Powell and husband Andy Hill at the ceremony, said: "Just to hear the national anthem in this kind of moment again is really special.
"I've so many amazing memories of standing on the podium and hearing it and to be here receiving a damehood, which I never imagined I would ever receive, is an incredible honour."
She added: "I've had more than I could ever imagine out of my career so I can't stand here receiving a damehood and wish for any more."
