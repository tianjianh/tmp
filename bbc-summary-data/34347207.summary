[SN]TITLE[SN]
Closure of Caernarfon care home Y Frondeg discussed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care home in Gwynedd could be closed and replaced with a new Â£3.8m building.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gwynedd Council has opened a consultation on the proposed closure of Y Frondeg residential care home.
Under plans, it would be replaced with a new home on adjoining land in Caernarfon, which could house up to 16 residents and include specialist support for adults with complex needs.
Staff and residents from Y Frondeg would also move to the new home once it has been completed.
Cabinet member for care, Gareth Roberts, said: "We obviously accept that change can be difficult, but we are keen to ensure that living standards and facilities available for adults with a learning disability are of the highest standard."
The consultation runs until 23 October.
