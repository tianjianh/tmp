On Monday morning zookeepers found one Humboldt penguin lying dead in its cage and two others missing, police spokesman Marco Mueller said.
It is the latest in a string of mysterious incidents at Dortmund Zoo.
Last month a sea lion was found dead with a smashed skull. In August three pygmy marmosets were stolen.
Mr Mueller says it is not clear whether the incidents are linked.
Police are trying to determine whether the penguins were targeted by thieves.
A post-mortem examination is being carried out on the dead bird, the zoo said.
Security at the zoo has been stepped up.
