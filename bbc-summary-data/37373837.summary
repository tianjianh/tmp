[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Powys council trading company to run care homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new trading company could be set up by Powys council to run 12 residential care homes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council cabinet has agreed in principle to develop a company to run Bupa Care Ltd homes across the county, after its contract with Bupa expires in May 2017.
The council said the current model did not have the resources to "deliver the required levels of services".
It said it could help develop care services.
A spokesman for Bupa Care said: "We are proud of the high quality of care that we deliver in the 12 homes we operate in Powys, which we lease from the council.
"We were surprised to learn in the local media that the council may set up a company to run these homes after the current contract expires next May.
"No final decision has been made and the council will take the next few months to review arrangements and decide what to do next."
