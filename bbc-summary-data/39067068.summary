A campaign featuring giant bananas has been launched to get people to increase the food recycling rate by 50%.

Recycle for Wales, a Welsh Government grant-funded campaign, said although Wales already recycled half of its food waste and was "leading the UK", there was more to be done.
People will wear banana costumes at events starting Friday in Pontypridd.
The idea is to highlight how 240,000 tonnes of banana skins are being thrown away which could create energy.
One caddy of food waste produces enough energy to watch a football match on TV, Recycle for Wales said.
"When we ask people in Wales why they don't recycle their food waste, they tell us it's because they don't think they produce enough to bother," Angela Spitteri said.
"Unavoidable waste items, like tea bags, egg shells, potato peels and of course, banana skins aren't edible but can all be recycled."
Recycle for Wales said if all the household food waste which went to landfill was recycled, the methane could be turned into energy.
