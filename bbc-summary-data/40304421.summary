The 33-year-old Irishman was at Tayside rivals Dundee United as a youth and followed a spell in his home country with four years at McDiarmid Park.
He was recently youth team coach and community officer at Shamrock Rovers.
"I'm delighted to have Graham on board. He is someone I have known for a number of years and will be a great addition to club," said McCann.
"He knows Scottish football, has sound opinions on the game but, most importantly, he is a man who shares the same values and principles that I aim to instil into the team."
Earlier this month McCann, who had been working as interim boss, reversed his decision to leave Dens Park to take up the manager's position on a more permanent basis.
Blair Doughty, meanwhile, has joined the Dark Blues as the club's fitness coach after voluntary spells working with the Under-20s and the first-team squad.
