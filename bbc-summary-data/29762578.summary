Tweeting Queens and other social royals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Queen has tweeted.

Yes, we know she didn't properly tweet and instead just pressed "tweet" without writing her own text. It was someone called Chi who gave Her Majesty the iPad  - we tried to get hold of him but he wasn't available to talk to us because he's probably too busy tweeting.
The Queen signed off her first tweet with Elizabeth R. The "R" stands for Regina which is Latin for Queen.
Just over a week ago Prince Andrew, the Queen's son, told Newsbeat: "The palace has been tweeting for a lot longer than I have but I'm the only member of the family that is tweeting separately, apart from both of my daughters."
She's not the first head of state to tweet and we were wondering what's next for Her Majesty? Is she going to start Snapchatting while walking the corgis?
We decided to take a look at some of the other royals around the world and see what they're up to online:
Imagine if the Duchess of Cambridge took selfies in Kensington Palace. The Norwegian equivalent of Kate Middleton does just that and we like her for it.
The Queen of Jordan uses Instagram as well as Twitter. Queen Elizabeth has a lot of catching up to do.
The Greek royals aren't proper royals anymore because Greece is now a republic but they still get to call themselves Kings, Queens, Princes and Princesses.
Prince Andrew isn't the only member of the royal family on Twitter, his daughter is there too. We have a sneaky suspicion Harry is as well but Princess Beatrice didn't tag him...
