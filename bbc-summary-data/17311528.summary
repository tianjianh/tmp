The channel, called 4seven, will offer content from the previous seven days as an alternative to watching online.
The broadcaster said the channel - which will be available across all TV platforms - will be launched "later this year".
It is Channel 4's first new channel since it launched digital sister service More 4 in 2005.
"With so much choice out there, viewers are increasingly saying they sometimes just miss the best stuff, despite their PVR (personal video recorder) and VOD (video on demand)," David Abraham, Channel 4 chief executive, said.
"4seven will give viewers more chances to catch the most popular and talked about Channel 4 shows."
Mr Abraham added 4seven would schedule the main channel content that is "creating noise - amongst social media, bloggers and commentators".
However, it is understood Channel 4 is still in discussions with production companies to secure rights for shows to appear on the new channel.
Ithad been reportedVirgin Media were initially wary of a deal with the channel as it could provide direct competition to its own catch-up TV offering.
Although distribution deals have now been secured with the service provider along with Freeview and Sky, it is not yet known where 4seven will live on electronic programming guides.
