The Reverend Hilary Jowett, vicar of St Leonard's Church, said local residents were "horrified and shocked" at Leonne's death.
"But I think we've now accepted this has happened, horrible and awful though it is, and we are grieving for a teenager who should be living her life", she said.
A post-mortem examination revealed Ms Weeks had died from multiple stab wounds.
Shea Peter Heeley, 18, of Doe Quarry Lane, Dinnington, is to appear at Sheffield Crown Court on 17 February on suspicion of murder.
