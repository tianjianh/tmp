The incident happened in Milkstone Road shortly before 12:30 BST. Fourteen ambulances were sent to the scene.
One man in his 20s suffered a broken jaw and a woman was taken to hospital with serious facial injuries.
Twenty-five people were on board and managed to get off the vehicle, which was not on its usual route. The bus company has launched an investigation.
Paramedics treated passengers at the scene.
Greater Manchester Police said one person was taken to hospital with serious facial injuries.
Police said in a statement: "The roof of the bus was completely ripped off on impact. There were approximately 25 passengers on the bus at the time and 17 people have been treated at the scene for minor injuries."
Insp Stephen Clarke said: "Clearly there are lots of people in shock, but luckily no one was trapped on the bus. Our investigation into the cause of the collision is ongoing and we would encourage anyone with information to get in touch."
First Buses said the number 17 bus was not on its usual route from Manchester to Rochdale. It was about half-a-mile away from its usual route on Manchester Road.
Teresa Broxton, managing director of First Manchester said: "Our primary focus remains the support of our injured customers and our driver. We will continue to offer our help to all those affected by this serious incident.
"We have launched an immediate investigation into the cause of the incident and will work closely with the emergency services as part of that work."
A company spokesman said the female bus driver, who joined the company in June, was "in shock" but uninjured.
Eyewitness Mohammed Waqas said: "I was walking down the road when I just saw the bus crash with bridge. [sic]
"Really bad, people really hurt, some people crying."
He added: "Even I saw the driver, she was crying, and after a few minutes the police come and move the people away."
Network Rail said its engineers are on site working to resolve the problem at the railway bridge and the company apologised to customers for the disruption.
The scene is still sealed off at the moment although the remains of the double-decker, the mangled wreckage, has been taken away on a low loader.
The bus struck the railway bridge close to Rochdale's main railway station just after 12.30 BST, where broken glass is still scattered over the road.
Scores of people rushed out to help the passengers on board.
A joint investigation is now under way with police and First Bus, which operates the service.
Eleven people are now being treated in hospital.
Sue Schofield works in a local pharmacy. She said: "They were in shock. They seemed quite calm, but obviously shaking in shock, some crying - they wanted some help basically. We got the people downstairs and off the bus."
Daisy Murphy was a passenger on the lower deck of the bus and said: "I was at the back at the bottom and I got flung forward down the aisle. Everyone got together and helped to get everyone off the bus. But it was so scary."
