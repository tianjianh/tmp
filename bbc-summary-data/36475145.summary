The 23-year-old was taking part in the squad's first session at their base in France when he suffered the injury.
"A decision on a new player has yet to be taken," said a Germany statement.
The absence Rudiger, who plays for Roma in Serie A, is a blow with fellow centre-back Mats Hummels not fully recovered from a leg muscle injury.
Germany had arrived at their tournament base in Evian only hours before Rudiger was injured.
They are in the same group as Northern Ireland, Poland and Ukraine.
