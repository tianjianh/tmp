Mrs Fitzgerald said she was "flabbergasted" to become a great-great-great grandmother.
"I cannot fathom how I have got all these generations, but anyway I am thrilled to bits," she said.
Her grandson Stephen Barley, 60, is Harvey's great-grandfather.
He said he was very "proud" of the family and all its generations.
"I cannot believe we have reached this milestone - six generations.
"We all love each other, we are all from Grimsby in the family, and I just think its good to have a nice story come out of the town."
