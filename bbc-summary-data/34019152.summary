Pride Glasgow is taking place over two days for the first time, with the annual parade through the city centre on Saturday.
This year the focus is on raising awareness of transgender rights.
Texas and Union J are among acts performing at a festival site on Glasgow Green.
The parade set off from the Green, with floats and walking groups from organisations including The Equality Network, The Gay Police Association and Dogs Trust making their way through the city centre.
A rally was also held on Glasgow Green ahead of the march.
It involved more than 100 community, charity and trading stalls offering advice and merchandise, a community stage with circus performances and live music, as well as a funfair and food and drinks stalls.
Alastair Smith, chief executive of Pride Glasgow, said: "This year marks 20 years of Pride Events in Scotland and we have come along way since the first.
"Pride is a chance for the LGBTI community and their friends, family and supporters to come together and celebrate the achievements of the community and to stand together as one and raise awareness of the issues that we still face."
