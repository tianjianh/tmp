[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour to run West Lothian Council as minority administration

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Labour minority administration is to run West Lothian Council - even though the SNP has more local councillors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the latest example of the largest local party being left in opposition.
Last week, a proposed coalition deal between Labour and the Conservatives in West Lothian was vetoed by the party's executive body.
Administrations have still to be formed in Edinburgh and Clackmannanshire.
