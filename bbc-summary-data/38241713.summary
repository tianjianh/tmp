The Daily Mail reported Cellino will be banned for 18 months and fined £250,000 for breaching football agent rules.
Cellino, 60, and the club have already been charged over the sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham in August 2014.
If the Italian is banned, it will be the third time since he took over the Championship club in April 2014.
The newspaper report also stated that the club will be fined a further £250,000, in addition to the punishment imposed on Cellino.
"I am surprised to read the news regarding the FA's intentions to ban and fine me, as well as fine the club," Cellino said in a statement on the club's website.
"I am not guilty and I will take the right steps to defend myself through the tribunal.
"I feel that I am guilty of one thing - protecting Leeds United since I took charge of the club."
