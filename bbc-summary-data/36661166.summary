Anne Hidalgo said they will be given the Medal of the City of Paris.
The medal, known as the Grand Vermeil, is regarded as Paris' most prestigious honour and has been awarded to a variety of cultural and political figures.
Both teams reached the knockout stages but exited Euro 2016 last weekend.
"They participated in the festive atmosphere that has been prevailing in Paris these last two weeks," said Jean-Fran√ßois Martins, deputy mayor for sport and tourism.
"They are a model for all the supporters of the world.
"As shown in the numerous videos that circulate on the social networks, the Parisians particularly appreciated meeting them, speaking with them and sharing those joyful moments that are essential in such a great sportive event."
Ms Hidalgo has written to First Minister Arlene Foster and Irish President Michael D Higgins to inform them of the award, but it is not yet known when the ceremony will take place.
Northern Ireland lost 1-0 to Wales on Saturday while the Republic of Ireland were beaten 2-1 by France on Sunday.
