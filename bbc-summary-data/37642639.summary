Rohan Beyts, 62, said she had to "answer the call of nature" at sand dunes after walking on the beach near the Menie resort in April.
She was told staff had filmed her, and was reported to the procurator fiscal.
Mrs Beyts said she was "relieved" at the Crown Office news. Trump Golf Scotland expressed surprise.
Mrs Beyts said she was now pursuing a civil action for being filmed.
The retired social worker told the BBC Scotland news website she was "absolutely relieved" and said: "All the way along I have felt this has been a nonsense. I did not do anything wrong.
"I had no option when I needed to answer the call of nature.
"My friend turned round to give me a bit of privacy and we joked we hoped the were no CCTV cameras.
"When I discovered men had been filming me I felt really uncomfortable - mortified.
"It's ironic they said my act was disgusting but you hear about Donald Trump's claims about women. I know which I think are disgusting.
"If this had involved any other golf course no-one would have been interested.
"I feel totally vindicated."
A Crown Office spokesperson confirmed: "Following a review of all facts and circumstances the case, including new evidence which has come to light, the procurator fiscal instructed there be no proceedings."
Sarah Malone, of Trump Golf Scotland, said: "It's surprising that someone causing a nuisance and urinating in public is not prosecuted but this is a matter for the police and the procurator fiscal.
"She has absolutely no case against us and the claims made are baseless, untrue and quite frankly ridiculous.
"We will continue to rigorously defend our business from activists and troublemakers like this."
Mr Trump opened his Menie course in July 2012 after lengthy opposition from local residents and environmentalists.
The course, which is owned by Trump International Golf Club Scotland, lost just under Â£1.1m in 2015.
