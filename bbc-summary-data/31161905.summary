Saido Berahino was put "on the naughty chair" by his West Brom manager Tony Pulis after the striker said that "he hoped to move on to bigger things".

The 21-year-old made the comments in an interview with Sky Sports News that had not been authorised by the club.
"For Saido, the most important thing is to go out there and perform, rather than talking about it. He's still got a long way to go." said Pulis.

"If he gets to that stage, he'll have teams coming after him."
The former Stoke City and Crystal Palace manager added: "He's not had that yet, as there were no phone calls asking for him in this transfer window."
"The kid has been at this football club since he was 10. He has got real respect for the people who have helped him get to where he's got so far.
"The question is, does he want to go on and play in a top four team?
"I've no doubt he does, but his responsibility is to work as hard as he can for us until that happens and to go out and score as many goals as he can until the end of the season."
West Brom, with new signing Darren Fletcher, travel to Burnley on Sunday, three points above the relegation zone, with Sean Dyche's side only a point clear of safety.
"The lads got straight into him for the interview, but it was all in good fun. He is young, he said something and he will learn from it. I know from being in the dressing room he loves West Brom and he wants to do well here."
"The manager sold the place to me. It wasn't until I came down here and saw the great facilities and met some of the great people involved in the club that I truly made my decision."
"I bounced a few things off him as he knows everything about everyone in the game. He always gives you sound advice and he reaffirms a few things in your mind. The decision is ultimately mine, but he's a great person to seek advice and ideas off."
"It's very similar in style. I've noticed the intensity in training is very good. After the first day, I thought: 'A few weeks of this and a few games under my belt and I'll be absolutely flying'. It's great, it's exciting for a player and I've really enjoyed it."
