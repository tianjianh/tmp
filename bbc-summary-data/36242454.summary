Barcelona deserve to be champions of Spain for the sixth time in eight seasons, says boss Luis Enrique.

Barca will be champions if they win at 16th-placed Granada or equal Real Madrid's result away at 13th-placed Deportivo La Coruna next Saturday.
"I hope we can be precise in the final game to win the title," said Enrique after a 5-0 derby win over Espanyol left Barca one point clear at the top.
"We're going to play for a league of 38 games in one match."
Real Madrid were 10 points behind leaders Barcelona on 1 April.
However, 11 straight La Liga wins, including Sunday's 3-2 success over Valencia, means Zinedine Zidane's side go into the final day one point behind.
They will secure their first La Liga title since 2012 if they win and Barcelona slip up. A Barcelona defeat and a Real draw will see Barca crowned champions as Luis Enrique's side have a superior head-to-head record.
"There will be tension, Real Madrid and ourselves are in the same situation of playing away from home and having to win," added Luis Enrique.
"The prize is there and it is attractive enough that we will all be very motivated."
Atletico Madrid started the penultimate weekend of the season level on points with Barca but a surprise 2-1 defeat away to relegated Levante means only Real Madrid can overhaul Barca.
"Now we're second there's only one game and anything can happen," said Real boss Zidane.
"You never know in football. We have to be aware of that and fight to the end."
