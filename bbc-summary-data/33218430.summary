A total number of 188,449 visitors were recorded - almost 10,000 higher than last year and 805 more than the previous record attendance at Ingliston in 2010.
This year more than 30,000 children attended the show for free.
The annual four-day event showcases Scottish farming, food and drink and rural living.
Visitors included Princess Anne, who is patron of the Royal Agricultural Society of the Commonwealth (RASC), First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead.
The show is Scotland's largest outdoor event, contributing an estimated Â£47.1m to the Scottish economy last year.
Stephen Hutt, chief executive of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland (RHASS), said: "Once again the Royal Highland Show has lived up to its reputation as one of Scotland's most enduring and iconic events.
"Along with being the place to experience the best of farming, food and rural life, it is also still very much the place to 'do business', with trade space selling out in record time this year."
