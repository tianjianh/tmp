[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former leader Gordon Matheson to leave Glasgow City Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former leader of Glasgow City Council, Gordon Matheson, is to leave the authority to become a visiting professor at Strathclyde University.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Matheson has served as a Labour councillor in the city for 17 years - five of those as leader.
He stepped down from the leadership last September and was replaced by Frank McAveety.
A by-election will be held for his Anderston/City ward, the date of which has yet to be confirmed.
Mr Matheson said: "As a cities man, I am delighted to accept this prestigious appointment which comes at a perfect time for me.
"Having served as a city leader I am fortunate to be in a position to still contribute to the development of international cities in a non-political capacity."
Mr Matheson will be a visiting professor at Strathclyde University's Institute for Future Cities - part of its economics department.
In his role he will be expected to write, lecture and assist with research projects across the UK and abroad.
The move appears to mark the end of Mr Matheson's political ambitions for the moment.
Last year he stood for the depute leadership of the Scottish Labour Party and came second in the first round of voting.
He later decided against putting himself forward as a possible Labour candidate for Holyrood.
