Rangers' Jordan Rossiter reveals debt to Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers

Jordan Rossiter says he has much for which to thank Celtic's Brendan Rodgers but will relish playing for Rangers against his former manager this season.

The midfielder was signed this summer from Liverpool, where he was handed his debut by Rodgers in September 2014.
"I owe him a lot," said the 19-year-old. "He brought me into the team at Liverpool and gave me a chance.
"I was only young at the time and learning my way, but now I'm looking forward to coming up against his side."
The pair are next likely to meet when the two Glasgow clubs renew their rivalry on 10 September at Celtic Park.
"Brendan has managed in the Premier League and is obviously a good coach," said Rossiter.
"He has got his way of playing, but we've got a good way of playing as well.
"It's going to be a good battle. It will be interesting."
Rossiter made only three starts and two substitute appearances during his time at Anfield.
And, although he impressed as he made his Rangers debut as a substitute in Monday's 3-0 Scottish League Cup win over Stranraer, the England Under-19 international stressed that he has much to do to establish himself in Mark Warburton's side.
"In training every day, I have to improve and I have a long way to go before I am a first-team regular," said Rossiter.
"Rangers are just as big a club as Liverpool and I want to come up here and try and get as many minutes as I can.
"Obviously I owe a lot to the gaffer here too. Mark has shown faith in me to bring me up here and I'm really looking forward to playing under him.
"We want to beat every team in this league, especially Celtic with them being Rangers' main rivals."
Having been taken under the wing of former Liverpool captain Steven Gerard at Anfield, Rossiter is looking to gleam more valuable lessons from fellow Rangers signings Joey Barton and Niko Kranjcar.
"Joey is a brilliant player," he added. "He has been great to me and really helped me out since I've been here.
"He has played at the top level for years and the likes of Kranjcar and also Andy Halliday can help me out and bring me on."
