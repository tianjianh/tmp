Man who punched girl freed from jail after court appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who punched a girl has been freed from jail because he was "under great stress" as his partner was terminally ill at the time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 11-year-old knocked on Lee Kilburn's door in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in July 2014 and ran away as part of a prank with friends.
But the 45-year-old chased her, grabbed her hair and dragged her to the ground before punching her twice in the face.
His one-year jail sentence was overturned at London's Appeal Court.
The girl had to undergo surgery to correct a deviated septum in her nose because of the attack, the court heard.
Kilburn, of Union Road, was imprisoned for a year at Bolton Crown Court in June after pleading guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm.
But three senior judges ruled he was punished too harshly and handed him a nine-month suspended sentence.
On the evening of the attack, the court heard, Kilburn had been informed his partner had terminal cancer and had been given just months to live by doctors.
Judge David Aubrey QC said: "He was operating under great stress. He was of good character, acting out of character and through a loss of self-control due to extraordinary stress."
Pointing to those "exceptional circumstances", he allowed Kilburn's appeal and release.
