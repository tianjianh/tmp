[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton beach smoking ban proposals considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Smoking could be banned on Brighton beach under plans being considered by the city council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The authority has said residents could be asked for their views on the proposals, which could also be extended to the city's parks.
A "voluntary" smoke-free scheme already exists in 42 of the city's children's playgrounds.
Brighton and Hove City Council is set to meet on Tuesday to decide whether the public consultation should proceed.
If agreed, it will run from the following day for 12 weeks.
