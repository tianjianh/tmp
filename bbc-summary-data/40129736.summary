The Irish News front page reads: "Republican group says it shot dead two men".
The paper reports that the paramilitary group, Action Against Drugs, says it was behind the killing of Dan Murray and Joe Reilly.
Dan Murray, 55, who was a take-away driver, was murdered in May 2016 while making a delivery on Lady Street near the Grosvenor Road in west Belfast.
Forty-three-year old Joe Reilly was gunned down in October of the same year at his home in Glenwood Court, Poleglass.
The group claiming the murders says both men were drug dealers.
According to the Irish News three other people were also targeted by the republican group in recent months and have been sent warnings to leave the country.
Meanwhile the News Letter marks the fortieth anniversary of the killing of three RUC men who were murdered by the IRA.
The families of Kenneth Norman Lynch, Samuel Derek Davidson and Hugh Henry Martin have said their loved ones "died as heroes".
The men's patrol car was struck by over 30 bullets at Carnon Cross near Ardboe, County Tyrone, in June 1977.
Two years after the killings a 22-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment, the paper reports.
The Belfast Telegraph leads with a mother's distress after her 12-year-old daughter was grabbed by a man on her way to school.
Heather McLean told the paper that her daughter, Molly, had just left her house in Hill Crest in Bangor when she noticed a man following her.
The young girl then sped up before the man grabbed her by the arm, but she was able to free herself and ran back to her house.
The man is reported to be in his 40s and was wearing a dark black or green hoodie.
Police are now investigating the incident.
The Daily Mirror reports that 10,000 people have lied about attending the Ariana Grande concert on the night of the Manchester bombing last Monday in order to gain tickets to a benefit concert.
It comes after the star promised attack survivors free tickets to the "One Love" concert due to be held in the city this weekend.
Tickets for the gig, which will be headlined by acts such as Coldplay, Take That and Katy Perry, sold out in minutes.
A Belfast bride who won online competitions to pay for her wedding also makes the front page of the Daily Mirror.
Claire Morton apparently spent two hours per day at her computer entering up to 10 competitions.
She told the paper that, as a result, she was able to marry her husband James without spending any of their own money.
The couple who met in 2012 spent their honeymoon in Orlando, Florida.
