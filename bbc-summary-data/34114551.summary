The swimming pool on Justice Mill Lane closed in 2008 because of local authority budget cuts.
Seven bidders have submitted proposals to Aberdeen City Council.
A recommendation the council holds talks with Bon Accord Heritage to investigate the option further was unanimously approved.
The group is hoping to raise about Â£15m.
The property sub committee agreed the head of land and property assets should start discussions with the group, and report back to the committee by 24 May next year.

Property sub committee convener Ross Thomson said: "The city council recognises that the community can play a huge role in shaping their local area and it is great to see so many volunteers taking an active interest in the future of the Bon Accord Baths site, which otherwise could have been lost to the city.
"These proposals could help breathe life back into a facility that was close to the hearts of many Aberdonians. We look forward to hearing how the plans will develop following detailed discussions with our officers."
The opening of the baths in 1940 was captured on film and can be seen on the National Library of Scotland's Screen Archive.
