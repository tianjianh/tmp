They are being presented Ushakov medals for their part in delivering supplies to the Eastern front.
Eleven veterans are receiving medals at a ceremony at Bodelwyddan Castle, Denbighshire, on Tuesday.
And 67 medals will be awarded at an event in Cardiff on Wednesday attended by First Minister Carwyn Jones.
Campaigners long believed veterans should have been able to receive the Russian accolade and in 2013 the UK government made an exception to its rules.
Referring to the veterans, Mr Jones said: "They not only fought enemy ships, U-Boats and airplanes, but also battled extreme weather, sailing with ship decks covered in ice in ferocious conditions of towering seas and hurricane force winds."
