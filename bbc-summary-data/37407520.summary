[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chris Rogers and James Hildreth made centuries before title-chasing Somerset collapsed on the opening day at Taunton against relegated Nottinghamshire.

They shared a partnership of 269 after England paceman Jake Ball removed both openers to leave the home side on 33-2.
Rogers hit 18 fours in his 132 before edging Ball to wicketkeeper Chris Read.
Hildreth, who had to bat with a runner, was taken at slip for 135 in the next over and Ball claimed 6-47 as Somerset slumped from 302-2 to 322-9 at stumps.
Somerset began the game in third place, 10 points behind Middlesex, but can win the title for the first time in their history providing the leaders do not beat second-placed Yorkshire in their game at Lord's.
The loss of wickets in the final session was costly as the task of scoring 78 in 13.2 overs on the second morning to collect all five batting bonus points looks beyond their final pair of Dom Bess and Jack Leach.
Ball bowled an impressive opening spell at the start of play and had Marcus Trescothick caught behind for 25 before Tom Abell chipped to mid-wicket in his next over.
He then struck Hildreth a painful blow on the ankle when he had made only seven, forcing the right-hander to call for a runner. But, there was no further breakthrough for Notts until their double success with the new ball.
They then dropped chances offered by Peter Trego and Lewis Gregory, although neither proved expensive as Somerset's lower order were unable to cope with the rejuvenated Notts attack. Five wickets went down for no runs after Gregory was bowled by Imran Tahir.
