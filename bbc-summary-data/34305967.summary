The injured man, who is in his 20s, was rescued by members of Arran Mountain Rescue Team who abseiled down a cliff at Catacol to reach him.
He was flown to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow by a Royal Navy helicopter. His injuries are "non-life threatening", police said.
The other male paraglider managed to land safely and was said to be well.
The collision between the two paragliders happened at about 16:00 on Saturday, sparking a huge rescue operation.
The Royal Navy helicopter from nearby Prestwick in Ayrshire was scrambled but crew decided that if they went in too close they could blow the victim off the cliff.
Instead, they collected the Arran Mountain Rescue team and dropped them off at the top of the cliff above the paraglider.
The scene of the crash is at the top of the island in the Firth of Clyde, about 16 miles north-west of Brodick, in a spot popular with paragliders. The accident happened in good weather.
Ryan Gray, of Belfast Coastguard, said the operation had been a "difficult multi-agency job".
"At 3.56pm, we received a report from Police Scotland about two paragliders who had been involved in a mid-air collision.
"One managed to land safely but the other crashed into the cliff. He was unconscious for a little while, hanging from the cliff by his wires.
"Due to the fact that he was hanging from his parachute, it was decided it was not a good idea for the helicopter to go in and try to winch him up. He could have been blown off the cliff."
