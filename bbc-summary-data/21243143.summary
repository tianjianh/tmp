Lucasfilm confirmed that Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones and Episode III - Revenge of the Sith would be delayed.
Last week Disney announced that Star Trek director JJ Abrams would direct the forthcoming movie, Episode VII.
The film is set for a 2015 release.
Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, from creator George Lucas last month for $4.06bn (Â£2.6bn).
Episode I - The Phantom Menace was released in 3D last February and earned $22.4m (Â£14.3m) in the US in its opening weekend.
The original prequels were released between 1999 and 2005.
Abrams directed the Star Trek reboot in 2009 and its upcoming sequel, Star Trek into Darkness, to be released May.
Lucas said he was the "ideal choice" to direct the the seventh movie in the series - due out in 2015 - adding "the legacy couldn't be in better hands".
It will be scripted by Oscar-winning writer Michael Arndt.
