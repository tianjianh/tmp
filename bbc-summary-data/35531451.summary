The theme, Building Better Worlds, focuses on how science, technology and engineering can transform the world and the way we live in it.
Festival officials said Scotland is a world leader in scientific research.
Venues across the capital will play host to more than 250 activities from 26 March to 10 April.
Among the highlights for adults, leading astrophysicist Lord Martin Rees will be joined by European Space Agency astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy and Prof Chris Rapley to share their views and experience on the big challenges of today's world.
To help mark Dolly the Sheep's 20th birthday, Prof Sir Ian Wilmut will discuss how the cutting-edge research continues to influence science developments.
Artist Warren Elsmore will create a Mars habitat display with Lego building blocks at the National Museum of Scotland.
Dame Evelyn Glennie will perform a new composition by composer Jill Jarman in the world premiere of The Sounds of Science.
And the City Art Centre will feature five floors of experiments and activities for children.
Amanda Tyndall, Edinburgh International Science Festival's creative director, said: "In 2016 Edinburgh International Science Festival asks: how can we all collaborate to help build a better world?
"It's a huge question but I'm excited by the mix of world-leading scientists, artists, authors and innovators that will join audiences in Edinburgh to share and debate their visions of a better world.
"Science and technology have the potential to help us address so many of the key challenges we face; from how we feed, heal and fuel the world to how we live happy and fulfilling lives as we do so."
She added: "But they don't work in isolation from the wider world. It is through collaboration with their creative cousins that we stand the best chance of innovating and securing our future.
"This year's Festival celebrates this with a programme focus on the fertile space where science meets the arts, with something for curious minds of all ages."
