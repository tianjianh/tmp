Carwyn Jones calls for more devolution plans for UK

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carwyn Jones has said all political parties should set out plans for more devolution next spring.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first minister, who backs a Scots No vote, said Wales should not be treated separately to Scotland, although it may not end up with the same powers.
He said he hoped for progress on Silk Commission's latest recommendations.
Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, who supports a Scottish Yes, said Mr Jones could not stand up for Wales' interests.
The so-called Silk Two report included a call to give the Welsh government responsibility for policing.
The first Silk Commission report paved the way for the Wales Bill, currently going through parliament.
The bill devolves some tax-varying powers to Cardiff, including the possibility of a referendum on whether Welsh ministers should be able to vary income tax rates.
Once the Scottish independence referendum is held on Thursday, Mr Jones told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales there was a "desperate need" for the nations to "sit down, get together and say 'Right, this is what we want the UK to look like in the 21st Century'".
"That hasn't happened up to now.
"What is on offer [to Scotland] should be offered to Wales. It's a matter then to judge what is best for Wales.
"But there's no reason why Wales should be treated separately to Scotland, particularly when it comes to the structure of devolution - that has to be the same in my view across the UK."
He said he wanted all political parties to lay out in their general election manifestos next year "what they propose to do in terms of taking forward part two of Silk".
There was no consultation before Gordon Brown laid out a timetable to devolve more power to Scotland in the event of a No vote, the first minister added.
"We saw that timetable and it was something that came as news to us," he said.
"But... we have our own timetable with the Wales Bill that's in parliament at the moment and, of course, we hope to see another timetable for the implementation of the powers that are mentioned in Silk two."
He added: "There's no doubt that my party has to look at Wales as well.
"Scotland is the issue in hand this week. I'm not surprised at that of course with the referendum on Thursday, but once that's over we need to see what powers should reside where - and that hasn't been done up until now."
He denied a claim by Alex Salmond that he would not campaign for a No vote unless the UK government agreed to devolve borrowing powers to fund a new stretch of the M4 around Newport.
Mr Jones said: "I did say to the prime minister it would be very difficult for me to go to Scotland with credibility if they didn't implement part one of Silk. I did say that, and that's important for Wales.
"How could I go to Scotland and argue for a No vote when the first question I'd be asked is 'Hang on a second, this is sitting with Whitehall at the moment, they've done nothing about it?'
"They did do something about it and it made it easier for me then... to put forward what I believe in, which is of course that Scotland should vote No."
Speaking on the same programme, Leanne Wood, who supports Scottish independence, said: "What we have in place at the moment is a very timid, risk-averse government which seems unable to influence matters and key figures in Westminster on this debate."
She added: "We've been a spectator nation in this debate for far too long now and we need to see, not a first minister... who is timid and unable to stand up for the interests of Wales against the elite establishment in Westminster.
"We need a government that can take these people on and make sure that Wales' voice is heard".
