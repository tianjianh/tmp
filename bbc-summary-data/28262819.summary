Minnie Snodgrass from Conisbrough, South Yorkshire, became wedged in the metal bucket which her mother Gemma had been using.
She was rescued unharmed by fire crew from Dearne fire station after her parents took her to hospital.
"If we weren't here to rescue toddlers from mop buckets, who would?" said a South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue spokesperson.
"We're delighted Minnie is safe and well and hope she is recovering from her ordeal.
"This is just one of thousands of special service incidents we attend each year, in addition to all the fires and road traffic collisions."
South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue revealed details of the incident on Twitter.
Minnie's mother, Gemma, who was upstairs when her daughter became stuck, said: "My son shouted me and said 'Mum, Minnie is stuck'.
"I ran back downstairs and she was stuck in the bucket.
"I tried to get her out. I put the bucket in the sink and I put a bit of water in it because I thought I might be able to get her out."
