[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tourism strategy hopes to make the Borders Scotland's "premier cycling destination" by 2021.

The draft document outlines a string of strengths the region already has but also the challenges it faces.
Among the potential improvements is an off-road route between Galashiels and Edinburgh via Peebles.
Councillors are being asked to agree sending the document out for consultation before its final version is completed.
The Scottish Borders Cycle Tourism Strategy said the region had a "long-established" reputation for leisure cycling gained thanks to the 7Stanes mountain biking routes and other trails.
It said that in the first nine months of 2015 alone, cycling tourism had been worth about Â£155m across Scotland.
However, it highlighted the lack of specific economic impact figures for the Scottish Borders as an issue which needed to be addressed in order to measure progress.
The report also recognised the competition the region faced from other areas which are keen to promote cycling including Perthshire, Dumfries and Galloway and the Highlands.
Among the developments which it said could "enhance the product offering" in the Borders are:
"It is crucial for the Scottish Borders not to fall behind and continued product development is a priority in order to maintain a competitive position," the report concluded.
"Development of infrastructure and product development of the tourism offer are key.
"The Scottish Borders must have a structured strategy and action plan with the appropriate investment in order to maintain and expand its position as Scotland's leading cycling destination."
