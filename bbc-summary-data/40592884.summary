Councillors have deferred a decision on a proposed 10-turbine wind farm in the Galloway hills.

Burcote Wind wants to construct the scheme near Carsphairn which it said would put about Â£2.5m into a community benefit fund over its operational life.
Planners had recommended refusal due to the cumulative landscape impact in the area.
Dumfries and Galloway Council's planning committee decided it wanted a site visit before making a decision.
