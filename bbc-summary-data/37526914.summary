[SN]TITLE[SN]
Luton Town 1-1 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe fought back from a goal down to earn a deserved point at fellow promotion hopefuls Luton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors went close in the opening minute, Charlie Kirk's low effort flying into the side-netting, before Chris Dagnall's shot from close range was parried by goalkeeper Christian Walton, who also turned aside Billy Bingham's daisy-cutter.
Cameron McGeehan tested Ben Garratt from distance midway through the first period before Luton went ahead just before half-time when Pelly Ruddock released Jake Gray and his volley was turned home by Danny Hylton.
In the second period, Tom Lowery dragged wide for the visitors and Bingham's half-volley from distance flew narrowly past the post, with Geroge Cooper's free-kick landing on the roof of the net.
The visitors were deservedly level in the 64th minute when Cooper's exquisite cross was headed beyond Walton by Alex's top scorer Ryan Lowe.
Alan Sheehan sent a free-kick harmlessly over the top for the hosts, with Hylton also stabbing off target from Scott Cuthbert's header, while sub Josh McQuoid could not keep his ambitious effort down as Luton had to settle for a third straight draw in the league.
