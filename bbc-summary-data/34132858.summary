David West murder: Son unleashed 'torrent of abuse'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An heir to a nightclub chain stabbed his father to death after a barrage of abuse, fearing his inheritance was being wasted, a court heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David West, 45, is accused of murdering his father, also called David West.
In court, Mr West senior's personal assistant compared working for the older man to being part of a "dysfunctional family".
Mr West junior admits the killing, but denies murder by reason of loss of control.
The Old Bailey heard the pair had a turbulent relationship and Mr West Sr sacked his son the day he was killed.
Following an argument, Mr West Jr was said to have drunk several glasses of whisky before taking a large knife from his flat and going to his father's house on 12 December last year.
Mr West Sr's personal assistant, Oksana Stanzione, told the Old Bailey shouting and swearing was a "way of life" and while the son would usually walk away from arguments, on the day of the killing the "floodgates opened".
Recalling the argument in the bar of Abracadabra, one of a string of West End nightspots owned by the family, Ms Stanzione said: "He [Mr West Jr] said 'I wish you were dead, I hate you. You are a horrible, horrible man and I think if you died it would do a lot of people a favour. I don't want to work for you any more'.
"There was a lot of swearing."
She said Mr West Jr believed his father was wasting money which should have been his inheritance.
The court was shown CCTV footage from inside the restaurant which showed the defendant throwing a bar stool as the argument became more heated.
The court heard that after the row, Ms Stanzione helped Mr West Sr back back to his house where he collapsed drunk at the bottom of the stairs.
His son is alleged to have then let himself in and stabbed him twice with a kitchen knife - once in the neck and chest - before returning to the restaurant bar to dial 999.
The case continues.
