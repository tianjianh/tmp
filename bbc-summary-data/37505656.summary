Scotmid warns of 'challenges' ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish co-operative society Scotmid has warned that it faces a challenging year ahead as a result of higher wage bills and the Brexit vote.

The warning came as it reported a small rise in turnover and flat profits for the six months to 30 July.
It said it expected "general market uncertainties" to continue until the shape of the UK's terms of exit from the EU became clear.
It also warned that the National Living Wage was having an impact on costs.
Trading profit of Â£2m for the half was in line with the same period last year, while turnover was up by Â£4m to Â£185m.
In a trading statement, Scotmid said it had been a "positive" performance against the background of a sluggish Scottish retail market and "a period of considerable uncertainty".
Chief executive John Brodie said: "At the year-end we highlighted the specific challenge of the NLW (National Living Wage) in the context of an unfavourable Scottish retail market.
"The society has delivered a positive initial response to this challenge by accelerating continuous improvement initiatives while maintaining focus on the development of our core business to deliver a solid first-half result.
"However, the last six months has seen the magnification of general market uncertainties both in the lead up to, and after,  the result of the Brexit referendum and we anticipate that the uncertainty will continue until the shape of the UK's terms of exit become clear.
"Consequently, we expect the second half of 2016 to be equally or more challenging with the full cost impact of the NLW.
"This will also continue into 2017 when we face further cost increases including the apprenticeship levy."
Scotmid operates about 350 retail outlets across Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England. Its businesses include Scotmid Food, Semichem, funeral services and a property division.
