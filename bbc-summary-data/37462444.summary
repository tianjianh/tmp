Blaise Matuidi calls for calm as Paris St-Germain falter under Unai Emery

Blaise Matuidi has urged Paris St-Germain not to panic after a below-par start to the season that has put new manager Unai Emery under pressure.

PSG's 2-0 defeat at Toulouse on Friday was their second in seven Ligue 1 games - as many as the champions suffered throughout the whole of last season.
"Each season it's tough - this year even more so than previously," France midfielder Matuidi said.
"We mustn't worry, and just get back to work."
Emery led Sevilla to three successive Europa League titles - beating Liverpool in last season's final - before leaving to replace Laurent Blanc at the Parc des Princes in June.
He arrived at a club who won all four major domestic trophies last season, including the French league championship for the fourth year in a row.
But Friday's defeat left PSG third in Ligue 1, behind Toulouse and early leaders Nice, and they are likely to slip down the table as the rest of the weekend's fixtures are played.
Emery suggested the match turned on the second-half sending off of defender Serge Aurier for conceding the penalty from which Yann Bodger gave Toulouse the lead.
"The referee has not been good to us," Emery said. "The action of expulsion, the penalty is the action that changes the game.
"After, with one player less on our side, the team needed patience and calm in the minutes that followed to score a goal.
"But with the mistakes we have made, the match was over. It must be analysed to work on managing the emotions of players when the game gets a little more difficult."
PSG's next match is away to Bulgarian side Ludogorets Razgrad in the Champions League on Wednesday.
