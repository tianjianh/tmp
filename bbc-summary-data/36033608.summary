Helen Fairhead captured the charming footage of the three-year-old gorilla, called Lope, on a visit to Twycross Zoo in Leicestershire.
More than one million people have watched the video on Facebook with hundreds leaving comments.
The zoo's director of life sciences Dr Charlotte Macdonald said Lope's "dance" is evidence of him playing - an important aspect of young apes' behaviour.
