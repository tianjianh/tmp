Anthony Scaramucci: Who is the new White House communications director?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
President Donald Trump has triggered a shake-up by appointing Wall Street financier Anthony Scaramucci as his White House communications director.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer quit, reportedly in response to the move, which was announced on 21 July.
He had been partially filling the communications role since the previous incumbent Michael Dubke resigned in May.
So, what do we know about the president's new mouthpiece?
Firstly, Anthony Scaramucci, 52, is a long-standing Trump supporter who has known the president for years.
A major Republican donor and founder of investment firm SkyBridge Capital, he served as an adviser on the presidential transition team.
Mr Scaramucci is currently a senior vice-president and chief strategy officer at the Export-Import Bank - the US government's export credit agency.
He is expected to begin his new job in August.
Following Mr Spicer's departure, he will be working with Sarah Huckabee Sanders - who now takes on the White House press secretary mantle, having been deputy.
In January 2017, the Wall Street bigwig was linked to the role of director for the Office of Public Liaison - where he would have managed the administration's engagement with the US business and political communities.
The job failed to materialise due to complications over the sale of his stake in SkyBridge, which meant it would take months for him to pass conflict-of-interest checks.
Mr Scaramucci is nicknamed "The Mooch", except by former President George W Bush, who reportedly calls him "Gucci Scaramucci".
The well-groomed banker previously hosted a financial television show, Wall Street Week, on Fox Business.
He is the author of three books, entitled Hopping Over the Rabbit Hole: How Entrepreneurs Turn Failure Into Success; Goodbye Gordon Gekko: How to Find Your Fortune without Losing Your Soul; and The Little Book of Hedge Funds (Little Books. Big Profits).
He has also contributed to the Fox News Channel, and staunchly defended the president in TV appearances.
A White House official told Reuters that the financier was interviewed by Mr Trump on Friday morning, and that the job was duly offered and accepted. The president's daughter Ivanka Trump was said to have attended the 30-minute meeting.
In a news conference shortly after his appointment, Mr Scaramucci addressed rumours of tension between himself and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, saying he considered him "a brother".
He said the pair had been "personal friends for six years" and that Mr Priebus was involved in him joining as communications director.
"We are a little bit like brothers where we rough each other up once in a while - which is totally normal for brothers," he said.
Mr Scaramucci, who claimed that he "loves" the president, also addressed an embarrassing 2015 moment where he branded Mr Trump a "hack politician" on Fox Business.
After Mr Trump criticised the hedge fund industry, the money man accused him of "anti-American" rhetoric and said he was on track to be president of "the Queens County Bullies' Association".
"The politicians don't want to go at Trump because he's got a big mouth and they're afraid he will light them up on Fox News," he sniped.
"I'm not a politician. You're an inherited money dude from Queens County. Bring it, Donald!"
It's not the only awkward moment Mr Scaramucci has shrugged off in his time.
In November 2016, when he was vice chair of the presidential inaugural committee, he told the BBC that Sir Elton John would be performing at Donald Trump's inauguration.
The singer's spokesperson called the claim "completely untrue".
In the same interview, Mr Scaramucci said he was "a gay rights activist" who had donated financially to the pro-gay rights group American Unity PAC, and supported marriage equality.
In 2010 he told the New York Times: "I'm pro-gay marriage. Pro-choice. Against the death penalty. I have no problem if the government raises my taxes."
In January 2017, in an interview with New York magazine, he said one thing he had learned about "these people in Washington" is that "they have no money".
That, he said, was why they fought about what seat they were in and what their title was.
During a 2010 television debate, Mr Scaramucci said to President Barack Obama: "When are we going to stop whacking Wall Street like a piÃ±ata?"
Mr Obama replied: "I have been amused by this sense of me beating up on Wall Street. I think most folks on Main Street [working Americans] think they got beat up on."
After some media picked up on the exchange, Mr Scaramucci said he had misspoke. "I realised that I came off as an elitist, and I regret that," he said.
The Harvard-educated millionaire is close to Mr Trump's eldest son, Donald Jr, and respected by Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner - a senior adviser to the president.
He recently tweeted in defence of Donald Jr after news broke that he had met a Russian lawyer last year during the election campaign.
Mr Scaramucci said he was "proud to call him a friend".
One of Mr Scaramucci's first challenges will be the questions swirling around the Trump administration's alleged links to Russia, and potential Kremlin meddling in the 2016 election.
The banker was himself linked to the story by CNN in a report it later retracted, which claimed he had met a Russian investor prior to Mr Trump's inauguration.
Three CNN journalists later resigned over the story.
