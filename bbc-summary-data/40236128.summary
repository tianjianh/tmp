The all-rounder, who began day three on 78, batted for 452 balls, hitting 23 fours and a six to get past his previous best of 256 before Notts captain Chris Read declared on 535-8.
Patel was supported by Read (40) and Luke Wood (38 not out) as they moved on from their overnight score of 221-3.
Wood trapped Cameron Bancroft lbw as Gloucestershire reached stumps at 30-1.
Patel has long been a solid performer for Nottinghamshire, but coming into the game he was yet to score a century this season, with just a single fifty to his name.
However, he showed patience and skill to dominate the home side's attack, punishing bad balls to give Notts a chance of setting up a fifth win of the season on day four.
Samit Patel told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"I'm delighted. It reminds you of the bad days that you have with the bat. Days like this are when you have to make the most of it. I've been training pretty hard and my mindset has been pretty good for weeks now but I've not been converting as I should really.
"I was the most nervous on 256, needing one for the career-best but the boys were all really chuffed for me.
"I'm looking forward to a bowl tomorrow now and hopefully we can get over the line and win the game."
