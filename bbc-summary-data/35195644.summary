It happened on the Gleneeny Road on Tuesday afternoon.
He was up to his waist in water and had a cut to his head when the fire and rescue service arrived at the scene before 15:00 GMT.
The man's been taken to Craigavon Area hospital for treatment for severe head injuries.
His condition is described as serious but stable.
Stephen Gaffney from the Fire and Rescue Service said the man was a contractor who was working on his own excavating land when he got into difficulties.
"Somehow he managed to slip into the 15ft hole and he became trapped in water," he said.
"He was wedged by a concrete pipe and surrounding mud.
"He's been taken to hospital with severe head injuries and minor leg injuries.
"The mud around the man hole was saturated by heavy rain."
