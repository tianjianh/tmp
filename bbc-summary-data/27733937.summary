Former Met officers admit misconduct in public office

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two former Metropolitan Police officers have pleaded guilty to misconduct in public office at the Old Bailey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Timothy Edwards, 48, from Surrey, pleaded guilty to one charge and was sentenced to two years in prison.
Edwards, who worked at Heathrow airport, received more than Â£22,000 for selling stories to a newspaper between 31 March 2008 and 1 July 2011.
Sam Azouelos, 35, from north London, admitted one count and is due to be sentenced on 4 July.
Azouelos, who admitted misconduct in public office between 3 July 2006 and 30 April 2010, was granted bail at the Old Bailey.
However, Judge Richard Marks QC warned that he too faced jail.
PC Timothy Edwards, who was sacked by the Met in 2013, provided up to 30 stories involving celebrities, drug smuggling and the behaviour of airline crew to a newspaper over a three-year period in exchange for money.
He took evidence from the police computer system, including crime reports and custody records.
The court heard how one woman - whose story was turned into a "smutty sex-laden scandal" - suffered such "severe emotional stress" she tried to take her own life.
Sentencing Edwards, from Lingfield, the judge told him he had been working for "two paymasters".
"Your case is a particularly serious one of its type, bearing in mind the number of stories involved, the amount of money you received and the period of time it went on," he added.
