The 37-year-old wicketkeeper, who made his debut in 1998, has played a total of 658 appearances in all competitions.
Notts' 2015 player of the year said: "Decisions about contracts are all about how I'm feeling fitness-wise and whether I'm performing at a high level.
"I still love the game, I love playing for Nottinghamshire and I'm not thinking about retirement."
