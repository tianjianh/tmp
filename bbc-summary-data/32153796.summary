The Minton archive, which contains hundreds of designs, drawings and patterns from famous Victorian designers - including Augustus Pugin - had been put up for sale by its former owners Waterford Wedgwood.
However, the Art Fund, a national charity, led a campaign to raise the money to keep it in the city.
The fund said it was "delighted".
It said it had been trying to protect the archive from sale at auction and "piecemeal dispersal" since it was first put up for sale in 2007.
It agreed a price with the archive's current owners, the Waterford Wedgwood Royal Doulton company, which said it was "delighted" the archive would remain in Staffordshire.
Minton was a ceramics company which merged with Royal Doulton after World War Two.
The archive will now be catalogued and parts of it put on display at the Wedgwood Museum and the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke.
Stephen Deuchar, director of the Art Fund, said: "For years, the Art Fund has fought to protect the Minton Archive, keeping it in its rightful place in Staffordshire, and bringing it into safe public ownership.
"We're delighted that an archive that incorporates major works of art amidst a treasure trove of industrial history has finally been saved for the nation."
Charlie Stewart, from Stoke-on-Trent City Council, said: "The archive gives us a direct insight into the lives of Stoke-on-Trent people in the 19th and 20th centuries and is a priceless window into the city's industrial heritage."
