It comes after shopkeepers claimed their trade was being affected by the abuse of regulations.
They have blamed the removal of the police traffic warden service more than two years ago.
A council report on the possibility of introducing its own wardens will be considered next month.
Councillors were told this week that the impact of the removal of the old service had not been as big as was generally perceived.
It was claimed parking habits had "not actually changed significantly".
However, a petition from regeneration group Future Hawick said there had been a "marked increase in the abuse of parking regulations".
Now letters will be sent out reminding people in the area of the parking regulations and notices put up in Hawick Town Hall encouraging staff and visitors to use off-street parking.
Councillor Alec Nicol said a full report on the issue of on-street parking would be considered next month.
"There are some things that could be done immediately which may alleviate some of the issues in the short term," he added.
