The Haxby Road crossing in York has seen a "staggering" 25 incidents in the last 12 months, Network Rail said.
It launched an awareness drive on Wednesday in a bid to cut the number of vehicles crossing at the last minute.
Vicki Beadle, of Network Rail, said drivers ignoring warning lights and sirens risked death or serious injury.
Of the 25 incidents recorded, 20 involved vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians going through the red light when it started flashing and two incidents were when groups of children were playing with the barriers while they were closing.
In another, a schoolgirl got caught in a barrier as it was closing,
On one occasion, a barrier hit a bus, and three further reports involved children.
Ms Beadle said: "The level crossing at Haxby Road has seen on average one incident every two weeks for the last year which is extremely concerning.
"As well as the obvious risk of injury or worse, misusing crossings can delay trains and traffic and can lead to prosecution, a fine, penalty points or disqualification."
