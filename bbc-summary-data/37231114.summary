[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stearman, 29, returns to Molineux less than 12 months after he left Wolves to join Fulham in September 2015.
"I think it will be quite emotional. When I left I didn't really get the chance to speak to the fans which hurt," Stearman said of his return.
"It will be great that I never really needed to say goodbye because I'm back and I can say hello."
