The visitors led when Simon Makienok finished calmly for his second league goal this season from Greg Cunningham's pass just before the interval.
Forest improved after the break and they levelled when Thomas Lam's volley went in via the post and Preston goalkeeper Chris Maxwell.
Makienok and Alan Browne forced fine saves from Forest's Vladimir Stojkovic as the match finished level.
Forest, who had been hammered 3-0 at rivals Derby on Sunday, started slowly and could have fallen behind in the opening minutes when Stojkovic saved brilliantly from Callum Robinson before later diverting Browne's strike from range onto the post.
Nicklas Bendtner should have put the hosts in front when he fired over from Eric Lichaj's cross before Makienok scored just his second league goal of the season.
Philippe Montanier changed formation at the break and Forest got the goal their improvement deserved when Lam's shot hit the post before bouncing off Maxwell's heel and into the net.
Both teams had chances to win it, with Preston defender Alex Baptiste producing a brilliant goal-line clearance to deny Apostolos Vellios in the dying minutes.
Nottingham Forest manager Philippe Montanier told BBC Radio Nottingham:
"We deserved to lose the first half. The first half was awful, but we had a good reaction and a good game in the second half.
"The players showed good determination at the beginning of the second half and after that we were confident."
Preston manager Simon Grayson told BBC Radio Lancashire:
"If you'd offered us a point before the start of the game, we'd have taken it because you expect Forest to have a reaction from the weekend's result.
"But we knew that if we got after them early on we could put them on the back foot and we did that.
"Overall I thought we had a very, very good first half. You just want to have that extra goal to go in 2-0 possibly at half-time based on how well we'd played.
"Second half, you knew there was going to be a reaction and they changed their system and had a go at us so it's a bit frustrating that we've not won the game, but the way the second half went at times I'm delighted we got another point."
