A tight first half was scoreless for 30 minutes until Paddy Jackson's two penalties put Ulster 6-3 up at the break.
Rhys Patchell struck his second penalty to bring Blues level but Craig Gilroy's try put the Ulster back in front.
Patchell combined with Ray Lee-Lo for a fine team score, before Aled Sumerhill touched down to seal victory.
Despite a second successive defeat against Welsh opposition - following their home loss to Scarlets - Ulster stay fourth in the Pro12 table.
The visitors seemed in control at the Arms Park when wing Gilroy ran in unopposed to put them 13-6 in front.
But the Blues responded strongly, camping themselves in their opponents' 22 and reducing their deficit with a third Patchell penalty.
The Wales international fly-half then provided the game's defining moment as he exchanged passes with centre Lee-Lo before touching down for an impressive try.
The Blues demonstrated a similar poise to put the game beyond doubt, capitalising on an overlap for Summerhill to score in the corner.
