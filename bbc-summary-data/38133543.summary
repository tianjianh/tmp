The 23-year-old was forced off after just 17 minutes of the game and will miss Tuesday's trip to Dagenham and Redbridge in the National League.
"It's worrying because he's been excellent," Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"The way he's been playing and pressing, he's been one of, if not our most, consistent outfield players."
