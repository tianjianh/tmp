During the brief hearing at South Lincolnshire Coroner's Office in Boston, coroner Paul Cooper said the full inquest would look into how the shotgun was obtained and the state of the marital relationship between Mr and Mrs Hart.
He added the full inquest is due to take place on 19 October.
After the shooting, police searched the family home in the village of Moulton, five miles (8km) from the centre of Spalding.
Lincolnshire Police previously said Mr Hart "was not a shotgun certificate or firearms licence holder".
