Contractors accidentally severed the pipe on Thursday, causing a gas leak which led to the evacuation of the nearby Premier Inn and Ashbridge Inn.
Avondale Road, Chapel Lane and Pontrhydyrun Road remain shut while work is carried out to repair the pipe.
Wales & West Utilities said the pipe could be made safe by midnight Friday.
A spokesperson said: "This is a very complex job, and our engineers are working round the clock to resolve the situation as safely and as quickly as possible.
"We anticipate that the pipe will be made safe, and the gas leak stopped, by midnight tonight [9 October], and our engineers will then make a permanent repair to the pipe.
"When the pipe is made safe, the pub and hotel will reopen, and we will review what traffic management will be needed to make a permanent repair."
No gas supplies have been affected by the leak.
