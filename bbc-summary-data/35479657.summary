Chinese Super League side Guangzhou Evergrande have broken the Asian transfer record by signing Atletico Madrid's Jackson Martinez for £31m.

The 29-year-old Colombia striker has signed a four-year deal and will join winter training in Dubai on 9 February following a physical examination.
He scored only three goals in 22 appearances for Atletico following his £24.8m move from Porto last summer.
Martinez is the latest high-profile player to move to China this year.
Former Chelsea midfielder Ramires and ex-Serie A duo Gervinho and Fredy Guarin are among the other big Chinese signings in 2016.
The transfer of Ramires to Jiangsu Suning last week - for what was believed to be around £25m - set the previous Asian record.
Martinez's manager at Guangzhou is former Chelsea and Brazil boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, while former Tottenham midfielder Paulinho and compatriot Robinho will be his new team-mates.
According to Germany's Transfer Market statistics, Super League teams spent £81m (108 euros) on players and coaches in the 2014-15 season, making it second only to the Premier League.
