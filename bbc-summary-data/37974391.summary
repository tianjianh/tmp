Gordon Strachan should stay as Scotland manager while they still have a chance of qualifying for the World Cup, says former Scotland striker Kris Boyd.

Strachan is considering his future before a debrief with the Scottish FA after a 3-0 loss to England left the Scots in fifth place in Group F.
"For me, he should stay," Boyd told BBC 5 live. "He is hurting, there is no doubt about it, same as everybody else.
"Is there anybody better out there? No, I don't think there is."
Friday's defeat at Wembley was Scotland's second in their opening four qualifiers. They are six points behind leaders England and four off Slovenia in second place, a position which could earn a play-off spot.
Kilmarnock striker Boyd, who won 18 Scotland caps between 2006 and 2010, believes the current squad are happy working under Strachan, despite recent results.
"You can always tell - the players turn up for an international gathering with a smile on their faces, they want to be there," he said.
"I have not spoken to one player who has a bad word to say about Gordon or his training. Everyone loves going to be a part of the Scotland set-up."
Despite their receding hopes of qualification, Boyd believes the campaign is far from over given Scotland have four of their remaining six games at home.
"We went to Wembley with a game plan and, apart from silly mistakes, we could have come away with something," he added.
"I know that sounds stupid after a 3-0 defeat, but the fine margins that win and lose games happened with Scotland.
"I just think there is an opportunity round the corner. Four of the next six qualifying games are at home, which is massive. We have got quite a decent record at home.
"We know the results have not been good enough, but we have been to Wembley now, it is out of the way.
"We have got home games against Slovenia, Malta and Slovakia. We have Slovenia home and away and, if we got four points from those games, we are back in the group because we are only four points behind and the rest of the teams still have to play England as well.
"With six games left and four of them at home, I don't think the campaign is finished.
"I think it is finished to win the group, but I don't think it is finished to be runners-up."
