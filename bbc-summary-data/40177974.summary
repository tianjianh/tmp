Jake Mamo scored four tries as a resurgent Huddersfield Giants demolished coachless Catalans Dragons for a famous win in Perpignan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Giants overcame searing heat to go in 22-6 up at half-time through tries from Aaron Murphy, Shannon Wakeman, Danny Brough and Mamo.
Tony Gigot had the Dragons only reply, but normal service soon resumed.
Brough and Mamo scythed through with ease, while winger Jermaine McGillvary also ran in a treble.
Sam Moa's late effort was little consolation for a well-beaten Catalans side.
McGillvary's haul took the England winger's career points tally up to 500, helping equal Huddersfield's record margin of victory against the French outfit, and the win itself also took the visitors above Catalans in the Super League table.
Huddersfield have steadily improved this season under coach Rick Stone, despite a slow start, and this game showcased the quality of his pre-season recruitment.
Wakeman was a winter acquisition, but it was Mamo of the signings who made the biggest impression.
The former Newcastle Knights full-back had a delayed start to the campaign through injury, but since returning to fitness has imposed himself on the Giants attack with line-breaks, pace and support play.
Catalans meanwhile are in a state of freefall, having parted with Laurent Frayssinous as coach, and their interim staff of Michael Monaghan and Jerome Guisset have been unable to arrest the slump.
The loss of marquee import Greg Bird to injury at Widnes last weekend meant a debut for Nabil Djalout in the back-row, a tough introduction to Super League life as the Dragons were dominated throughout.

Huddersfield Giants: Mamo; McGillvary. Cudjoe, Turner, Murphy; Brough, Ridyard; Ikahihifo, Leeming, Wakeman, Roberts, Ferguson, Hinchcliffe
