SAS selection deaths: Paramedics not told precise location

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It may have taken 45 minutes for a 999 call to be made after an army reservist collapsed on an SAS test exercise which led to three deaths, an inquest has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy county but lived in London, died on the course on the "boiling hot" day in the Brecon Beacons in July 2013.
His colleagues L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby died in hospital.
The ambulance crew said they were not given a precise location to attend.
An army medic on duty that day said he was unaware all activity should have been stopped when another soldier had already suffered heat illness.
The inquest in the West Midlands was told the ambulance crew found an Army truck about 10 minutes after they had been dispatched then walked for half a hour to reach L/Cpl Roberts, 24.
Ambulance technician Wayne Thomas told how everyone "tried their hardest and their best" to save him, explaining how resuscitation was used and medication given.
A statement from paramedic Geraint Tucker read: "The environment was boiling hot - the first thing I did was ask for water which I was given, but I cannot comment on how much water was available."
The statement also said there was "more than adequate equipment and knowledge" from the medics who had attended before him.
The hearing has previously been told the exercise took place on one of the hottest days of the year on 13 July 2013, with temperatures expected to hit 27C (80.6F).
The inquest continues.
