Viviani powered ahead of Sonny Colbrelli and Michael Schwarzmann at the end of Friday's 180km ride around Payerne in western Switzerland.
Britain's three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome finished 68th.
The 31-year-old Team Sky rider stays 29 seconds behind Felline as he continues preparations for the 2017 Tour.
