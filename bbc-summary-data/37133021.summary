[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hungarian ex-police officer jailed for Luton child sex assault

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Hungarian policeman living in the UK has been jailed for almost nine years for sexually assaulting a child, in a case a judge said showed "extraordinary levels of perversion".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Csongor Sandor, 30, of Dallow Road, Luton, was arrested in June after police, acting on information, found a photo of the attack on his phone.
Other images of children were also found stored on the device.
At Luton Crown Court he admitted sexually assaulting a child under 13.
Sandor also admitted three counts of making indecent images of children.
The court heard that at the time of his arrest, police found a photo of a young girl being sexually assaulted by Sandor which he had taken three months previously.
The former police officer, from Budapest, had been living in the UK for four years.
The court was told he had been employed at an Amazon depot in Hemel Hempstead and was described as a "man of good character".
Judge Michael Kay QC said although Sandor appeared willing to seek help to tackle his urges concerning children, he posed a risk to the public of committing further serious offences.
He jailed him for eight years and eight months and told Sandor that once he was released he would be made subject to an extended period on licence for five years.
He has also been put on the sex offenders' register.
