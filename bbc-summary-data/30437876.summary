[SN]TITLE[SN]
Andrew Dosiuk killer Michael Furniss jailed for life

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who executed his sleeping victim in a "cold-blooded, brutal murder" has been jailed for a minimum of 32 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Married father-of-two Michael Furniss, 50, shot Andrew Dosiuk three times in the chest as he lay in his bed at his Nottingham home.
In the eight week trial, the prosecution said Furniss was a contract killer but two other men accused of hiring him were cleared.
Furniss was handed a life term with a minimum of 32 years and 11 months.
The judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: "This was a cold-blooded, brutal murder of a defenceless man, asleep in his bed at home."
The court heard Furniss had a key to Mr Dosiuk's Laneham Avenue house and let himself into the building on several aborted attempts to kill him.
On one occasion the killer called at the house while his victim was taking his eight-year-old son to Alton Towers.
Mr Dosiuk, 33, known as "Dosh", was described in court as leading a double life, one a "fairly normal" social and family life, the other in the "murky and destructive" world of drugs.
He was due to be tried for several drugs offences when he died.
On the morning of 11 November last year, Furniss shot his victim three times as he slept, holding the 9mm pistol so close that blood and DNA was found in the barrel of the gun.
"This was a cold-blooded execution," Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said. "It was fortunate that [his son] was not staying over that night."
After the killing, Furniss hid the gun and burnt his clothes.
He later returned to retrieve the weapon with his work lorry which was equipped with a camera, filming him picking it up and stashing it elsewhere, the court was told.
"The prosecution argued that this was a contract killing and you Furniss clearly shot Andrew Dosiuk in the expectation of getting paid," the judge said.
But because two other men were cleared of any involvement, this could not form part of his sentencing.
Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said there was little to mitigate the case except Furniss' age.
The murder was aggravated by the amount of planning that went in to it, the fact that it was in cold blood and the destruction of evidence afterwards, he said.
The 395 days he has spent on remand were taken into account in the sentence.
