[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chelsea 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea returned to the top of the table after coming from behind at Stamford Bridge to inflict Tottenham's first Premier League defeat this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Spurs looked on course to recover from their midweek Champions League exit when Christian Eriksen's superb 11th minute strike put them in front.
Mauricio Pochettino's side were completely dominant until the closing seconds of the first half when Pedro curled in a spectacular right-foot effort to draw Chelsea level.
And Spurs' miserable record at Stamford Bridge was extended to 30 games without a win - dating back to February 1990 - after Victor Moses scored what proved to be the winner six minutes after the restart.
Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris and Jan Vertonghen both got touches on Moses' goal-bound strike but the ball flew in as Chelsea recorded a seventh league victory in succession.
When Chelsea lost 3-0 to Arsenal on 24 September - a scoreline that flattered them - Conte's side dropped to 10th in the table, eight points behind then leaders Manchester City.
Conte was highly emotional in his post-match briefing but promised to put matters right. The Italian has been as good as his word and he has presided over a remarkable transformation.
He switched to three at the back, which has left no place for captain John Terry but has made surprise £30m summer signing David Luiz look more comfortable than in his first spell at Stamford Bridge.
Conte has also brought the best out of Pedro, who had struggled at Chelsea after his move from Barcelona, while Diego Costa is a warrior whose eyes are now right on the ball rather than opponents.
Chelsea look a solid, dangerous, formidable outfit and that desperate day at Emirates Stadium seems an age away after these seven straight league wins.
Victor Moses seemed destined for life away from Stamford Bridge after a succession of loan spells following his £9m move from Wigan Athletic in August 2012.
The 25-year-old had only made 23 appearances and scored one goal for Chelsea before this season and had stints at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham United before Conte took charge at Stamford Bridge.
Conte's tactical reshuffling saw Moses employed as a right wing-back in his new defensive system, the catalyst for an unlikely revival that has seen him emerge as one of Chelsea's most important players.
Moses is utilising his attacking qualities to give Chelsea width while also revelling in his more defensive duties, adding a new dimension to his own game and rewarding a manager who has complete trust in him.
The crucial goal he scored here was just reward for another fine performance and he fully deserved the standing ovation he was given when he was substituted.
This loss in a game they controlled serenely for almost 45 minutes concludes a desperate week for Spurs and manager Pochettino.
The Argentine's team selection for the defeat in Monaco that confirmed their Champions League elimination almost seemed to have one eye on this game - but two losses suggest the ploy has backfired.
Pochettino restored Jan Vertonghen, Kyle Walker and Christian Eriksen here and while the Dane put Spurs ahead they ran out of steam and ideas after Pedro equalised in the dying seconds of the first half.
Now Pochettino must pick up his disappointed players.

Chelsea boss Antonio Conte: "I am satisfied with the way we fought back. These games are difficult. It was  a tough game with a lot of intensity.
"Tottenham started well. It's not easy to go down 1-0 but I am pleased with the performance and reaction. Now it's important to continue the work.
"It's too early to talk of the title. This league is very tough. Tottenham showed in this league there are six or seven teams that can win the title. It's important to continue in this way and improve the confidence."
Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino: "If we analyse the game we were better. We competed very well and we were a bit unlucky to concede...never 1-1 at half-time. The second half we conceded a goal very early.
"We are disappointed but we need to be pleased for the performance and the way we competed against a very good team."
