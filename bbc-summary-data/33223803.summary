More than 700 plants were discovered during a police search of Wych Elm House in Harlow on Sunday morning.
Essex Police said the plants, which were in "various stages of growth", had been removed from the building, which is in the town centre.
"We are carrying out extensive enquiries into who set up and was running the unit," said PC Tim Knights.
No arrests had been made and inquiries were ongoing, an Essex Police spokeswoman added.
The crop is thought to have a potential street value of more than £1m, while hydroponics equipment used to grow the plants is worth tens of thousands of pounds, the force said.
"We would like to hear from anyone who saw people regularly going to the site and perhaps carrying large boxes of equipment or seedlings," said PC Knights.
