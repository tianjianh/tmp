Players use a long-handled racket (known as a crosse or lacrosse stick) to manoeuvre a rubber ball during play by either catching, passing or carrying it in netting attached to the end.
Lacrosse is an intense and physical game that requires speed, quickness, hand-eye coordination and a competitive instinct.
It is an active team sport providing a substantial aerobic and strength-building workout, as players run up and down a long, rectangular field to get the lacrosse ball into the goal.
