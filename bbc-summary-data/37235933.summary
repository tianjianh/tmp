[SN]TITLE[SN]
Herefordshire man left in wrong care home for 11 months

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An autistic man was left for nearly a year in an unsuitable care home because social workers delayed finding him appropriate care.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He lost out on a suitable placement because a vacancy at an appropriate home was not followed up in time, the Local Government Ombudsman (LGO) said.
As a result he spent 11 months without the support he needed.
Herefordshire council said it had apologised to the man's family and paid Â£2,500 in compensation.

Social workers had agreed to find a new home in the 'medium term,' but despite the young man's mother pushing the council to find him one, and suggesting a possible placement, it took social workers 11 months to re-house him, the LGO said.
Dr Jane Martin said the council recognised "it should have done more to proactively find" the man a suitable care placement.
The council said it accepted all its recommendations to remedy the matter, including training for social workers on the importance of keeping accurate case notes.
