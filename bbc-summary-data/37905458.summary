After a goalless 90 minutes, Francois Zoko put Yeovil ahead early in extra time with a powerful strike from range.
Akwasi Asante brought Solihull level from the spot when Omari Sterling-James was fouled by Liam Shepherd.
In the shootout, Ryan Dickson and Tom Eaves missed for Yeovil while Solihull scored four from four to progress.
Solihull Moors, who have only been in existence for nine years, will travel to another League Two side in the second round in Luton Town.
Manager Liam McDonald was in charge of the club for the first time following Marcus Bignot's departure to Grimsby Town.
The majority of the best chances to win it in normal time were saved for stoppage time when Moors had four great openings.
Eddie Jones' volley flew just wide before Artur Krysiak made three fine saves from Shepherd Murombedzi, Sterling-James and the best of the lot from Liam Daly's header.
But he could do nothing to keep out Asante's penalty - or the four that followed in the shootout.
