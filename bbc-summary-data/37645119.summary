Indyref2 bill: What's Sturgeon's message to Downing Street?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP conference that not a day passes without someone telling her to "hurry up" with a second referendum on Scottish independence.

And every day someone tells her to "slow down".
It is certainly true that every day since the EU referendum the question is asked when, or if, the SNP's call for Indyref2 - as it's known - might happen.
Follow reaction to news of a second independence referendum bill
With many commentators (myself included) concluding that the cautious, canny Sturgeon will not rush into a vote she knows she might lose.
Today Ms Sturgeon made very clear that she is prepared to trigger a second referendum if she feels that is the only way to protect Scotland from what she calls a "hard Brexit imposed by the hard right of the Tory party".
She was angered by what she heard from the Prime Minister at the Tory conference last week.
Not only did she disagree with what appeared to be the PM's vision for Brexit she was infuriated by language that seemed to suggest the PM would not take seriously the concerns of the Scottish Government.
When Theresa May came to Edinburgh shortly after becoming PM she promised the Scottish government would be "fully engaged" in Brexit discussions.
But none of those discussions have yet taken place and Ms Sturgeon fears she will not be listened to when they do.
So, her speech to the SNP conference in Glasgow today was really a clear message to Mrs May in Downing Street. A warning that if Scottish concerns are not seriously considered thenIindyref2 could be on the cards.
"If you think for one second I'm not serious about doing what it takes to protect Scotland's interests, then think again" is a pretty unequivocal message.
Ms Sturgeon neither promised nor threatened that she would definitely do it.
She still faces the significant problems.
Opinion polls suggest support for Scottish independence has barely increased since the EU referendum.
And the economic circumstances, since the fall in the price of oil, are less favourable than they were in 2014.
The SNP leader acknowledged today that if they do go for another vote the case for independence will have to be made and won. It, she also made clear, it is still an option
Today she told her party - and the UK government - in no uncertain terms that she has not ruled out the idea of another referendum and she is getting ready to go for it if she feels the time is right.
