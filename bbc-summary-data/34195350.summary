[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 300,000 counterfeit and illegally imported cigarettes and 330lbs (150kg) of tobacco have been seized in Grimsby.

Trading Standards officers working with sniffer dogs uncovered the illicit haul at six properties in the Freeman Street area of the town.
The cigarettes and tobacco would cost an estimated Â£200,00 if bought legally.
North East Lincolnshire Council's Trading Standards team said it was the largest haul since it began a crackdown on illicit products last year.
Prior to the latest haul, the team seized nearly 90,000 cigarettes and 181lbs (82.5kg) of tobacco since launching Operation Nightshade.
Councillor Terry Walker said: "This is the most significant stash to have been uncovered during Operation Nightshade and is the result of a long-term, intelligence led campaign aimed at dishonest retailers who persist in flouting the law."
