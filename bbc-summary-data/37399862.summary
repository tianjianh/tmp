The attack happened in St Cloud, 70 miles (110km) north-west of Minneapolis. The motive is unclear.
The suspected attacker reportedly made references to Allah before he was killed.
So-called Islamic State said he was one of their "soldiers".
None of the injuries suffered by the victims were life-threatening, local police said.
An off-duty police officer from another jurisdiction shot and killed the suspect, said St Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson.
The suspect, who has not been identified, was said to have been wearing the uniform of a private security firm when the attack occurred.
The attacker asked at least one person if they were Muslim, Mr Anderson said, adding police "will be diligent and get to the bottom of this".
He said police have no evidence to believe more than one person was involved in the attack.
The media arm of IS said in a statement that the attacker had carried out the operation "in response to calls to target the citizens of countries belonging to the crusader coalition."
