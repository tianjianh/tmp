New Zealand v Wales: Warren Gatland worry over injured lock Jake Ball

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lock Jake Ball has added to Wales' injury worries before their second Test against New Zealand on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was helped off in the 40-7 defeat by the Chiefs on Tuesday.
Captain and flanker Sam Warburton came through Tuesday's tour game as a late replacement for Ellis Jenkins, who pulled out with a tight thigh.
Back Gareth Anscombe and back-rower Ross Moriarty also withdrew from the bench with Jamie Roberts and Taulupe Faletau coming into the match squad.
Wales had already lost flanker Dan Lydiate with a shoulder injury before the tour and fellow British and Irish Lion George North departed after the opening 39-21 defeat by New Zealand because of a hamstring tear.
Prop Paul James (calf) and scrum-half Lloyd Williams (ankle) have also left the tour with prop Aaron Jarvis and 18-year-old Ospreys wing Keelan Giles called up.
Warburton was the only player in the starting XV against the Chiefs who featured in the opening Test.
Scarlets' Aled Davies and Rhys Patchell were on the bench having been flown to New Zealand as injury cover.
Ball came off the bench against New Zealand in Auckland and if he is ruled out of contention for the second Test, Luke Charteris will take over having led Wales in Hamilton.
