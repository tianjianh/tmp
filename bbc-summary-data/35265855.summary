[SN]TITLE[SN]
Siloh chapel in Landore, Swansea, holds final service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A chapel which dates back 138 years has held its final service on Sunday before it closes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campaigners tried to save the Grade II-listed Siloh Welsh Independent Chapel in Landore, Swansea, which can hold more than 1,000 people.
The congregation of 600 had dwindled to six.
An 18-month campaign tried to attract other community users to make the building viable, but they have been forced to admit defeat.
The final service included musical contributions, readings, prayers and a summary of the chapel's history.
