The seven, who are all male and aged between 15 and 19, were arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm.
Det Ch Insp Sam Ridding, from the force's serious and organised crime unit, said: "It is shocking to think that this group of young men were enjoying a meal in a family restaurant while holding a loaded gun."
A spokesman for Nando's said they are helping the police with their enquiries.
