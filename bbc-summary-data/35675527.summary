The Lions went ahead when Lee Gregory headed Carlos Edwards' long throw before Jed Wallace doubled their lead with a 20-yard free-kick.
The visitors nearly found the net when Brad Potts fired from range but saw Hayden White receive a second yellow for a shirt-pull on Shane Ferguson.
The hosts were awarded a penalty when Tom Aldred handled the ball, which Steve Morison converted from the spot.

"I didn't feel we were at our best today. It certainly wasn't free-flowing.
"We were clinical, we were organised, we were disciplined, we were solid, and it's a really pleasing result.
"Blackpool came and made it difficult for us but we just showed our quality at vital times."
