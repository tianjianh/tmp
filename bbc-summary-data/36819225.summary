Jordi Amat's own goal came before the rain, strong winds and lightning forced the players off in Virginia.
Substitute Anthony Grant put the game beyond doubt as Swans boss Francesco Guidolin made sweeping changes to his starting line-up.
Swansea beat Charlotte Independence 4-0 in their first tour game.
New Swans defender Mike van der Hoorn made his debut after joining from Ajax at Charlotte.
Guidolin was unconcerned with the outcome and praised his players for their "hard work".
He said: "It's normal in pre-season to have performances which are up and down.
"I think the players have worked very, very hard in this period and in this game as well.
"It was an good test for us because it is important at this stage to get used to the rhythm of games again.
"I am not worried about the results."
