Ceredigion sites sought for 2020 National Eisteddfod

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Suggestions for the potential host site of the 2020 National Eisteddfod in Ceredigion are being sought.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Council officials will meet on Tuesday to start the process of identifying where the Maes will be.
A cabinet report said 140 acres were needed, along with good mobile phone signal and, if possible, fibre broadband.
Town and community councils will be contacted, asking for suggestions to be sent to Ceredigion council by March.
Once these have been received, they will be forwarded to the National Eisteddfod board, which is responsible for choosing the host site.
The county hosted the first known eisteddfod, when Lord Rhys, prince of Deheubarth, gathered poets and musicians at his castle in Cardigan in AD 1176.
