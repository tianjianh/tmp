A collection of almost 1,000 toy robots and flying saucers could fetch more than £40,000 when they are auctioned off, experts believe.

Toy specialist auctioneers Vectis from Thornaby, Teesside, are selling the collection, which was built up over 40 years by a couple in the North East.
Key items include a rare 1939 Japanese Lilliput Robot - one of which recently sold for £11,000.
The "Out of this World" sale is due to take place on 15 March.
Auctioneer and valuer Andy Reed said: "Sci-fi, space and robots are very sought after.
"There are not many collections of this size and this is the biggest one we have handled in the last 20 years.
"We think 70% of these will go outside the UK, perhaps back to the USA and Japan."
Another rare item is an American-made Flash Gordon spaceship, also from 1939.
Mr Reed added: "It's a fascinating collection, the couple are from the North East and have asked not to be identified.
"They have been collecting for 30 to 40 years and they felt the time was right to part with it.
"They have had much enjoyment out of it over the years, travelling to fairs, shows and toy shops."
