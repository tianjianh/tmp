2023 World Cup: Ireland, France, Italy & South Africa bid to host tournament

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland have made a bid to host the 2023 World Cup, along with France, Italy and South Africa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
World Rugby confirmed that the four unions submitted their applications before Thursday's deadline.
Ireland and Italy have never staged the World Cup, although games were played in Ireland in the 1991 tournament. South Africa and France were hosts in 1995 and 2007 respectively.
The winning bid will be announced in November 2017.
South Africa Rugby wants to host the competition despite a government ban on it staging international events because it failed to meet racial transformation targets.
The 2019 World Cup will take place in Japan, the first time it has been held in Asia.
