Birmingham-born Macklin, a former British and double European champion, has quit two days before his 34th birthday after winning 35 of 41 fights.
"It's been a real rollercoaster - I've had a great career but I know now is the right time to bow out," Macklin said in a statement.
"Fifteen years is a long time in boxing and I'm not the fighter I once was."
Macklin beat Brian Rose, an ex-British super welterweight champion, on points in his last bout in April, and said it was during that fight that he realised it was time to call it a day.
"Around the half-way point, I knew it was time to retire," Macklin continued. "My face was marking up, I was getting frustrated at not being able to land my shots and I knew that physically, after a long career, my body was telling me that enough was enough."

Macklin, an ABA champion before turning professional, fought three times for the world title, losing to Germany's Felix Sturm in June 2011, Argentine great Sergio Martinez in March 2012 and current undefeated king Gennady Golovkin nearly three years ago.
"I wanted to know how good I was and test myself against the very best the sport had to offer and I can proudly say I did that," added Macklin, who won 22 of his fights by knockout.
"I fought Sturm, Sergio Martinez and the best of them all Gennady Golovkin. Most importantly, I fought them all in their prime.
"I never managed to get my hands on that elusive world title but I should have done that night in Cologne in 2011. I believe I was very unlucky to be on the wrong side of a bad decision to Felix Sturm."
Macklin, who worked with high-profile trainers including Billy Graham, Joe Gallagher, former world champion Richie Woodhall and legendary American Freddie Roach, now hopes to start a new career in the media.
