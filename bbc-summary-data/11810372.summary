The family of a schoolgirl who died from inhaling helium have warned other parents of the dangers of the gas.

Jordan McDowell, 13, from Newtownabbey was found dead by her mother after inhaling helium from a balloon bought for her birthday last Sunday.
Jordan's parents, Karen and Gareth McDowell, said they wanted to prevent other families from going through a similar experience.
"We didn't realise the dangers in it, " Mr McDowell said.
"We just don't want anyone else to go through this, it's been like a living nightmare."
Jordan's grandfather Ronnie Hamilton said he would be happy if he could get helium banned or restricted.
Helium is a colourless, odourless inert gas which has many unique properties such as low boiling point, low density and high thermic conductivity.
Members of the public will be more familiar with the usually harmless and not uncommon party trick, of inhaling helium from a balloon to a high-pitched squeaky voice.
It must be recognised that such activity can, on rare occasions, lead to adverse health effects and some deaths have been reported.
Breathing in helium displaces oxygen from the lungs which in turn, deprives vital organs of essential oxygen.
This is most acutely seen in the brain which can only manage 5-6 seconds before the person becomes unconscious.
Apart from a high-pitched voice, potential health effects of helium are dizziness, headache and suffocation.
Should anyone experience ill effects from inhaling helium, the advice is to get the person to breathe in fresh air immediately.
If symptoms persist oxygen may need to be administered, so get medical help urgently.
It is also particularly important that young children are not left unsupervised with any balloons and in particular, helium balloons as children have been known to inhale parts of the balloon, which can then block the airways with potentially life threatening consequences.
"I don't want anyone to go through what we've been through and it's about time legislation was brought in," Mr Hamilton said.
"What I would say to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles is give your children a hug and tell them how much you love them.
"Do not buy them helium, it is death, you are buying something so dangerous.
"We didn't know the dangers - we do know now and it's devastating."
Jordan's mother Karen McDowell said she still can't believe her daughter is gone.
"I keep saying to people it's like she's gone on holiday, but she'll be coming back soon, but she won't; she'll never be back."
Mr Hamilton said the family hoped that lives could be saved by raising awareness of the dangers.
"Helium is marketed as an inert gas, which makes it sound like a 'safe' substance, it's not and we don't want people to inhale it.
"Jordan was such a fun and loving girl, who always had a smile for you, and now she's gone and it just isn't worth it."
Mr and Mrs McDowell said the family are determined to stay strong.
"We have to keep it together for our other two, and we've had lots of support," Mr McDowell said.
"Jordan brought us joy for 13 short years and we will treasure those."
