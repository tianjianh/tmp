Now it has been announced that the actor who uttered those familiar words "Yes M'Lady" is to reprise the role in a remake of the 1960s TV series.
David Graham is the only original cast member to return in Thunderbirds Are Go! which will air on ITV in 2015.
Former Bond actress Rosamund Pike will play Lady Penelope.
The new show, now in production, will be a mix of CGI animation and live-action miniature sets.
"I am triple chuffed to be on board the new series of Thunderbirds Are Go! and reprising my role of dear old Parker with such a distinguished cast," said Graham.
"My driving skills are in good nick and I am delighted to be behind the wheel again with M'Lady."
Rosamund Pike, who starred in 2002's Die Another Day and the recent sci-fi comedy film The World's End, said she was "very excited to bring Lady Penelope's wry wit and taste for adventure" to a new generation.
"Exploring the scenes with David Graham has been an absolute delight. The scripts are very modern, very fresh and very funny. We're all eagerly anticipating our next stint in the recording studio!"
Thunderbirds, created by Gerry Anderson and his second wife, Sylvia, was first broadcast on ITV in 1965. Anderson died last year aged 83.
Featuring the Tracy family's emergency rescue service and their catchphrase "Thunderbirds are go!", the "supermarionation" puppet show became popular again in the 1990s.
It spawned two films in the 1960s, as well as a live-action movie adaptation in 2004.
The new voice cast also includes Kayvan Novak as inventor Brains; Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Tracy brothers Gordon and John; and Rasmus Hardiker as the Tracy brothers Alan and Scott.
The fifth Tracy brother, Virgil, will be played by David Menkin. Tracy Island matriarch Grandma Tracy is voiced by Sandra Dickinson and the villainous The Hood is played by Andres Williams.
A number of new characters not in the original series will also be introduced.
Thunderbirds Are Go! is produced by ITV Studios and New Zealand-based Pukeko Pictures, with the Weta Workshop (Avatar, King Kong, The Lord of the Rings) designing the series and producing the miniatures.
The 26 episodes will debut on ITV and CITV Channel.
