[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fulham 1-1 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derby's winless run was extended to seven league games after they could only take a point at struggling Fulham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side went ahead through debutant Marcus Olsson's own goal, before Craig Bryson volleyed the Rams level just before the break.
Late on, Richard Keogh set up Johnny Russell but he was superbly denied by keeper Fulham keeper Andy Lonergan.
The draw does little to help Derby's promotion hopes and extends Fulham's own run without a win to five games.

Derby had reason to feel aggrieved when they went behind, having enjoyed the best early chances with Keogh's header against the bar and, playing against his old side, captain Chris Baird's volley, which went just over.
Fulham's Moussa Dembele should have done better with a close-range header from a Jamie O'Hara corner, and once Bryson was substituted, Derby had less cutting edge up front, as windy conditions proved challenging for both sides.
Right at the death there were chances at both ends with Lonergan being forced to make good saves from Russell and Cyrus Christie, whilst Ross McCormack and Tom Cairney both went close for Fulham, but neither side did enough to merit all three points.

Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic: "We competed very well, we competed for all of the game.
"In my opinion we are improving - we are difficult to deal with. I cannot be happy if we don't win the game. I am a football coach."
Derby manager Paul Clement: "Under normal circumstances this might have been seen as a very valuable point. But because we've been off the back of a poor run of results, it's not what we wanted.
"We started the game brightly, it's happened a few times during this run - the goal comes against the run of play. We suffered a bit after that.
"Our goal was a fantastic goal and a great finish, so there were positives to build on in the second half."
