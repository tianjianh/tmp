Mr Norman will help the mayor get more Londoners active "by making cycling and walking safer and easier".
The appointment follows the mayor's announcement he would invest £770m on infrastructure and promotion of cycling over the next six years.

Mr Khan, said: "I'm determined to make walking and cycling safer and easier for all Londoners, which is why I'm providing more investment than ever before, and appointing a commissioner to focus full-time on this vital area of work.
"Will Norman brings to this new role an impressive track record in delivering major international projects to get more people active.
"As the first ever full-time commissioner, he will be able to make a substantial difference getting Londoners of all ages and backgrounds walking and cycling more - improving our city for everyone."
