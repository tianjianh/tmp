[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England striker Jamie Vardy will miss Leicester's visit to Manchester United on Sunday after being banned for an additional game for improper conduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vardy angrily confronted referee Jon Moss after being sent off during the 2-2 draw against West Ham on 17 April.
Leicester will wrap up the Premier League title with a win at Old Trafford after Spurs drew 1-1 with West Brom.
Having sat out Sunday's 4-0 win over Swansea, Vardy could be absent for the triumphant moment of their campaign.
The 29-year-old, who requested a personal hearing in the hope of avoiding additional punishment, was also fined Â£10,000.
Vardy, the Premier League's second top-scorer with 22 goals this season, was shown a second yellow card for diving early in the second half of the match against West Ham when he tangled with Angelo Ogbonna.
Before leaving the field, Vardy jabbed his finger and shouted at Moss, who was criticised by Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer.
Vardy will be available for the final two matches of the season against Everton (home) and Chelsea (away), when Leicester will have two more chances to clinch the title should they fail to beat Manchester United.
