The Chairboys scored early when Max Kretzschmar stroked the ball into the net after a one-on-one with the goalkeeper Callum Preston.
Jon Ashton cleared Wycombe's Sam Wood's poke off the line and Crawley's Gwion Edwards had a shot deflected wide.
Wycombe secured victory late as Garry Thompson's cross left the unmarked Wood to score at the far post.
Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"It wasn't a great game, for people who were here it was horrible game.
"Crawley are very direct, they came right at us and we got sucked in to going a little bit direct down the middle.
"They arrived late today, they got stuck in traffic. I made a big point of us starting the game well and quickly to give real pressure from the start, more than usual."
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"They do what they do and they're good at it and their team's been together for a number of years.
"We just gifted them chances and we didn't deal with one ball. We warned the players before the game but we made stupid mistakes which we must cut out.
"We've got to defend better and players know my thoughts and it's how we respond."
