[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pembs chief Bryn Parry-Jones's dispute 'cost £150,000'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The battle over unlawful pension payments to Pembrokeshire council's then chief executive cost the authority more than £150,000 in legal fees, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bryn Parry-Jones opted out of the Local Government pensions scheme and the council paid him its contributions in cash direct to him instead.
A Wales Audit Office investigation ruled the payments were unlawful.
Councillor Jacob Williams has revealed invoices of the council's legal costs.
The costs included:
Mr Jones finally left the council at the end of October last year with a £277,000 severance deal.
Earlier this week Mr Williams, the unaffiliated member for East Williamston, revealed that cancelling the leasing contract for Mr Jones's work car, a Porsche, cost the council almost £8,600 in penalty payments.
