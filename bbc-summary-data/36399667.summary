Mary Logie's death: Rolling pin murder trial date set

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman is to stand trial in December charged with murdering an 82-year-old woman with a rolling pin in Fife.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sandra Weir, 41, is accused of killing Mary Logie at the pensioner's home in Leven on 5 January 2016.
It is claimed she repeatedly struck Mrs Logie on the head and body with the rolling pin "or similar instrument".
Ms Weir is further accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by cleaning blood at the property and disposing of clothing.
Prosecutors also claim Ms Weir stole from Mrs Logie on various occasions over more than six years.
Ms Weir made her first public appearance at the High Court in Glasgow on Friday.
The indictment alleges she took a bank card or cards in the pensioner's name.
She is also said to have stolen greeting cards containing money, cash, two rings as well as what is described as "correspondence".
The charge states this occurred between April 2010 and the day of the murder.
She faces another charge of using a bank card in Mrs Logie's name to steal a total of Â£4,460.
A further allegation claims Ms Weir fraudulently used a debit card to buy Â£314 of goods at a shop in Leven.
A separate fraud charge then claims she pretended to be authorised by the Guide Dogs for the Blind charity to collect cash for them.
Prosecutors also accuse her of possessing drugs and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Her QC, Murray Macara, pled not guilty on her behalf. He also lodged a special defence of alibi in connection with the murder charge.
The hearing was told the case could involve 200 witnesses.
