Colin Trotman and Reynold Dyett deny Southend child sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have gone on trial accused of a string of sexual offences involving underage girls in Essex.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Trotman, 46, of Wetherell Road, Hackney, and Reynold Dyett, 55, of Elderfield Road, Clapton, have appeared at Basildon Crown Court.
The offences, which include rape and sexual grooming, are alleged to have taken place in Southend between July and November 2012.
Both men deny all the charges against them.
Julia Faure Walker, for the prosecution, told the jury the men regularly drove from London to Southend, where they bought alcohol for teenage girls before getting them to perform sexual acts.
It was alleged they knew some of the girls were under the age of 16.
Mr Trotman is accused of three charges of rape, two charges of sexual activity with a child and one charge of conspiracy to meet a child following sexual grooming.
Mr Dyett is accused of four charges of sexual activity with a child, one charge of sexual abuse and one charge of conspiracy to meet a child following sexual grooming.
The trial, expected to last up to four weeks, continues.
