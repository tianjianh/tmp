The Group A opener is followed by games against Bangladesh and the Netherlands as the Irish aim to secure top spot and a place in the Super 10 stage.
"You always get a thrill playing in a major tournament," said O'Brien.
"We haven't seen much of Oman but they are going to be up for it and hoping to take a couple of scalps."
He added: "Both opening groups are very, very strong. Each team has their own attributes and ways of winning games of cricket.
"Bangladesh have played excellent cricket in the last year or so. They've been very fortunate to have the Asia Cup on just before this World T20, so they'll obviously be very very difficult to beat.
"The Netherlands have beaten us twice in the last two T20s we've played so they will be up for the challenge again."
Ireland have reached the second stage of the World T20 just once, back in 2009 while it's the first tournament in charge for new coach John Bracewell.
O'Brien believes Ireland have the right balance in their squad to progress to Super 10 matches against hosts India, Australia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
"We've got a nice blend here in Dharamsala - we've obviously a lot of experience, with a little bit of youth and flair thrown in, which is what you need.
"So I think it's as good as any other squad that I've been involved in.
"We just need to play consistent cricket over the next three games, and fingers crossed it's enough to get through to the second phase."
