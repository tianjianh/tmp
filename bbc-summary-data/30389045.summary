Thomas, 28, was voted the 2014 winner by the public.
It follows a successful year for the cyclist who went straight from his highest-placed finish in the Tour de France, to win Commonwealth Games gold in the Road Race and bronze in the Time Trial.
Wiggins presented Thomas with the award at a pre-season training camp in Mallorca.
