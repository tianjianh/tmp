Remains of an "extremely rare" Iron Age chariot have been uncovered during an excavation in Leicestershire.

The University of Leicester discovered the bronze fittings from a 2nd or 3rd Century BC chariot at the Iron Age fort Burrough Hill.
Experts believe the chariot was either dismantled, or never built, and buried in a box and burnt as part of a ritual.
It is thought the chariot would have belonged to a high-status individual such as a noble or warrior.
The discovery was made by student Nora Battermann during a five-year project by the university's school of archaeology.  The parts were found in a deep pit near the remains of a house within the hill-fort near Melton Mowbray.
Dr Jeremy Taylor, from the university, said: "I've been digging for the best part of 30 years and never found anything like it.  It's a once-in-a-career discovery.
"To find a chariot is rare - in east Yorkshire there was a practice of chariot burial but outside that area it is extremely rare to find one."
Experts believe the fittings, which are highly decorative, were put in a box and then placed on a layer of cereal chaff and burnt as part of a religious ritual.
The parts, which were also found with tools thought to be equine related, have been cleaned up and will go on display at Melton's Carnegie Museum.
