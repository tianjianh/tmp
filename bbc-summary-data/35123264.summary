[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was alleged Paul Brunt received more than ??16,000 form News International for stories over 18 months from 2006.
Mr Brunt, 33, of Kentish Town, north London, was found not guilty of misconduct in a public office after a trial at the Old Bailey.
"I'm just so glad it's over," he said after the verdict.
"I'm really, really grateful. I'm happy that I can spend time with my two children over Christmas which was my main worry."
He denied two counts of misconduct in a public office and the jury took less than three hours to acquit him.
The jury in the retrial was not told that Mr Brunt had his earlier conviction over the case quashed at the Court of Appeal earlier this year.
"I just want to thank everyone for their support and bearing with me, especially my fianc??e who has gone through as much as me over the last two years," Mr Brunt said outside court.
"It obviously has an effect on your life because you are in constant fear of being sent to prison...
"I accept speaking to the press is wrong but everyone from the armed forces does need to be aware there are legal consequences they could face."
Mr Brunt's was the last of a series of trials related to Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police's investigation looking into alleged corrupt payments to public officials for information.
