Homes have been evacuated and traffic has been disrupted due to an ongoing security alert in Southway, Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The security alert began after police received a report of a suspicious object on Thursday afternoon.
A number of cordons are in place and police have warned that traffic will be affected.
A respite centre has been opened at Long Tower Youth Club for people displaced by the alert.
Sinn FÃ©in Councillor Patricia Logue said: "The people who create these alerts have nothing to offer the community and should desist immediately from their campaign of disruption."
