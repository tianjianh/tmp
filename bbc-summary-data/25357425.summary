Anne fought tirelessly for a new inquest into her son Kevin's death in the 1989 football tragedy.
If anyone triumphed over adversity, it's my mum
The Helen Rollason Award was accepted on her behalf by her daughter Sara, son Michael, and brother Danny.
"My mum embodied the very reason this award was created - strength, determination and passion," said Sara.
Anne, who had been suffering from cancer, died aged 60 just days after the annual Hillsborough memorial service at Liverpool's Anfield stadium.
She battled for more than 20 years to overturn an inquest verdict of accidental death on her 15-year-old son.
He was one of 96 Liverpool fans who died in April 1989 at the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough ground.
The BBC award - named after TV presenter Helen Rollason, who died aged 43 in 1999 after fighting cancer - is given for outstanding achievement in the face of adversity.
"Her tireless campaigning was driven by the love she had for her son Kevin and her dedication to seeking a new inquest," added Sara. "If anyone triumphed over adversity, it's my mum."
Anne's perseverance, along with fellow campaigners, prompted the creation of the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which led to the original verdicts being quashed by the High Court in December 2012, with new inquests ordered for all who died. The new hearings are due to begin next spring.
At an inquest in 1991, jurors heard that Kevin and 94 others were dead by 15:15 BST, a verdict which his mother never believed and, as a result, she refused to accept his death certificate from the coroner.
Anne, who lived in Chester, tracked down witnesses, one of whom suggested Kevin uttered the word "mum" at about 16:00 BST.
Her calls for a fresh inquest were rejected by attorney generals and the European Court of Human Rights.
But following publication of the panel's report in September 2012, a further appeal by the families of the victims to quash the verdicts was upheld.
Anne, who said she "was never going to give up", travelled to the High Court a year ago to hear the ruling, despite being terminally ill.
