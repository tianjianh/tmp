Offshore firm Maersk criticised over delays

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A North Sea firm's maintenance regime has been criticised after deadlines for work on a floating production vessel were put back for as long as two years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Health and Safety Executive said it was clear Maersk had rescheduled the maintenance on "Gryphon A" without making an assessment of the risks.
The company was issued with an improvement notice.
Maersk said it was committed to continually improving its safety performance.
