Newport County boss Mike Flynn has challenged young forward Tom Owen-Evans to keep up his good form after scoring the winner in their 1-0 win against Exeter City.

The 20-year-old scored his first goal in professional football as they sealed a vital win against the Grecians.
The result meant the Exiles are just three points of safety in League Two.
"We've definitely got momentum but that doesn't count for nothing, we're still behind two teams," Flynn said.
He continued: "There's five games to go and I'm going to be demanding. He's got to keep it going. There's competition for places.
"Riggy [Sean Rigg] will be back, [Joss] Labadie has got two more games before he's back. It is what it is, everybody is fighting now and we've got to keep going."
Flynn's side moved closer to escaping the relegation places with the win by virtue of Hartlepool United and Cheltenham Town both drawing on Saturday.
"I would prefer it if they had both lost but I've said from the start, we've got to look after our own business," Flynn added.
"We've got to keep going, working hard, resting right and we've got to keep believing.
"It's a big statement [to the rest of the league]. We're going to keep fighting and they're not going to stop fighting, not as long as I am here."
