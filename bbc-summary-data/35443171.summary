The 26-year-old has made 27 appearances for his national team, scoring 10 goals, and represented his country at both the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games.
"I am so happy to sign for Chelsea," said Pato. "It is a dream for me, I'm looking forward to getting to know my new team-mates and cannot wait to play.
"I thank Chelsea for their support and hope I can repay this faith."
The Blues, who won the Premier League last season, have had a disappointing campaign and are 13th in the table, although they are still in the Champions League.

Interim manager Guus Hiddink does not think the signing of Pato is a risk.
"It's not a gamble. Coming on loan makes it possible to view if he can adapt to the league," said Hiddink.
Chelsea are also set to sign New York Red Bulls defender Matt Miazga, 20.
"We're not rushing, but he will be one of the squad members for the future," added Hiddink.
