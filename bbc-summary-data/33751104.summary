[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The control room for the Dounreay Fast Reactor (DFR) has been placed into the care of two museums.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The DFR is the most recognised feature of the experimental nuclear power site in Caithness because of its large sphere, also known as the Dome.
National Museums Scotland and the Science Museum in London will share panels from the control room.
There were plans to keep the Dome as a historical monument but it too is to be dismantled.
Unlike the control room, the parts of the 1950s-constructed steel sphere will be scrapped.
The DFR control room is designated as being of national significance by Historic Scotland and National Museums Scotland and is to be preserved for future display in public museums.
DFR went critical in November 1959 and operated until its shutdown in March 1977.
The experimental fast breeder reactor led British research and development of nuclear energy during the 1950s and 60s.
The control room contained an operator's desk and 14 panels along three sides of the room.
Last year, the wall panels were dismantled and packed into two containers.
The control desk was cut into three sections in order to get it out of the building and placed inside a separate container.
James Gunn, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited's heritage officer, said: "The Science Museum and National Museums Scotland receive over 5.6 million visitors every year and the sharing of our unique industrial heritage with museums world renowned for their historic collections and exhibitions is a fantastic opportunity for Dounreay."
Dounreay has also recently transferred the Dounreay Materials Testing Reactor control room to local museum Caithness Horizons in Thurso.
