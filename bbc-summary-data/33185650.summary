The winners include a whisky distillery in Scotland, a fishing hut in Hampshire and Manchester's Whitworth gallery.
Fourteen of the buildings are in London, including three housing developments, two schools, Foyles bookshop and the National Theatre.
The shortlist for this year's Stirling Prize will be drawn from the 37 award-winning buildings.
"The admirable aspect shared by every one of our winners is ambition," said RIBA President Stephen Hodder.
"The UK is blighted by poor-quality new housing and dilapidated school buildings, so I am delighted that the notable trends amongst this year's RIBA National Award winners are the volume of inspiring new housing and education projects.
"All 37 of our RIBA National Award winners should provide inspiration for developers, local authorities and architects alike and will delight generations to come."
Below is a selection of this year's winners from across the country.
The Stirling Prize shortlist will be announced on 16 July.
