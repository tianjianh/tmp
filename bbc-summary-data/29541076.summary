The 28-year-old Cameroon international has not featured for the Canaries since Neil Adams became manager in April.
His last appearance was in last season's 1-0 loss to West Brom on 5 April, before Norwich suffered relegation to the Championship.
"It's important for Seb to get some first-team football and keep himself fit and involved," said Adams.
"This is a good short-term loan move for all parties involved."
The Hornets are currently one of Norwich's main rivals for promotion from the Championship, with the two sides level on points, but the Canaries are one place higher in second on goal difference.
Watford's recruitment department had already planned to sign Bassong before head coach Billy McKinlay was replaced by Slavisa Jokanovic on Tuesday.
Centre-half Gabriel Tamas is currently a long-term absentee with a knee injury.
