[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fourteen-year-old boy has admitted stabbing a supply teacher in a classroom in Bradford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, attacked Vincent Uzomah, 50 at Dixons Kings Academy on 11 June.
Mr Uzomah, who was stabbed in the stomach with a knife, is stable in hospital.
The boy denied attempted murder but admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent when he appeared at Bradford Crown Court.
His plea was accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service and Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC said the boy would be sentenced at a later date.
The teenager attacked Mr Uzomah in front of a number of other students at the start of a science class.
It is understood it happened following a disagreement over a mobile phone.
Mr Uzomah was stabbed with a kitchen knife the boy had brought from home.
After the attack the teenager ran off and was arrested by police in Bradford city centre following a six-hour search.
Judge Durham Hall said: "This is a very troubling case."
He said the boy was "undoubtedly a very troubled young man" and said Mr Uzomah was "a very brave and compassionate victim".
The teenager was remanded in custody and will be sentenced later this year.
The school, formerly called the King's Science Academy, opened in 2011 and was one of the first free schools to open.
It has about 700 pupils and has since become part of the Dixons academy group.
