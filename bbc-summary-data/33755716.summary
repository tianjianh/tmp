The plane came down near Blackbushe Airport in Hampshire on Friday, killing the pilot and all three passengers.
The airport reopened at 08:00 BST after it was shut over the weekend to allow for investigations.
The Saudi Arabian embassy in London said it was working with the British authorities to repatriate the bodies.
In a statement, the Saudi ambassador to the UK, Prince Mohammed bin Nawaf Al Saud, offered condolences to the Bin Laden family.
The plane - an Embraer Phenom 300 - is reported to have belonged to an aviation firm owned by the Saudi-based family of the former al-Qaeda leader.
The plane, which was arriving from Milan, Italy, crashed into a British Car Auctions site at the airfield, exploding on impact.
The auction firm is contacting customers after about 30 vehicles were caught up in the blast.
Hampshire police said it believed three of the dead to be the mother, sister and brother-in-law of the owner of the aircraft, all of whom are from the Bin Laden family.
A force spokesperson said the Saudi Arabian nationals were visiting the UK on holiday.
Police are carrying out a joint investigation with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB).
The airport, in Yateley, said the jet had crashed near the end of the runway while attempting to make a landing.
