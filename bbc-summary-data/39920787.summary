One-Day Cup: Yorkshire fight back to earn victory over Leicestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicestershire's slim hopes of making the One-Day Cup quarter-finals ended with defeat by Yorkshire at Headingley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a game reduced to 45 overs per side, Yorkshire recovered from 98-4 to post 258-7 thanks to 71 from Gary Ballance and 52 not out from Azeem Rafiq.
Leicestershire were given a flying start by Cameron Delport (67), only to slip from 107-1 to 189-8.
Clint McKay (35) and Dieter Klein (26) gave the Foxes hope, but they were all out for 238 with 14 balls to spare.
Worcestershire's win against Derbyshire means Yorkshire miss out on a direct passage to the semi-finals.
They finish second in the North Group and must wait to see who ends third in the South Group before they discover their quarter-final opponents.
After play was delayed for an hour by morning rain in Leeds, the home side exploited a slow surface, first by battling to a total in excess of 250, then by using their spinners to squeeze Leicestershire.
Still, despite Adam Lyth's 52, the Yorkshire top order wobbled and it needed a stand of 73 between Ballance and Tim Bresnan (34) in order to rebuild the innings.
Bresnan was dropped twice, but neither of those were as costly as the error by Klein, who grassed a loopy, diving chance off his own bowling to reprieve Rafiq, then having scored just one run.
Rafiq then belted three sixes in a 30-ball stay at the end of the Yorkshire innings, but his hitting was nothing compared to the leg-side power of Delport, the left-hander in control of the chase in a 13-over stand of 107 with Ned Eckersley (46).
But Delport holed out to long off from the off-spin of Rafiq, who bowled Mark Cosgrove two balls later.
At the other end, left-arm spinner Karl Carver stifled Leicestershire, chipping through the middle order for figures of 3-24.
When number 10 Klein joined McKay, 70 were needed from nine overs, a desperate situation that McKay set about changing with successive sixes off Ben Coad.
But when McKay went for a repeat and was caught on the leg side off Matthew Fisher, there was too much for Klein and last man Gavin Griffiths left to do.
