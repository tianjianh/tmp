However, flanker Tom Wood has been left out of the 25-man training squad.
Fiji-born soldier Rokoduguni replaces Marland Yarde at right wing, while Nathan Hughes will come in for Wood if he recovers from a leg injury.
It is understood last season's Premiership player of the season Alex Goode will start in place of regular full-back Mike Brown.
Goode last appeared for England from the bench in their Six Nations win in Italy in February.
Hughes, also born in Fiji, could make his first start if he overcomes a minor niggle, with Teimana Harrison set to step in if the Wasps player fails to recover.
Head coach Eddie Jones is seeking an 11th straight victory since taking charge of the side.
England are now ranked second in the world and face Argentina and Australia on consecutive weekends after the visit of Fiji, who are ranked 10th.
Elsewhere, with lock Dave Attwood ruled out though injury, his Bath team-mate Charlie Ewels is set to make his England debut from the bench.
It is also thought Jonathan Joseph is being considered for a return to the starting XV at the expense of Elliot Daly, after the Bath centre trained in the number 13 position on Tuesday.
Number eight Billy Vunipola recovered from upper body soreness to take a full part in the training session.
Wood started for England for the first time since the Rugby World Cup in Saturday's 37-21 victory over South Africa, but has now returned to his club Northampton. He is not injured so his release comes as a surprise.
England will confirm their match squad on Thursday.
