The 18-year-old was last seen on CCTV on the city's Longman Road at 01:00 on 10 November.
Police, RNLI Kessock lifeboat crew and the Coastguard have been involved in searches for Mr Mitchell.
His family said: "We are desperately concerned for our son who seemed to have lost his way. We would dearly love for our son to return home to us."
Police officers and dogs and specialist search teams have been focusing the search around Inverness' Longman Industrial Estate and nearby Moray Firth coastline.
In a statement, his family said: "Our son Adam left home on Wednesday afternoon (9 November) to go in town, where he was seen talking and having a laugh with people he met in the Tooth and Claw pub.
"He last spoke to his father at 20:30 in the evening."
Mr Mitchell is known to have left another pub, Wetherspoons, just after 00:00 and he was alone when seen walking down the Longman at 01:00 on CCTV on 10 November, his family said.
The statement said: "Adam is a typical teenager who loves heavy metal music. He constantly wore his off-cut denim jacket that was decorated with patches of his favourite bands, it was his pride and joy.
"He was wearing it when he was last seen over the top of his leather jacket, he always wore black jeans and black boots."
His family added: "Adam has a very distinctive look, long flowing brown hair and a beard.
"He didn't wear jewellery unless you include his headphones, he was always listening to music when he walked anywhere. He was friendly and open with everyone he met and he was a gentle, fun-loving young man who was loyal to his friends.
"This is totally out of character for Adam who rarely strayed from home without letting his parents know when he would be home."
