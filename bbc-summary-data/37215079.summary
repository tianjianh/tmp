It's always been a mystery how small birds manage to keep going straight despite being blown in different directions.
The wind tunnel makes strong gusts in a small space, so the birds can fly against it without actually going anywhere.
The scientists film them in super slow-motion to watch how they move. They hope that by learning more, they can teach robots to do the same.
BBC science reporter Victoria Gill went to see them in action.
