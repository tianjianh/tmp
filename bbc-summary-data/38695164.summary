Saunders, who scored two goals in 15 games for Wycombe during a three-month loan spell in 2015, has signed a deal until June 2018 at Adams Park.
The 33-year-old made 205 appearances for Brentford after joining from Dagenham and Redbridge in July 2009.
"Sam is a fantastic player at this level, as we saw two years ago," manager Gareth Ainsworth said.
"It's taken a lot of hard work to get the deal over the line but someone like Sam is worth it because of the quality he brings, as well as his character and professionalism."
Meanwhile, 20-year-old Brentford midfielder Jan Holldack has joined fourth-tier German side Wuppertaler SV on loan until the end of the season.
