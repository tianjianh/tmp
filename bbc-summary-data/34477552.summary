[SN]TITLE[SN]
Suicidal man 'begged' to be sectioned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review is being carried out into the care received by a man who killed himself after "begging" to be sectioned but was turned down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Thompson's parents believe he might still be alive if he had received better care.
In the weeks before his death in July, the 44-year-old was being treated as an outpatient at the Bradgate Mental Health Unit in Leicester.
Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust offered its sympathy to his family.
His mother, Margaret Timson, said: "He did beg on numerous occasions for them to section him and the answer every time was 'It's not a place you would like to go to'.
"I think, had he had some help and been taken in, he might be here today."
His stepfather Bill Timson said: "He was assessed at least three or four times.
"They should have been able to pick up that there is something wrong here, he is going to do something, he is in danger of harming himself, we need to take him away."
Mr Thompson attempted suicide more than a dozen times before his death on 16 July.
He had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder as well as other mental heath conditions and was also an alcoholic.
His mother said: "Part of me thought I knew this was going to happen, and it did, because he had no continuous help from any of the services.
"I feel he was let down."
Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust said it was not in a position to comment fully because an inquest is yet to be held.
A statement said: "Our staff are committed to providing the best care possible and we are carrying out an in-depth multi-agency review of his care to examine where we might identify any lessons to be learned and what action might be needed to address these."
