Boyega, 24, confirmed his involvement on Twitter, saying he was both "very excited" and "so happy" to be on board as both an actor and producer.
Steven S DeKnight will direct Pacific Rim: Maelstrom, which will follow on from Guillermo del Toro's original.
Del Toro said he "couldn't think of a better man for the job (than Boyega)".
"I am very proud and happy to welcome John into a fantastic sandbox," said the Mexican film-maker, who is also among the new film's producers.
"The Pacific Rim universe will be reinforced with him as a leading man as it continues to be a multicultural, multi-layered world."
Elba played officer Stacker Pentecost in the original film, which told of a war between giant monsters and the giant robots man builds to defeat them.
Fellow Londoner Boyega is best known for his role as stormtrooper Finn in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a sequel to which is currently in production.
DeKnight is best known as the creator of the US TV series Spartacus.
Legendary Pictures will produce Maelstrom with Upper Room Productions, the company Boyega set up earlier this year with agent Femi Oguns.
