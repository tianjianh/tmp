The panda got caught in bushes so the man and some of his friends rescued it.
Zoologists say that China has more than 1,590 giant pandas in the wild which are protected by the state.
The local government in the area has now asked panda experts to come up with better ways to keep the pandas safe in the area - and has told local residents to keep away from the animals.
