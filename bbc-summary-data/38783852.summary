He said: "The welcome I've had tonight has been absolutely incredible.
"Just to see the speed, the talent, the passion of the game has been brilliant for me as the first secretary of state to watch a GAA match here in Northern Ireland."
The secretary took his seat after the Irish national anthem was played explaining he was attending a meeting before the throw in.
"I don't want to offend anyone here tonight, I am here in the spirit of friendship.
"It's about enjoying the sport, which is what I am doing tonight at this great occasion," he added.
