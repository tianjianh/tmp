[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth O'Brien was 33 and from Clondalkin, Dublin. It is believed he was missing from Friday, but this was not reported to police until Saturday.
His body was dismembered and wrapped in plastic before being put in a suitcase.
The suitcase was spotted in the water by two people walking along the canal in Ardclough on Saturday afternoon.
Police believe he was killed elsewhere.
Supt Gerry Wall said: "Kenneth O'Brien was a very normal man going about his business, pursuing his employment, trying to get some work and he has been brutally murdered."
RTÃ‰ has reported that Sunday's post-mortem examination to establish the cause of death proved inconclusive and further tests are required.
Gardai (police) have again appealed for anyone who was in or around the Grand Canal near Ardclough on Friday and early Saturday to contact them.
"In addition gardai are keen to speak to anyone who may have observed, seen or had any contact with Kenneth since the early hours of Friday morning when he left Lealand Road in Clondalkin or can assist in tracing his movements," they said in a statement.
"Gardai are again asking people returning to their property or premises after the weekend to check to see if there was anything unusual.
"Was a room or equipment disturbed or their premises in anyway different than when they left. Did you as an employee or employer notice anything different in your premises?"
