The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) has announced a £700m funding package for Scottish university research for the next three years.

The Indicative Research Excellence Grant was calculated from information compiled from the Research Excellence Framework.
The SFC said the money would keep research at Scottish universities "amongst the world's best".
This latest funding follows recent investment in eight innovation centres.
The £120m Innovation Centre programme was announced in 2012 and has brought together industry, healthcare and university researchers to work in collaboration to accelerate product and service development.
Chief Executive of the Scottish Funding Council, Laurence Howells, said: "Research in Scottish universities impacts on almost every aspect of daily life, from the way we treat patients in hospital to the way we communicate with smartphones.
"Today's announcement of almost £700m will mean Scotland carries on being a winner in the competitive world of university research."
Mr Howells added: "It will mean that Scotland can continue to attract and develop the best research talent and it will mean that organisations such as Cancer Research UK and the Wellcome Trust continue to invest in Scottish universities."
