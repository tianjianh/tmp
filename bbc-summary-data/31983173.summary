The UK saw a partial eclipse, where a bit of the Sun still shone out from behind the Moon.
There were worries that cloudy weather would spoil the view across the UK, but thankfully some areas had a clear sky for the special moment.
Nature expert Mark Champion from the Lancashire Wildlife Trust visited Newsround to explain what happens to animals during an eclipse.
