The League Two play-off hopefuls have signed Ricardo Almeida Santos, 21, for £100,000 from Peterborough United.
They have also brought in fellow 21-year-old defender David Tutonda from Cardiff City on a two-year deal.
And they secured a third signing on New Year's Eve when striker Simeon Akinola, 24, agreed to move from National League side Braintree Town for £40,000.
Santos, who has signed on an undisclosed-length deal, drops a division to join the Bees after making 75 appearances for League One side Posh.
Tutonda, who failed to make a senior appearance for Cardiff, has previously spent time on loan at Newport and York.
All three deals will be formally completed on Sunday when the transfer window opens.
