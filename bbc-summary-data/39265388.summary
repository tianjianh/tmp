Children's scooters added to inflation basket

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The obsession of many young children to scoot is affecting the way the cost of living is calculated in the UK.

Children's scooters have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the UK's inflation rate.
It has replaced the swing, which was being sold less, particularly during the winter, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
The price movements of 700 goods and services are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation.
Also added to the basket were gin, flavoured ciders, non-dairy milk (such as soya or almond), men's fitness tops, and jigsaw puzzles for adults.
Gin comes back into the mix after a 13-year absence from the basket - the result of new craft distilleries popping up and rising popularity.
Bicycle helmets also return to the inflation basket after a 12-year absence.
Disappearing from the basket are alcopops, old mobile phone handsets, menthol cigarettes, and the fee for stopping cheques.
The basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to calculate the changing cost of living, as measured by the inflation rate.
A series of changes have been made, but the replacement of the swing with the scooter is perhaps the clearest signal of how families have changed their habits regarding gifts for children.
Officials at the ONS have decided scooters have moved on from being a fad to become everyday items.
Last year, coffee pods and microwave rice were added to the basket, to reflect a long-term trend towards prepared foods.
Nightclub entry fees and rewriteable DVDs were among the items removed from the calculations.
