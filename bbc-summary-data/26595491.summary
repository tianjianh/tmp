[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster are anxiously waiting for an update on Ruan Pienaar's fitness after he sustained a shoulder injury in Friday's Pro12 win over the Scarlets.

Pienaar, 29, looked in some discomfort after Friday's game.
The South African underwent a scan on Saturday morning but an Ulster official said there was no news yet on the injury from their medical team.
Ulster's busy period of upcoming games include the Heineken Cup quarter-final against Saracens on 5 April.

Pienaar sustained the injury in the closing five minutes of the game and he was noticeably protecting his right arm and shoulder as he walked to the dressing-rooms after the final whistle.
Prop Callum Black could also be a doubt for Ulster's upcoming games after being carried off in the first half of Friday's 26-13 victory.
Black sustained an injury to his left leg and was also scheduled to undergo a scan over the weekend.
On the plus side for Ulster, Stephen Ferris returned after a 15-month absence as he was introduced in the 63rd minute of Friday's game.
The Ireland flanker made an immediate and trademark impact, driving Jordan Williams back 15 yards after the full-back caught a high ball.
Ulster are back in action in next Friday's Pro12 game against Edinburgh.
