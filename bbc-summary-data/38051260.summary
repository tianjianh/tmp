Alan Clarke, 57, from Norwich, backed four outsiders in races to beat odds of 570,000-1 at a shop in the city.
He said it was just "a little flutter", but, as reported in the Eastern Daily Press, Mr Clarke said it felt like "Christmas has come early".
He said he planned to replace his fridge-freezer, then renew his passport and book holidays in the US and Mexico.
The win was "the best pay day of my life" and a "life-changing amount", Mr Clarke said.

He placed bets in four races at Market Rasen and Wincanton on Thursday, backing horses at 25-1, two at 18-1 and one at 14-1.
His four-way accumulator, together with a special promotion at the Betfred shop which improved the odds, netted him £57,268.
Mr Clarke, who had followed the results on his phone, said he had to make a cup of coffee to calm himself down when the last horse on his betting slip crossed the finishing line.
