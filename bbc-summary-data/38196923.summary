Real Madrid's dramatic late equaliser against Barcelona "did not taste like a victory", said boss Zinedine Zidane.

Real extended their unbeaten start to the season to 22 games when captain Sergio Ramos pounced in stoppage-time to keep the leaders six points clear at the top of La Liga.
"It is just one point," said Zidane. "I don't know if the result is fair or not, but it is what it is.
"We got a point and it's not easy to do that here."
While Real are unbeaten since 6 April, defending champions Barca are without a league win in three.
Barcelona were moments away from cutting Real's lead at the top to three points when Ramos equalised.
Zidane said he did not believe the result would damage Barca's morale.
"We have a six-point lead, but it does not change anything," added the Frenchman. "We must keep working, this is a very long season.
"It is a good point, and we keep picking them up."
Real have one league game at home to Deportivo La Coruna before flying out to Japan to compete in the Club World Cup as European champions.
Zidane added: "What stands out for me is the work of the whole team.
"In the end, Sergio was there to score the goal. When they scored it lifted them.
"But we kept going and the heart of the team stood out again. We believed in ourselves again."
