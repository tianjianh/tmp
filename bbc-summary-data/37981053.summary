The former Germany captain, 32, has been allowed to negotiate potential moves with interested parties.
He is thought to be interested in joining an MLS side and met Chicago coach Veljko Paunovic over the weekend.
Schweinsteiger returned to first-team training after being forced to work on his own by Jose Mourinho.
However, it is not anticipated he will get a recall by the Red Devils manager.
Schweinsteiger, who joined United from Bayern Munich in a Â£14.4m deal in July 2015, has not played for the Premier League club since a 1-0 win at Manchester City in March, under Mourinho's predecessor Louis van Gaal.
He has made a total of 31 appearances for the club.
