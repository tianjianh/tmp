Greens to launch Scots council election manifesto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Greens are to launch their national manifesto for May's local authority elections.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Voters go to the polls on 4 May to elect local councils, and the Greens are fielding a record 218 candidates.
Party co-conveners Patrick Harvie and Maggie Chapman will set out their priorities for the elections at a launch event in Glasgow.
These are expected to centre on the protection of public services such as schools and social care.
In the last council elections in 2012, the Greens put forward 80 candidates, securing 14 council seats.
They are aiming to build on this total and the six MSPs won in the 2016 Holyrood elections with their largest-ever local election campaign.
Party groups in local authority areas will have their own local manifestos, but over-arching national priorities to be set out will include class sizes, better bus services, affordable housing and better wages for social care workers.
The party is also crowdfunding to raise money for a television party election broadcast.
The Green spring conference in March focused on "renewed local democracy in Scotland", where Mr Harvie said the "constitutional obsession" of other parties should not distract from local services.
He said: "Our job is simple - to build on the fantastic start that our former and existing councillors have achieved, building strong local economies that are healthy to live in, making the opportunities from the new greener industries into something everyone can access a reality for everyone, and renewing real local democracy."
Ms Chapman also told the conference that Green councillors could be "champions for change" in local government.
And MSP Andy Wightman said "genuine political and fiscal power should be in the hands of local communities".
He said: "Greens at council level are fighting hard to revitalise local democracy, pushing for every community to have a say in council budgets and for councils to have the powers other European towns and cities take for granted. While some other parties are shamefully treating the council elections as a proxy for constitutional issues, Greens are clear that local services matter, communities should be trusted to decide their future, and that local democracy is worth fighting for."
