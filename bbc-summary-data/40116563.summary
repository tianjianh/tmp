Michael Keogh, 37, was shot dead in an underground cark park on his way to work on Wednesday.
Detectives believe he is the latest victim of an ongoing feud between the Hutch and Kinahan gangs.
The man's body was discovered in a vehicle in a car park in Dorset Street with multiple gunshot wounds.
His body was found at 9:55 local time, two hours after a car was found on fire at nearby Clonliffe Avenue. Garda (Irish police) say a firearm was recovered in the vehicle.
Irish national broadcaster RTE is reporting that Garda believe Mr Keogh's killers may have followed his movements on  social media.
They are appealing for anyone in the area between 07:00 and 10:00 to come forward with any information they may have.
Increased patrols and additional armed checkpoints have been implemented amid fears of further retaliatory attacks.
The dispute between the rivals gangs is now believed to have led to the murders of at least 11 men - although two were cases of mistaken identity.
Many of the murders have taken place within Dublin's north inner city.
The first victim of the feud was Gary Hutch, who was shot dead in Spain in 2015.
In February 2016, gunmen dressed in police SWAT team uniforms opened fire inside a Dublin hotel while a boxing weigh-in was taking place, killing 33-year-old David Byrne, believed to be a member of the Kinahan gang.
