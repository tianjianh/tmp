A man, a woman and a baby girl died in the fire at Langley Mill in the early hours of Sunday morning.
It is believed the fire may have spread from a car parked outside flats.
"Police are not in a position to give any further details of those who died in the fire as they are still tracing family members," police said.
"Investigating officers say they are keeping an open mind as to the cause of the fire and have not ruled anything out at this early stage in the inquiry," police said.
Several neighbours said they heard an argument outside the flat on Saturday before the fire.
One resident of the property, Sean Needham, said he passed his six-year-old disabled son out of a window into his neighbour's arms.
Five of the occupants were taken to hospital for treatment and later released.
Several neighbouring properties were evacuated after the fire due to a gas leak caused by the blaze.
Neighbours said they used ladders to try to help rescue residents inside the house before emergency services arrived.
