[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He was the fourth person to be arrested and released during the investigation.
Mr Black, a 52-year-old father of two, was shot dead on the M1 as he drove to work at Maghaberry Prison on 1 November.
His funeral was held in his home town of Cookstown, County Tyrone, on Tuesday.
On Thursday,  detectives investigating the murder revisited the scene exactly one week after the attack.
Police mounted a number of checkpoints close to the M1. They spoke to motorists and gave them leaflets appealing for information.
Electronic signs ran a sequential message appealing for information.
At the Lurgan off-slip, a mobile appeal poster was positioned to reinforce appeal messages.
Police also stopped cars in the Annesborough Road area of Lurgan as part of inquiries to determine whether this was the getaway route used by the killers in their dark blue Toyota Camry car before it was found burnt out in the Inglewood district of the town.
