[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Memorial services have been held at Liverpool FC and at Liverpool Town Hall to mark the anniversary of the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

Ninety-six Liverpool fans died after being crushed at the Sheffield stadium on 15 April 1989.
Families of victims and thousands of fans attended the ticket-only service at Anfield which started at 14:45 BST.
Lord Mayor Frank Prendergast said the Town Hall service was a chance "to come together and remember those who died".
At 15:06 - the time Liverpool's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest was called off 23 years ago - the bells at the Town Hall rang 96 times to commemorate each victim.
A minute's silence was also held at Anfield.
Mr Prendergast said: "It was an opportunity to come together and remember those who died and remind people that it can never be allowed to happen again."
