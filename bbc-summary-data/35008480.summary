Six people died and 15 others were injured when the lorry went out of control on 22 December 2014 after the driver, Harry Clarke, 58, blacked out.
The inquiry, before Sheriff John Beckett, examined the circumstances of the tragedy over five weeks of evidence at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Beckett's determination will be issued at 12:00 on Monday.
The announcement, by the Judiciary of Scotland on Twitter, stated: "Glasgow Bin Lorry FAI: Determination to be issued at 12 noon on Monday 7 December 2015. A summary will be available from 11.30 on Monday."
The inquiry was convened after the Crown Office said it would not prosecute anyone over the crash - a highly controversial decision that was defended by Scotland's top law officer, the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland.
The FAI examined Mr Clarke's health, the bin lorry vehicle and the route it took on the day of the crash.
During evidence, it emerged that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the wheel of the Glasgow City Council bin lorry when it veered out of control on Queen Street.
Just 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, with six people dead and 15 injured.
The FAI heard that Mr Clarke suffered an earlier blackout at the wheel of a stationary bus in 2010 and that this episode, and his history of dizziness and other ailments, were not disclosed to Glasgow City Council and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
In his evidence, Mr Clarke refused to apologise and answer all questions put to him as it emerged he may face a private prosecution from some of the bereaved families.
He was later suspended from his council job and resigned before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing.
Mr Clarke later issued a statement to the BBC stating that he apologised "unreservedly" for his role in the tragedy.
Those killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.
