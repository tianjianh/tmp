Officers were called to an address at Penygroes in the early hours of Monday after being alerted by the Welsh Ambulance Service.
The baby was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital at Bangor where she died. North Wales Police said the death was being treated as unexplained.
The force said two people had been arrested on suspicion of assault.
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said paramedics were called to reports of a medical emergency at about 04:40 BST, sending one rapid response vehicle and two emergency ambulances.
A post mortem examination was carried out at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool on Tuesday.
North West Wales coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said he had asked a forensic pathologist and a paediatric pathologist to take part in the post mortem examination.
"A lot of tests have been carried out and it will be some considerable time before I receive all the results," he said.
