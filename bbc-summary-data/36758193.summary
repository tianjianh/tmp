The Colossus at Thorpe Park, Surrey, was halted when staff saw on CCTV that someone had "ignored restrictions". Riders were walked to safety.
"We e-stopped the ride as soon as possible and evacuated all guests," a spokeswoman said.
No-one was hurt and the Colossus was "back up and running" a short time later.
