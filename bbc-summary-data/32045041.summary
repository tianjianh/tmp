James Corden's accent was never a worry, says US show producer

The rumours that James Corden needed to change his accent for his new US TV show were "ridiculous", his producer says.

Speaking to Newsbeat from the US, Ben Winston says that the reports "were really weird and came from nowhere".
"The idea that America struggles to understand English people is a slightly odd idea considering the amount of English actors," he says.
"I don't think anyone's worried about his [Corden's] voice at all."
Corden's first night on The Late Late Show on Monday, has generally been considered a success.
"They say you should never read reviews and you try not to, because you have to take them with a pinch of salt because, well, they could be terrible tomorrow," Winston says.
"But I have seen them and it's exciting. They've been so kind and lovely and really seemed to enjoy the show."
Unlike pretty much every other chat show host in the US, Corden does not sit behind a desk, despite trying one out in rehearsal.
"It was strange because he felt too far away," says Winston.
As soon as he came out from behind the desk though, "it just felt right".
The first set of guests on the show were high profile stars, Tom Hanks and Mila Kunis, and Winston says viewers can expect a lot more big names on the programme.
"I hope we get One Direction on the show. They're not in America now until the summer, so I don't think they're going to come on any time soon," says Winston, who has worked with the singers before, on their This is Us film.
"But we've got David Beckham on Monday. We've got Simon Cowell the week after, so we're definitely having our British contingent."
