The 23-year-old European Tour rookie, world-ranked 469, shot a five-under-par 68 at Barseback Golf and Country Club.
Welsh pair Jamie Donaldson and Bradley Dredge are both just one shot behind after the opening round.
"It was tough out there, a lot of swirling winds which made it difficult judging clubs, but I managed to put a good score together," Orrin said.

Donaldson's opening round 69 belied his recent form - he has just one top-10 finish in the last 17 months - while Dredge's strong show came in the week he qualified for his first US Open at the age of 43.
Open champion and Barseback member Henrik Stenson carded a level-par 73 while fellow Swede and world top 10 player Alex Noren - fresh from winning the PGA Championship - finished two over on 75.
