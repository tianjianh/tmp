The 25-year-old midfielder, on loan from Crystal Palace until the end of the season, scored in the Royals' 2-2 draw at Ipswich on Saturday.
"I haven't played regularly now for about two years and I'm looking forward to getting on and proving people wrong and myself right," Mutch said.
"There's plenty of games to go and I want to show people what I can do."
Mutch was one of three transfer deadline-day loan arrivals at the Madejski Stadium, along with striker Lewis Grabban and defender Reece Oxford.
The former QPR player is hoping to play a key role in Reading's push for the Premier League under the possession-based style of manager Jaap Stam.
"I'm so impressed with how well organised we are on the ball," Mutch told BBC Radio Berkshire. "It's a simple style with a lot of thought process going into it.
"The players are in sync with what the manager wants to do. It's been really easy to come into the team and I can't wait for it to continue."
