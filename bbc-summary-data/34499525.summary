As the country celebrated the team reaching their first major football tournament since 1958, thoughts also turned to the man credited with starting it all.
Speed died in 2011 while managing Wales. His successor Coleman said he was always in the team's thoughts.
Speed's father also spoke of his pride.
Despite losing 2-0 in their crunch match against Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday, Wales qualified for Euro 2016 after Israel lost to Cyprus.
Tributes to Speed flooded in on social media after Wales' qualification, including a message from former England captain David Beckham.
Writing on Instagram, accompanied by a picture Speed during his playing days, he said: "This man would have been so proud tonight... Congratulations to Chris Colman all the players and everyone involved in welsh football..."
Coleman took over from Speed, who had had a run of wins with the Welsh team.
Speaking after Saturday's game in Zenica, Coleman said he would be ringing Speed's parents, Roger and Carol, to congratulate them.
"I will be raising a glass to my good friend Gary Speed, obviously who is no longer with us but always in my thoughts - our thoughts," he added.
He said when he took the job after Speed's death he was in a "sticky situation".
"Gary Speed was such a great man and a great presence that I wanted to carry on his work. But I couldn't," Coleman said.
"So I decided to do my own thing and it has been a fantastic campaign. Gary Speed played his part and I'm sure he is smiling tonight."
Gary Speed's father, Roger, has spoken of his pride in his son.
I'm absolutely delighted Wales have finally done it. And it gives me immense pride that Gary's name has been mentioned - by the players and the fans - so often along the way in this qualifying campaign.
"I was down in Cardiff for the draw against Israel last month and I've never experienced an atmosphere like it. The fans started singing Gary's favourite song - I Can't Take My Eyes Off You - and then chanted his name. It really got to me. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I was in tears.
"Watching this team has given me so much pleasure and Chris Coleman deserves a huge amount of credit for what he's achieved. It was so difficult for him to follow Gary but he's done a great job. The spirit in the side is something very special.
"I'm actually an Englishman, born in Chester. But Gary's influence has certainly turned me into a Wales fan - I look out for their result before England's these days. I've always got a daffodil inside my coat pocket. And there's no doubt about it, I'll be in France to support them next summer.
"Like a few of the players have already mentioned, qualification is a fitting tribute to what Gary put in place with this group of players. There's no doubt he would be immensely proud of their success. I know he's been watching from above and cheering the team on. I'd like to think he's been an inspiration."
Former Wales striker and pundit John Hartson said: "When Gary was taken away from us, the whole country was in mourning and these players were realty affected by it. So for Chris to have come in and picked the team up and to have moved forward the way they have has been magnificent."
Fellow former Wales player and pundit Robbie Savage tweeted:  "And let's not forget the legend Gary speed who put the belief back into our nation."
Welsh Conservative leader tweeted his congratulations to the Wales team, adding: "Also shouldn't forget the role Gary Speed had in the development of this team - a special Welshman."
Speaking to the BBC before the match, Wales forward Hal Robson-Kanu said he believed that qualification would be the perfect tribute to Speed, whom he credited with affecting significant changes to Welsh international football.
"Before that there wasn't really a desire to win, to be the best, and to do as well as you can. But Speedo really implemented that."
