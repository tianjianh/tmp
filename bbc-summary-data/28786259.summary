Plans to redevelop Manchester Business School, which include a bridge being removed and pavements widened, have been unveiled.

The proposals, which will see work on the existing retail precinct area of the school, are part of a Â£50m revamp.
The University of Manchester said the plans would bring "improved teaching facilities and a new learning library".
It would be the second phase of work, following the building of a hotel and education centre in the coming months.
Developers Bruntwood said the "creation of a vibrant retail and leisure offer" at the Oxford Road site was vital.
"At the moment, there is very little retail or leisure provision between the city centre and Whitworth Park.
"We are confident demand for this location will see it become a thriving new destination in Manchester."
Subject to planning permission being granted, the work will begin in 2015. The whole project is due to be completed in early 2018.
