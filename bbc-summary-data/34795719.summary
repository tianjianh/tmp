India-Pakistan Diwali diplomacy offers new hope for ties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
While people in India are celebrating Diwali with traditional zeal, the festival of lights seems to have augured well in more ways than one.

There are signs that the festival has brought about a long-awaited thaw in relations between the two neighbours as Indian and Pakistan forces exchanged sweets on the Wagah/Attari border.
India's Border Security Force (BSF) commandant Bipul Bir Gussain handed a basket of sweets to Pakistan Rangers' Wing Commander Lt Col Bilal Ahmad.
According to media reports, troops from both sides also embraced and exchanged Diwali greetings. This small gesture of goodwill between Pakistani and Indian troops is seen as a significant development in the wake of strained bilateral relations.
It has come at a time when relations between the Pakistan and India are at their lowest, with allegations of ceasefire violations and involvement in terrorism from both sides.
Planned talks between national security advisers from India and Pakistan were cancelled in August hours before they were due to start, dashing hopes that the two nuclear-armed neighbours might tackle the issue of growing violence on borders.
Last year, the tense border situation meant that no exchange of sweets took place at Diwali, Eid, or even independence day celebrations. Guards on both sides kept their distance while the gates remained closed.
The exchange of sweets is not the only sign of a thaw in relations between India and Pakistan.
Geeta, the hearing and speech-impaired Indian girl, who accidentally took a train that had crossed the border into the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore 10 years ago, was returned to India last week, amid much fanfare and hype which one Pakistani daily termed "Geeta diplomacy".
On meeting Geeta, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Pranab Mukherjee described her as "a symbol of India-Pakistan unity.
This was followed by a visit to Karachi by the Indian high commissioner to Pakistan, TCA Raghavan. There he met Razia Sattar, the mother of Ramzan, a 15-year old Pakistani boy who had been reported missing and is now living with a non-government organization in the Indian city of Bhopal.
On meeting Ms Sattar at a hotel in Karachi, Mr Raghavan assured her that a visa allowing her to visit her son would be issued as soon as she arranged a passport.
India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj was keen to publicise this overture.
In a bid to capitalize on the goodwill brought about by Geeta's repatriation, the Pakistani government has also responded positively to conciliatory moves from India by inviting Ms Swaraj to an important conference on the future of Afghanistan to be held in Islamabad.
The two-day 'Heart of Asia' conference on the Afghan issue will commence begin on 7 December with representatives from Azerbaijan, China, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and the UAE.
