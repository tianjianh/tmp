[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jacques Rudolph will continue as captain of Glamorgan in 2017 despite disappointing form in 2016.

The county have confirmed the South African batsman will lead the county for a third consecutive season.
"The way he led the side, the respect he has, is really important" said Glamorgan chief Hugh Morris.
And batsman Colin Ingram is due to make a first-class comeback shortly after 11 months' absence from the longer format because of a knee injury.
Glamorgan reached the T20 Blast quarter-final in 2016, but slipped to eighth in Division Two of the Championship.
Rudolph is being backed for a return to form after scoring 659 runs at an average of 24 in the four-day game.
"By his own admission Jacques had a really disappointing season," said Morris.
"But he's been 19 seasons in first-class cricket, we all have bad seasons, and he's really excited about coming back to Glamorgan for 2017.
"There won't be anyone trying harder than Jacques to regain form and provide some success for the club.
"The way we've performed in white-ball cricket over the last two years, we've been really competitive."
Ingram return due
South Africa batsman Colin Ingram is due to return to first-class cricket with the Warriors in the next few weeks after 11 months out of the four-day game.
Ingram impressed in limited-overs cricket but could not play in the Championship because of a knee injury, which needed an operation in August 2016.
He has since played T20 cricket in South Africa but is yet to make his comeback in the longer format.
"He is spending time on strength and conditioning and is focussing on that, and he is due to play some four-day cricket before he comes across to Glamorgan," explained Morris.
"We're very comfortable with the way he's going, he's due to be playing before the end of January."
Batsman/wicket-keeper Chris Cooke is also expected to be fully fit, after missing half the 2016 season with back trouble.
De Lange talks
Glamorgan are still in talks with South African fast bowler Marchant de Lange, who could be signed for the whole 2017 season.
"We've had conversations with Marchant's agents and those are ongoing," Morris confirmed.
Young Glamorgan batsmen Aneurin Donald, Nick Selman and Kiran Carlson, along with spinner Kieran Bull, are currently playing club cricket in Australia.
All-rounder Craig Meschede is playing club cricket in his native South Africa, while Glamorgan's other home-based players have resumed net sessions in Cardiff.
The county's opening first-class game is against Cardiff MCCU starting on 28 March, while the Championship campaign begins away to Northamptonshire on 7 April.
