The Belgian club said they were in talks with the Blues over the 18-year-old's possible sale last month,
However, while Villas-Boas praised Belgian international Lukaku, he insisted the club did not need to strengthen their attack.
"To bring in another forward, at the moment I don't think we will," said the Portuguese.
We need to find the correct balance and this is why pre-season is important
"Lukaku had a magnificent season in Belgium. We are pondering every decision because we don't want to go into the market and make mistakes.
"We have plenty of availability in terms of forwards who can play in different positions - with [Nicolas] Anelka, with [Salomon] Kalou, Didier [Drogba], [Fernando] Torres and [Daniel] Sturridge.
"This is the reality at the moment of our squad. We need to find the correct balance and this is why pre-season is important."
Lukaku, widely regarded as one of the most promising talents in European football, would reportedly cost in the region of Â£18m.
The 6ft 4in frontman, whose contract runs out in 2013, is a strong and committed striker who is often referred to as 'the new Didier Drogba'.
Lukaku scored 15 league goals in 2009/10 to help Anderlecht win the Jupiler League title, while last season he scored 16 goals from 37 appearances as his side finished third.
