The Tickle the Ivories festival, now in its fourth year, has seen six pianos positioned around the city centre for public use.
Those who step up to the keys are licensed to busk, meaning they can keep whatever proceeds they make.
The festival, which is run in conjunction with Open Culture Liverpool, continues until 7 September.
