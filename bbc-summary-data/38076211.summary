Among the least successful films of the year is Snowden, directed by Oliver Stone, alongside Sacha Baron Cohen's Grimsby, according to Forbes.
Sci-fi film Max Steel, which returned 42% of its budget, tops its Hollywood's Biggest Turkeys of 2016 list.
Period drama and horror mash-up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies also features in the top 10.
Snowden, telling the story of whistleblower Edward Snowden's leak of US intelligence, is ranked ninth in the list, which compares worldwide box office totals with the estimated film budgets.
The film, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, has received good reviews but made it to ninth on the list, taking 86% of its $40m (£32m) budget. It is yet to be released in the UK.
Free State of Jones, in which Matthew McConaughey plays an American Civil War fighter, returned less than half of its $50m (£40m) budget, making it second on the list.
In fourth position was comedy Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, starring Lily James and Matt Smith, which made back 58% of its $28m (£23m) budget, followed by computer-animated Ratchet & Clank, which took $11.8m (£9.5m), having had an estimated budget of $20m (£16m).
Comedy action film Grimsby - known as The Brothers Grimsby in the US - is estimated to have had a $35m (£28m) budget. It took $28.7m (£23m) at the international box office, making it the worst box office total of Baron Cohen's career. It was eighth on the list.
Natalie Robehmed of Forbes said that "not all movies flopped because they were bad films", noting that several were well received by critics.
She said: "Movies underperform for a number of reasons, be it marketing, release date timing, poor reviews or a combination of several factors."
Forbes only included films that opened in more than 2,000 cinemas and did not look at those released this month.
