Sometimes the best advice can come from a fresh pair of eyes. It is hard to get much fresher than primary seven pupils in south Belfast.

The P7 pundits dished out words of wisdom on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme during the last leg of Northern Ireland's Euro 2016 campaign.
After qualification was secured, the Fane Street Primary School pupils took their tips on leadership, communication and positive attitudes to the top.
They joined manager Michael O'Neill and captain Steven Davis at Windsor Park on Sunday.
The youngsters watched training ahead of Monday's friendly against Slovenia. Patrick told Michael O'Neill the team's defence needed "some work" before the Euro 2016 tournament.
"Shooting was great but they need more defence," Patrick advised.
Mr O'Neill said that when they play Germany, the team will focus on their defence. "We'll work on that between now and the summer," he added.
Reece advised players who were not getting enough game time in their clubs to practise in their gardens at home.
"Play football in the garden and you will get more fit. Or you could run outside. If you have a son or daughter, go to the park and play with them."
Mr O'Neill said the advice was "excellent".
"I'm not sure too many of them go out in their garden," he added.
"All the players have a responsibility to stay fit, and you're right sometimes they are not maybe getting the required game time at their clubs, so there is an onus on them to maintain their own personal fitness. And to be fair, they've all been very good. The players this week in camp, the fitness levels are great and they are all very keen to make sure they get the opportunity to go to France."
Maison told the pair "it's not all about scoring".
"If we win we win, if we lose we lose. It doesn't really matter. We're through to the Euros."
Maison also told Northern Ireland captain Davis that his leadership would be crucial to the team in France this summer.  He told the Southampton midfielder to "motivate" and "communicate" with his teammates.
Jack said younger players in the team should be made to feel welcome. He told Davis it was up to more senior players like himself to help new squad members settle in.
"Pass the ball to them and give them a chance to score," he added.
Jack said if they were given opportunities, they would become better players.
The P7 pundits can be heard on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme at 17:00 BST on Monday 28 March.
