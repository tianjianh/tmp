[SN]TITLE[SN]
Send us your nativity play photos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's Christmas, so at school it can mean only one thing - it's time for nativity plays!

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Are you taking part in a nativity play or Christmas show at school before term ends?
Have you made a costume, decorations or props for it?
We want your photos of them!
Thanks for your pictures, this page is now closed. It will re-open tomorrow morning.
You must ask your parent, teacher or guardian for permission before you send us a picture or video.
We may show your picture or video on our website or in our TV bulletins. We'll show your first name and which town you're from - but we won't use your details for anything else.
