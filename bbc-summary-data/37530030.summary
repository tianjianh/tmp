Corrie Mckeague, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, was last seen in Bury St Edmunds following a night out.
CCTV images show the 23-year-old, believed to be from Dunfermline, Fife, walking through the streets of the town after he left friends.
His uncle Tony Wringe said his nephew kept in close contact with his family.
"He is a real fun guy. He is so close to his family and friends so this is out of character. He has a strong family support network," said Mr Wringe.
He added the family was finding it "hard to deal with the uncertainty. That is the most difficult thing".
Officers, supported by the RAF, Suffolk Lowland Search and Rescue and the National Police Air Service helicopter, have been continuing to look for Mr Mckeague.
He has not been seen since about 03:20 BST last Saturday.
On Friday officers continued the search between Bury St Edmunds and Honington and said that over the weekend these ground searches will be expanded.
Officers are also continuing to go through CCTV footage in a bid to find any sightings that may take the investigation forward.
Anyone with information is asked to call Suffolk Police.
