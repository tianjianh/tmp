Craig Charles is quitting Coronation Street in September after 10 years, to revive his role in Red Dwarf.

The space sitcom, which started out on the BBC in 1988, is returning for two new series on digital channel Dave.
Charles took a sabbatical from the ITV soap in 2011 when Red Dwarf was revived once before, but this time there are no plans for his return.
Charles said: "I have had an absolutely fantastic 10 years on Coronation Street and I will be very sad to leave."
He said his character Lloyd "has become a huge part of my life and I have made some amazing friends with whom I will always keep in touch.
"But I feel I owe it to my colleagues on Red Dwarf to join them in filming the new series and finding out what is in store for Lister and the others. I would love to return to Coronation Street at some point in the future."
Red Dwarf, which sees Charles play a stranded space technician, ran for eight series on the BBC, and was later revived by Dave in 2009 and 2012.
The new series will once again star Chris Barrie as Rimmer, Danny John-Jules as Cat and Robert Llewellyn as Kryten, and will air from next year.
Coronation Street producer Stuart Blackburn said: "Craig has provided us with a decade packed with laughter, tears and great drama. We wish him all the best."
