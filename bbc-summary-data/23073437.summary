The utility reported that 99.88% of samples taken in 2012/13 complied with strict quality standards.
It also achieved its best customer satisfaction score on record, exceeding its target by 5%.
Last year, the corporation invested ??487m in water infrastructure projects.
They included major waste water projects in Airdrie and Dunoon, as well as new water treatment works on Unst in Shetland.
Scottish Water recently announced other large investments, including a ??5.7m project to improve the quality of drinking water on the Isle of Mull which is due to begin by early October.
It also plans to invest ??250m in upgrading Glasgow's waste water network.
Scottish Water chief executive Douglas Millican said he was committed to maintaining the pace of improvement in achieving the highest customer service standards across Scotland.
Mr Millican, who took up his role in February, added: "Scottish Water has continued to go from strength to strength in the last year as we deliver the best value water and waste water services in Great Britain.
"Drinking water quality is at its highest ever level, customer service has improved further, and we are delivering efficient investment in Scotland's water and waste water infrastructure - supporting thousands of construction jobs across Scotland in the process."
Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish Water had shown a strong performance last year, building on the excellent progress that it had made in recent years.
She added: "It illustrates the ability of the public sector to deliver excellence and develop our water resource.
"Scottish Water is providing a high quality service to its customers for an average household charge that is ??54 lower than in England and Wales.
"I am delighted with this performance that reflects the commitment of Scottish Water's management and staff to delivery of these essential services to our communities across Scotland."
