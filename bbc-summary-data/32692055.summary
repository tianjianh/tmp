Cheltenham have signed former Torquay defender Aaron Downes and ex-Charlton midfielder Jack Munns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Downes, 29, left Plainmoor last month following a three-year stay, during which time he made 115 appearances, scoring 16 times.
Munns, 21, was out of contract at Charlton having not made appearance for the Championship club.
