Husband 'told police about dead wife' before own death

A man called police to tell them where to find his dead wife before his body was found in a car crash 200 miles away, police have said.

The woman's body was found in a house in Mill Green, Wolverhampton, in the early hours of Thursday.
Her husband was found dead a short time later after "a single car collision" in Dover, West Midlands Police said.
Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths of the couple, who were both in their 60s.
Det Insp Warren Hines said post-mortem examinations will take place in due course.
