Murderer charged with absconding from Stirling prison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted murderer has appeared in court charged with absconding from prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amy Stewart is alleged to have failed to return to Cornton Vale prison in Stirling after a period of home leave on Thursday, 2 July.
The 31-year-old made no plea or declaration to charges that she "absconded and did attempt to defeat the ends of justice".
The case at Stirling Sheriff Court was continued to a full hearing next week.
Papers from the court alleged that having been sentenced to life in prison for murder in February 2004, Stewart "failed to comply" with the conditions of her temporary release licence between 25 June and 3 July.
She was remanded in custody.
