[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recycling efforts by four Welsh councils will be boosted by an extra £3m to help them meet higher targets.

Flintshire, Neath Port Talbot, Newport and Wrexham won their bids for cash for new vehicles, depots and equipment.
Of the four, only Newport failed to hit the target of recycling 52% of rubbish in 2014 but the target is now 58%.
Natural Resources Minister Carl Sargeant said the aim was to achieve a "more consistent universal service across Wales".
Merthyr Tydfil and Rhondda Cynon Taff were the worst performers in 2013-14, both recycling less than half of all rubbish they collected.
