Raised By Wolves, which was written by Caitlin Moran and her sister Caroline and based on their upbringing, was shelved by Channel 4 after two series.
It was one of a number of UK winners at the Berlin ceremony, which drew its nominees from across Europe.
BBC Two's Inside No 9, written by and starring Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, was named best comedy.
In other categories:
John Cleese was honoured with a lifetime achievement award for his outstanding contribution to the entertainment industry.
In his acceptance speech, Cleese said television executives and channel controllers should place more faith in writers and performers to deliver success.
He said: "When Monty Python was commissioned, we didn't really know what we were going to do but we were trusted. The talent has a better record than the suits, so why don't they bear that in mind?
"The trouble with executives isn't that they have no idea what they are doing, but that they have no idea that they have no idea."
Non-British winners included Swedish public service broadcaster SVT, which won the entertainment prize for the Eurovision Song Contest 2016.
The ceremony was hosted by BBC radio presenter Paddy O'Connell.
The Rose d'Or Awards were established in 1961, honour the best online content and radio and TV shows from the previous year. The awards are open to submissions from around the world.
The UK has triumphed in the best sitcom category every year since the awards began, with winners including Friday Night Dinner, Peep Show, Extras, The IT Crowd and The Inbetweeners.
