Barry Ferguson says Pedro Caixinha is a hands-on manager who will look to control everything around Rangers' team but still hopes to be his assistant.

The former Rangers midfielder is one of several candidates the new manager has interviewed for the role.
"He's obviously clearly got a way he wants to play," Ferguson told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
"He plans training out. He decides on virtually everything from training, to the warm-up into the possession games."
Caixinha, who joined Rangers after leaving Qatari club Al-Gharafa earlier this month, spent time in Scotland previously on a coaching course.
But he said on his arrival at Ibrox that he would wish an assistant with local knowledge.
Ferguson, who resigned as Clyde manager in February, has been interviewed along with fellow former Rangers players Peter Lovenkrands, Alex Rae, Jonatan Johansson and John Brown.
"It was an interesting meeting because he's a foreign coach with his own ideas about the way he wants to play," he said.
"The meeting went fine, but I know there's about another four or five guys been in since, so I have not heard anything since last Wednesday."
