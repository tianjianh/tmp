Chris Higgins scored the opener for the visitors midway through the first period at Altrincham Ice Centre.
It was quickly followed by a Storm equaliser from Trevor Johnson before Matt Nickerson netted the winner with nine minutes left in the game.
The Giants, who beat Sheffield Steelers by the same scoreline on Saturday, remain second in the standings.
Jackson Whistle started consecutive games with Ryan Martinelli missing Sunday's game through injury.
Belfast dominated the opening period , outshooting the Storm 10-5 with Mike Clemente the busier of the two netminders.
Higgins netted at 11:32, assisted by Mark Garside and Michael Forney, before Johnson scored on a powerplay at 13:35.
The second period was scoreless as both Whistle and Clemente kept the scores level in a finely poised tie.
Finally, at 50:21, the Giants got the all important go-ahead goal - Nickerson, assisted by Mark Garside and Alex Foster, finished beautifully.
The Giants closed out the game in a professional manner to seal the win and avenge last month's 5-1 defeat against the same opposition.
The teams meet again at the same venue on Wednesday night in the Challenge Cup quarter-final first leg.
