Lopez, 23, won a unanimous points decision against 20-year-old Melikuziev in a repeat of last year's World Championships final.
It is Cuba's third boxing gold medal at Rio 2016.
Azerbaijan's Kamran Shakhsuvarly and Mexico's Misael Rodriguez took the bronze medals as losing semi-finalists.
Richie Woodhall, former WBC super-middleweight champion:
"Lopez is a talent. He can box at range or on the inside. He has great balance and accuracy. He was a deserved winner."
Anthony Joshua, 2012 Olympic super-heavyweight champion:
"That was a really tight fight. First round I thought 'hang on' but Lopez seemed to find his range and distance and started building round by round."
