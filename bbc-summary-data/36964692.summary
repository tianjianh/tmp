Mark Clattenburg: Champions League & Euro 2016 tattoos for referee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg now has a permanent reminder of taking charge of 2016's biggest football matches.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 41-year-old officiated at May's Champions League final as Real Madrid beat Atletico Madrid on penalties, and was then chosen to referee the Euro 2016 final as Portugal beat France in extra-time in July.
To mark the landmarks in his career, Clattenburg had two tattoos inked on his arm while in Spain - one of the Euro 2016 logo and another of the Champions League trophy with 'Final Milano 2016' written underneath.
Tattooist Mick Mahon posted photographs of her work on Facebook and wrote: "It's not every Sunday you get to tattoo the world's top football referee... Mark Clattenburg back for more!"
