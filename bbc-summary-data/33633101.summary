It happened at about 07:30 GMT on Thursday when a car crashed into the wall of St Eithne's primary school on the Springtown Road.
Police arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of driving while unfit and dangerous driving.
An 18-year-old man was arrested for taking a car without consent, driving while unfit and criminal damage.
SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack said: "It is extremely fortunate that school was out and there were no children on their way to class or this could have been so much worse.
"This area has been plagued by joyriders and those responsible for this reckless and irresponsible action should face the full extent of the law."
