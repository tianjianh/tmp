[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee have signed striker Arturo Juan Rodríguez Pérez-Reverte on loan from Cordoba until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old impressed during a trial period at Dens Park last week.
Arturo earned a move to Cordoba after a prolific 2013-14 campaign with La Roda in the Spanish third tier.
"We are delighted to have him on board," manager Paul Hartley told the club website. "We look forward to working with him and feel he will be a good addition to the squad."
Arturo will not be considered for Friday's visit to Aberdeen.
