Twitter erupted when tennis ace Andy Murray clinched victory after a tense four-hour final match against Argentinean Juan Martin del Potro.
Murray's mum Judy Murray found a familiar face on the telly when she tuned into Olympics coverage on BBC Breakfast. She may not have enjoyed her mother's special guest appearance.
Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh also stayed up to watch the gripping tennis final and was quick to congratulate Murray.
Also tuning at 01:00 BST was First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who called medal-winner Murray a "legend" and a "superstar".
Fellow Scottish Olympian Chris Hoy was also up in the wee hours cheering on Murray.
Scotland's cyclists have had lots of success at the Rio Games. Along with teammates Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Elinor Barker, Scot Katie Archibald pedalled her way to an Olympic gold, and her posts shows that the team have been scouring Twitter looking for reactions.
Edinburgh council gave Scots silver medal winner Callum Skinner a special shout-out.
James Guy and Scots Duncan Scott, Stephen Milne and Dan Wallace took home the silver for the Men's 4 x 100 Medley Relay in Rio. Afterwards, Wallace posted some sweet snaps on Twitter of his family playing with the medals, with the caption This is why I do it.
Four-time Olympic medallist Rebecca Adlington voiced her support for the "incredible" men's relay swimming team.
After she earned her record-breaking fifth Olympic medal, social media was ablaze with admiration for rower Katherine Grainger. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson shared a thoughtful comment from Grainger about life after she leaves rowing behind.
Google pointed that after Grainger's silver win, she became a more popular search term than Harry Potter character Hermione Granger. Potter author JK Rowling was one of the many Twitter users to re-tweet this.
Clare Balding was also clearly moved by Katherine Grainger and rowing partner Vicky Thornley's story.
Heather Stanning, who lives in Lossiemouth, rowed her way to a gold medal alongside rowing partner Helen Glover. Afterwards, she took to Instagram to thank everyone for their support and to show the world her new bling.
Rowing partner Glover shared this image of the sheer tension felt by their mums during the race.
The stress seemed to spread to Judy Murray, who had a bottle of wine handy to ease the tension.
Scottish rugby celebrated the successes of two of their own: silver medal winners Mark Bennett and Mark Robertson.
Mark Robertson posted a picture on Instagram with his teammates after the silver win, calling the experience an unbelievable journey.
Greg McHugh, the actor behind Gary: Tank Commander, was one of the many catching Olympic fever.
