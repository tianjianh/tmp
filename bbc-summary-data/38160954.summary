Stirling-based Superglass, which it bought in the summer, will host a new regional headquarters.
It will focus on new business opportunities in the US, as well as the UK and Ireland.
TechnoNicol said an unspecified number of new jobs are likely to be created in Stirling as the new HQ takes shape.
Currently 150 people work at the Stirling base.
The group, which has more than 50 production centres globally, said it saw "considerable opportunities" in the construction products and accessories market in the UK and the US.
In addition to growing its presence in the UK and Ireland, the company said it aimed to establish "a significant market share" in North America over the next five years.
Superglass chief executive Ken Munro has been appointed chief executive of the new regional division, TechnoNicol (UK, Ireland & USA).
Mr Munro will manage and co-ordinate TechnoNicol's presence in the three countries.
He will also continue to lead the Superglass business in Stirling as it is incorporated into the new regional structure.
TechnoNicol said Mr Munro would have responsibility for the global development of the Superglass brand, which includes glass wool and mineral fibre insulation products.
Mr Munro said: "The integration of Superglass into the TechnoNicol family represents a significant step forward in the development of our business and opens up new opportunities, both for our people and our customers.
"I look forward to leading the integrated business across these geographies and to managing the expansion of Superglass as a key insulation brand within it."
