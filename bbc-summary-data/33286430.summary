SAS selection deaths: Coroner ruling in July

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The findings of an inquest into the deaths of three army reservists who were on an SAS selection exercise will not be known for another three weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
L/Cpl Craig Roberts, from Conwy county, died during the Brecon Beacons march on one of the hottest days of 2013.
L/Cpl Edward Maher and Cpl James Dunsby also collapsed and later died.
On Friday, coroner Louise Hunt told the inquest which has been sitting for four weeks that she intends to make her findings known on 14 July.
The men died after suffering heat exhaustion during an SAS reservist exercise in July 2013.
The closing submissions at the hearing in Solihull, West Midlands, raised the issue of whether the coroner could consider a verdict of unlawful killing.
Other issues of consideration include whether there was a gross failure on the part of the Ministry of Defence in ensuring that the exercise was done safely.
