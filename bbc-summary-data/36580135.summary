England's third Test against Australia in Sydney on Saturday is "like a World Cup final", says coach Eddie Jones.

England have beaten the Wallabies in Brisbane and Melbourne to establish an unassailable 2-0 lead and achieve their first series win down under.
It means Jones' side have climbed up three places to second in the world rankings, behind New Zealand.
"To win a World Cup, you have to win three big games in a row," said the Australia-born coach, 56.
"The quarter-final, semi-final and then the final. It's a great dress rehearsal for us."
Jones has set his sights on catching the All Blacks, who won the World Cup last year.
He added: "It's good for world rugby that England are strong. New Zealand have been up there all the time and it's about time someone put a real challenge on them and we are going to be the side that do that.
"We have massive areas we need to improve - the consistency of our line-out, the breakdown and we need to develop our attack.
"We can do that over the next three years to take us on the road we want to go. There isn't a schedule."
