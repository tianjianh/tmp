The 20-year-old, who is yet to play for the Magpies first team, signed his first professional contract with the Premier League club in 2015.
He made his league debut during a two-month loan spell last season with Blackpool, where he played eight times.
Smith will be available for the Alex up to and including their League Two game with Mansfield Town on 7 January.
He is the third player signed by Crewe boss Steve Davis this summer, following experienced strikers Ryan Lowe and Chris Dagnall.
Smith will hope to emulate the success of another Newcastle loanee Brad Inman, who moved to Gresty Road as a 20-year-old in November 2012 before signing permanently the following August.
Inman was the Alex's top scorer in League One last term before leaving for Peterborough this summer.
