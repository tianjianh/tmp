With the death toll rising to 84, police spokesman Dhananjay Kulkarni said it was the worst incident of its kind in the city in more than a decade.
He says more than 30 people are still in hospital, some in serious condition.
Toxic alcohol deaths are a regular occurrence in India, where people often drink cheap bootleg liquor.
Residents of the Malad slum area fell ill after drinking cheap homemade alcohol on Wednesday. Police reportedly found eight sick people after a door-to-door search for more potential victims.
Five people have been arrested on charges of distributing and selling the alcohol, while eight police personnel were also reportedly suspended for suspected negligence following the incident.
Tayra Khan, wife of one of the victims, told Mumbai's Mid-Day newspaper that her husband was admitted to hospital early on Thursday after "he complained of vomiting and pain in the stomach".
"He died three hours later, leaving me and my three little children alone."
At least 29 people were killed after consuming toxic alcohol in Uttar Pradesh state in January.
India has witnessed many other incidents of toxic alcohol deaths in the past:
