[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who sexually assaulted a teenager and raped a woman while they were sleeping has been jailed for six years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren McCutcheon, 31, from Springburn, Glasgow, was convicted of attacking the 17-year-old at a house in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, in December 2012.
He was also found guilty of raping the second victim at a different address in the town on 19 April last year.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, McCutcheon was also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.
Jailing him, judge Lord Woolman told McCutcheon: "On each occasion the victim was asleep and under the influence of alcohol."
The judge said his behaviour had caused "great distress and harm" and added: "There must be a clear message to deter you and others from such conduct."
Lord Woolman also ordered that McCutcheon be placed under supervision for a further two-year period after his release.
McCutcheon had denied assaulting the teenager on 8 December 2012 by going into the bed where she was sleeping at a house in Hamilton.
He also denied raping a woman at an address in the town more than two years later.
The court heard that father-of-one McCutcheon maintained that he was innocent of the crimes and claimed that the second woman had consented to intercourse.
He told the writer of a background report that he could not understand why two women should independently allege that he committed similar offences.
