It is the first fully funded state pension in East Africa.
Each pensioner will be entitled to 20,000 Tanzanian shillings ($9, £6) a month.
Campaigners have welcomed the move and say it will lead to a huge improvement, not just in the lives of the elderly - considered to be among the poorest in society - but for the rest of the country as well.
