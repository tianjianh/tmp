Plans for £300m critical care unit at Cwmbran resume

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mothballed plans to create Wales' first super-hospital for the critically ill have been put back on the agenda.

Development of a proposed £292m specialist hospital in Cwmbran was put on hold in January last year.
Health Minister Edwina Hart ordered more research to be done to ensure the plans were "robust".
Now the critical care unit has been included in the five-year plan of Aneurin Bevan Health Board, which runs NHS services in the former Gwent area.
The plan states that the Specialist and Critical Care Centre on the Llanfrechfa Grange site is the "way forward" for the community served by the health board.
But it acknowledges it may take five to 10 years for the centre to come to fruition.
The new hospital services vision would mean a network of six local hospitals, including the Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in Caerphilly and Ysbyty Aneurin Bevan in Ebbw Vale, Blaenau Gwent.
A smaller general hospital would still be based in Newport.
