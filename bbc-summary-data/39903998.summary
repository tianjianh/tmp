Shola Ameobi, Richard Duffy, Elliott Hewitt, Mike Edwards, Haydn Hollis, Rob Milsom, Jon Stead, Curtis Thompson and Alan Smith received contract offers.
Thierry Audel, Adam Campbell, Scott Loach and Mark Yeates have been released by manager Kevin Nolan.
"This is the toughest time of the season for a manager," said Nolan.
"I haven't enjoyed it one bit. I am, however, confident we have made the right decisions and put fair offers on the table."
