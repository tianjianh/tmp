The 35-year-old former US Open champion struggled with the problem at the recent Players Championship at Sawgrass, where he finished tied 19th.
"I am sad to have to miss what I regard as my home event," said the Englishman.
His withdrawal follows Rory McIlroy's decision to opt out of the tournament earlier this month.
The Northern Irish world number three did not want to play four weeks in a row.
