Aberdeen councillors back business rates relief plan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen councillors have voted to provide Â£3m of relief to firms hit by business rate rises if the Scottish government matches the pledge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has been urged to hold talks with leaders of the political groups at the authority.
The Scottish government recently announced a 12.5% cap on rises for those in the hospitality sector in the north east, and office premises in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.
Businesses have expressed concern.
The Scottish government recently highlighted its relief package and said it was up to local authorities to address local issues.
Why are business rates causing concern?
Business rates - what do they pay?
Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire councillors agreed a new council business rates relief scheme aimed at supporting about 1,200 businesses.
Rateable values are changing for the first time since 2010 after a national revaluation by The Scottish Assessors' Association.
Businesses in the north east have complained that they are being hit particularly hard because the valuations predated the slump in the price of oil which has had an impact on the local economy.
