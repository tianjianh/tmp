The Briton, 27, teamed up with visually impaired skier Gallagher to win gold at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi.
However, she suffered severe concussion in a training accident in Austria and has now decided to take a break.
"Charlotte will be very hard to replace," said GB performance director Duncan Freshwater.
Evans, who intends to focus her time on coaching youngsters, added: "It has been an amazing experience and one that I will always treasure."
She was forced to miss this year's Para-alpine World Championships in Canada as result of her injury, sustained when she and Gallagher collided.
Gallagher said it had been a "weighty decision" for Evans to step back but added that she intended to carry on competing.
