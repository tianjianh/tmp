John Clark is protesting against the alleged mistreatment of a 90-year-old woman at Rambla Nursing Home in Scarborough.
He claims there has been a "persistent failure" on the part of the relevant authorities to protect the woman.
The BBC approached Rambla Nursing Home but was told there was nobody available for comment.

Mr Clark began his protest on the steps of County Hall in Northallerton on Monday.
He said: "The reason I'm here is that you have somebody in a care home that's not getting enough food and not getting enough liquid, not through choice but because that is what she is being given."
He alleges the mistreatment was first highlighted in November 2013, but the woman was still not getting appropriate care.
North Yorkshire Police said it had carried out a "thorough investigation" into the allegations in December 2015 but there was no finding of wrongdoing.
A file was submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service but they decided not to prosecute.
Mr Clark said despite the decision he would continue his protest "till it's sorted".
The Care Quality Commission said it was looking into the claims and was in contact with the woman's family.
A recent inspection of the home rated it as "requiring improvement" and said "people's nutrition and hydration needs were met".
Richard Webb, corporate director for health and adult services at North Yorkshire County Council, said: "[Mr Clark] feels very strongly about this issue as do we all.
"We've been working with him for a number of weeks and I will personally be chairing a series of meetings on Thursday to try and find a way forward."
