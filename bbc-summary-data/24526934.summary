[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann have been searching several sites in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz.

Officers have used dogs to search the sites and "ground penetrating radar" to look for disturbed earth.
The searches follow a request from the Metropolitan Police, who launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July.
Madeleine, of Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment on 3 May 2007.
See the details below to find out about what happened that day and for the location of the latest police searches.
15:30-17:30 Charity men seen
20:30 McCanns go for dinner
21:05 McCanns check on children
21:15 Jane Tanner sees man and child
22:00 Irish family sees man and child
22:00 McCanns raise alarm
Scotland Yard says detectives are looking into possible links to burglaries and bogus charity collections in the area at the time. They have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify.
There were four separate sightings of charity collectors on the afternoon of 3 May in Praia da Luz. One man approached a property on Rua do Ramalhete, near the Ocean Club, at about 16:00. Another collector called at another apartment on 25 or 26 April.
Police say there was also a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar.
The McCanns were on holiday with a group of friends who met for dinner each evening at a Tapas bar on the Ocean Club complex where they were staying.
On the day Madeleine went missing, Mr and Mrs McCann left their apartment at 20:30 and headed to the restaurant. Throughout the evening, adults from the group would leave at regular intervals to check on their children. A member of the group - Matthew Oldfield - left at 21:00, shortly followed by Gerry McCann.
Mr McCann left the retaurant to check on his children at about 21:05. When he reached the apartment, he noticed the bedroom door was open wider than it had been left. On his return to the restaurant, he stopped to chat to a guest.
Matthew Oldfield also checked on the McCanns' apartment at about 21:30. Hearing no noise from the children's bedroom, he assumed all was well and left without seeing Madeleine.
Having left the table to check on her own children, another member of the group, Jane Tanner, saw a man carrying a child close to the McCanns' apartment. This sighting, which had previously been the focus of the investigation, has now been discounted by police. Detectives said the man was almost certainly an innocent British holiday-maker collecting his two-year-old daughter from a nearby creche.
An Irish family returning from a night out saw a man carrying a blonde-haired child, aged about three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas. He was walking down a street towards the beach at about 22:00. The beach is a few minutes' walk from the McCanns' apartment.
Two of the witnesses have helped produce an e-fit of the man they saw. They described him as white, aged in his 30s, of medium build and medium height, with short brown hair.
After friend Matthew Oldfield had checked on the McCanns' children half an hour previously, Kate McCann returned to the apartment at 22:00. It was then that she noticed the children's bedroom window was open, the shutter raised and Madeleine gone.
The first search area was cordoned off by police at the beginning of June, but nothing of interest was found. It is situated south-west of the Ocean Club complex, where the McCann family were staying in 2007. The scrubland, about the size of three football pitches, is surrounded by flats and villas and overlooks the sea.
The second area is on the other side of the Praia da Luz, close to the main road leading out of town. A third location was also investigated across the road from the second search area.
On 11 June, police said their searches had not yielded any results.
