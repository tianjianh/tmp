Andrew Strauss has apologised after he made an offensive remark about Kevin Pietersen during a live broadcast.

The former England captain was commentating for Sky Sports on the MCC v Rest of the World match at Lord's when he made the remark to Nick Knight.
Sky were on a break but viewers of Fox Sports in Australia, who take Sky's commentary, heard the exchange.
He referred to Pietersen in very derogatory terms
"I apologise unreservedly, particularly to Kevin Pietersen. I am mortified and profusely sorry," Strauss said.
In an earlier statement, Sky apologised for the "language used" by Strauss.
BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Murphy said: "We understand he thought he was off air but the comments were broadcast in Australia. Apparently during an advert break, Strauss was talking to Nick Knight, his co-commentator, and he referred to Pietersen in very derogatory terms."
Strauss, 37, was captain of England when Pietersen was dropped for sending derogatory text messages about his team-mates - and Strauss in particular - to members of the South Africa team in 2012.
Strauss retired shortly after that controversy and Pietersen was eventually brought back into the fold.
However, Pietersen's return was short-lived and in February was informed he was no longer part of the national team's plans.
