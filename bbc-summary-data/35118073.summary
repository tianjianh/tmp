Two defendants charged in the Fifa corruption scandal have pleaded not guilty to new charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) President Jose Maria Marin and US businessman Aaron Davidson entered the pleas at a court in New York.
The pair are accused of wire fraud conspiracy and other charges.
They were among 14 people named in a US indictment earlier this year accusing football officials of accepting bribes for lucrative marketing rights.
In December, 16 more officials were charged in a new indictment, including Mr Marin's successor as head of the CBF, Marco Polo Del Nero.
He appeared before Brazilian senators on Wednesday, denying charges of corruption and money laundering and saying he had been "unjustly accused".
Top Brazilian football stars including Pele and Zico have called for his resignation.
A former footballer, Mr Marin led the Brazilian confederation for three years until April 2015.
In a further development, lawyers for suspended Fifa Vice-President Michel Platini said he would boycott an ethics committee hearing into corruption allegations on Friday.
Mr Platini still hopes to replace Sepp Blatter as Fifa president, who is also banned and faces an ethics committee hearing. Both deny wrongdoing.
