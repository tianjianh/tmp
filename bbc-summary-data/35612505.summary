[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jermaine Lee, 32, of Gorse Road, Croydon, will serve a minimum of 18 years in prison for killing Woking man Khalilur Rahman, 44.
Mr Rahman's body was found at the Woking Hotel in Surrey, on 26 August 2015, Guildford Crown Court heard.
Lisa Warner, 35, of no fixed address, admits assisting an offender and will be sentenced on 7 July.
Officers were called to the Woking hotel on the morning of Wednesday, 26 August 2015 after staff discovered a body in one of the rooms.
Mr Rahman had suffered 15 blows to his face, body and arms before dying as a result of a head injury, a post-mortem examination found.
Lee's "unprovoked attack" on Mr Rahman involved punching him a number of times before striking him with a piece of wood, after a brief verbal altercation in the hotel room, Surrey Police said.
Lee admitted manslaughter at the beginning of the trial but denied murder.
Det Sup Karen Mizzi said: "This was a tragic incident where a man has lost his life.
"He died as a result of a viciously brutal and sustained assault by Jermaine Lee and the sentence given demonstrates the severity and impact of this horrendous crime."
Surrey Police said Mr Rahman's family had shown "tremendous dignity" and hoped the outcome would help them feel justice has been done.
Mr Rahman's family said: "Khalilur was caring, kind, loving and full of life but ultimately a dedicated family man, husband and father-of-two. His wife and boys were his life.
"His murder has left the family devastated, a void that will never be filled."
