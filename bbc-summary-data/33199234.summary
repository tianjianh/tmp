A multi-million pound investment is being made to modernise the Tyne and Wear Metro over the next year.

The owner, Nexus, is spending £40m on train refurbishment and track replacement as part of a £389m Government-funded plan.
A new traffic management system will be the largest investment in new technology for the control room since the Metro opened 30 years ago.
Central Station and three Gateshead stations will be refurbished.
This will include improved seating, lighting and accessibility.
Nexus said there would be weekend closures over the summer, but it was not expected that the traffic management installation would cause any disruption.
