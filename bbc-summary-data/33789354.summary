Kent Police are set to prioritise fresh produce hit by problems in Calais, following weeks of disruption by migrant activity and French strikes.
Scottish ministers said it would help protect Scotland's seafood exporters.
They have been looking at ways to help Scottish firms hit by the ongoing migrant crisis in France.
Earlier this week, it said the seafood industry was in need of urgent help, following talks with Scottish exporters.
The Scottish government said the move by Kent Police followed representations by ministers.
Scottish Food Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "The Scottish government has repeatedly called for action from the outset of this disruption, and so I welcome this move to prioritise key consignments - including fresh produce - through the Channel Tunnel and Port of Dover.
"At last we are seeing common sense prevail and a recognition of the impact on food exporters.
"Agreement of this protocol to prioritise a quick-to-market route is real progress and we will, of course, monitor its introduction and effectiveness."
He added: "While it is by no means a solution to the wider and on-going complex situation in Calais, it will be welcomed by Scottish seafood exporters who have seen orders plummet by up to 80% in some categories in recent weeks."
"With seafood exports worth five times as much in Scotland as the UK as a whole, we have been determined to find a way forward.
"With no end in sight to the situation at Calais, we will continue to look at options around alternative routes which could be used by hauliers."
