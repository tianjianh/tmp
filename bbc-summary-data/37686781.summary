[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 0-2 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dover's Ricky Miller continued his assault on the scoring charts with another goal in his side's 2-0 win at Bromley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Lafayette fed the Whites' front man for his 15th of the season on 25 minutes.
Almost immediately, Rob Swaine made a hash of an attempted clearance in his own area and Lafayette netted from a tight angle to make it 2-0.
The Ravens were relieved in the second half to see Miller substituted after two missed chances, but it was perhaps a sign that Chris Kinnear's men had sewn up the game.
Bromley's miserable night was completed when Dan Johnson was shown his marching orders for picking up a second yellow card.
