[SN]TITLE[SN]
Real Madrid 3-0 Alaves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid are two points clear at the top of La Liga with 10 games remaining after overcoming Alaves to record a fourth straight league win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karim Benzema put Zinedine Zidane's side on course for victory after meeting Dani Carvajal's fine cut-back.
Deyverson and Edgar wasted chances to equalise for Alaves before two goals in three minutes sealed the points.
Isco made it 2-0 before Nacho headed home after Gareth Bale's free-kick had rebounded off the bar into his path.
Later on Sunday, nearest challengers Barcelona won 4-1 at 10-man Granada to keep the gap at two points.
Relive the action from the Bernabeu
Despite a victory which nudged Real closer to their first league title since 2012, this was a far from vintage display by the European champions.
For long periods their players looked jaded after long trips during the international break.
Mid-table Alaves, promoted as champions of Spain's second-tier at the end of last season, beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Nou Camp last September and the Basque club will be frustrated they did not pick up at least a point at the Bernabeu.
With Real leading 1-0, Brazilian forward Deyverson headed wide in front of a gaping net while Edgar stabbed a first-time shot wide from close blank range.
It was only in the closing stages that Real put the game out of sight.
Cristiano Ronaldo slipped a delicious pass into the path of Isco to make it 2-0 before Nacho's header left Alaves to reflect on a harsh scoreline.
Earlier, Sevilla slipped out of the top three after being held to a goalless draw at home to struggling Sporting Gijon.
