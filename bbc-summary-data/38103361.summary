The tennis coach said the award came at the end of an "incredibly stressful, but ultimately very exciting week."
Her sons Andy and Jamie will finish 2016 as world number one tennis players.
Murray was one of three honorary graduates at the graduation ceremony in the Caird Hall.
It is her fifth honorary degree from a Scottish university and the second she has received this week, following an award from Aberdeen University on Thursday.
Murray, who received an Honorary Doctorate of Education, told BBC Scotland: "When I was at school I always thought I'd be a PE teacher and then my form teacher advised me away from that and said there were no jobs in teaching at that time.
"Ultimately, I ended up being what I always thought I would be, which was a sports teacher.
"So it means a lot to me that they have recognised what's been achieved in Scotland."
Author and journalist Matthew Syed, and video games composer and musician Rob Hubbard also received honorary degrees at the ceremony.
Abertay University principal, Professor Nigel Seaton, said: "We are proud to award honorary degrees to Judy Murray, Matthew Syed and Rob Hubbard today.
"Their outstanding achievements are the result of hard work, determination and perseverance and at Abertay University we are proud to hold them as exemplary and inspiring leaders."
