Eileen Blane was thrown to the floor and punched in the attack at her home in Stretford, Greater Manchester, on Friday afternoon, police said.
While the attacker searched upstairs, Mrs Blane escaped and alerted her neighbours.
Granddaughter Amy Blane has shared pictures of her "brave Nana" on social media in a bid to find the attacker.
The post has been shared more than 12,000 times.
Ms Blane said the man forced his way through a side door at the house after her grandmother opened the door to him and demanded cash and jewellery.
She said: "After dragging her through the house, throwing her into the lounge and kicking her dog into the wall, he then threatened her life by saying 'you will not get out of this house alive'."
"Despite losing so much, my Nana is heart broken as her late husband died 13 years ago and her precious wedding ring was stolen."
Ms Blane said her grandmother has been left "very shaken" after her ordeal and is "especially upset about her wedding ring".
"Tell your Nanas to keep safe and check in on them as often as possible because, at times like this, you really do realise how important Nanas are."
A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said Mrs Blane "suffered bruises over her face and head" in the assault and asked anyone with any information to contact them.
