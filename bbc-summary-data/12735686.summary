The Duke of Normandy will have a 50ft screen showing the silent movie classic, Around Cape Horn.
The film will be shown on Saturday 30 April with music by solo cellist Gerard Le Feuvre.
The tug is more commonly seen supporting large craft into the marina and carrying out maintenance work around the island.
The Duke of Normandy tug was first used in 2010 to show the final film of the Branchage Jersey International Film Festival.
Then, Russian propaganda film, Battleship Potemkin, was screened with music by French free form electro-jazz duo Zombie Zombie.
Around Cape Horn features footage shot by the late Captain Irving Johnson during his 1929 rounding of Cape Horn aboard a square rigger vessel.
The event is free and can be viewed from Albert Pier.
The film will be shown on Saturday 30 April from 2030 GMT.
