A specialist firm was brought in to help move the lorry, which was left leaning at an angle against the house.
The house is damaged but inspections are still going on to see how bad the situation is, Martin Lown from Hereford & Worcester Fire and Rescue Service said.
"We've got a structural engineer on site and as the recovery continues we will monitor the situation," he said.
Replacement buses are running between Shrewsbury and Hereford.
