A briefcase containing the jewellery was stolen on Tuesday while the star was performing in Phoenix, Arizona.
The bus had been used by the rapper and his official DJ, Future the Prince, on their Summer Sixteen tour.
The jewellery did not belong to Drake, but police did not confirm who owns it. Travion King, 21, was arrested on a burglary charge on Wednesday.
Mr King has worked as a stagehand at local entertainment venues in the past, but was not known to have been working at that particular show, police spokesman Vince Lewis said.
Mr King was initially arrested on a separate trespassing charge by campus police at Arizona State University in the early hours of Wednesday.
Police investigating the jewellery theft studied surveillance footage and then discovered their suspect was already in custody.
Drake is one of hip-hop's biggest stars, known for hits including Hotline Bling and One Dance.
