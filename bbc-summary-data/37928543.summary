A retired Dundee civil servant and former radio presenter is the new voice of the BT speaking clock.

Alan Steadman, 69, is the first Scottish voice - and the first non-English voice - chosen for the role.
He was announced on BBC's The One Show as the winner of a competition marking the clock's 80th anniversary.
Mr Steadman, who presented a weekly local radio jazz programme for 33 years until January, said recording for the clock was an "interesting experience."
He said: "I found that your eyes begin to blur a bit because of all the numbers that you're reading, but I think it went okay."
Mr Steadman entered the competition "at the eleventh hour" after a friend encouraged him to apply.
The other finalists were Crea Barton, a 20-year-old student from Bangor in County Down, and Verity Giles, a 37-year-old business manager from Bridgend.
Mr Steadman is only the fifth person to give the time "at the third stroke" when people dial 123.
David Hay, head of BT Heritage and a member of the judging panel, said: "Competition was tough.
"It was so difficult to choose the winner from our finalists because any one of them would be a great new voice for the speaking clock.
"But Alan stood out and I think we've found a fantastic new voice."
Sara Mendes da Costa had been the voice of the speaking clock since winning the last competition in 2007.
About 12 million calls a year are still made to the speaking clock, which was launched on 24 July, 1936.
BT donated 10p to the BBC's Children in Need 2016 from each call from the start of the competition in August until the result was announced.
