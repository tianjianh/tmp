The 28-year-old has most recently been playing at the Rio 2016 Olympics, helping Argentina to a sixth-placed finish in the rugby sevens.
He was also capped by the Argentina XV side once in 2008.
"He was part of an impressive squad at the Olympics. He has the fitness levels to go straight into the Premiership," said director of rugby Jim Mallinder.
"He's a powerful and elusive runner with a good set of handling skills as well as strong defence, and we're looking forward to seeing what he can do here at Franklin's Gardens."
