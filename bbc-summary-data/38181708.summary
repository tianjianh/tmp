Firefighters were called to the scene in George Street, Bathgate, at about 20:00 on Thursday after several calls reporting that a building was well alight.
They rescued a baby girl, three women and two men from flats above the shop in the town.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said there were no reports of injuries.
Eleven firefighters and a senior officer dealt with the blaze which was under control by about 23:20.
Insp Drew Elliot, of Police Scotland, said: "Our inquiries are at an early stage, however we are treating this fire as suspicious.
"As such we are investigating all lines of inquiry and I urge anyone who saw or heard any suspicious activity in the area to contact police immediately.
"Fortunately no one was injured in this incident, however a significant amount of damage was caused and parts of the building are currently uninhabitable.
"We will continue to work closely with our colleagues at the fire service as part of a joint investigation into the cause of the fire."
