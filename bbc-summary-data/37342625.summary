A footballer who smashed a bottle over a man's head in a nightclub has been released from prison on appeal, days after he missed his club debut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ryan Inniss, 21, who is on a season-long loan at Southend United from Crystal Palace, was jailed for 14 weeks after he admitted assault.
It meant he was in HMP Belmarsh when his League One club faced Scunthorpe away on Saturday.
A judge has now suspended the sentence for 18 months.
Inniss, of Albemarle Road, Beckenham, south-east London, was jailed at Bexley Magistrates' Court on Wednesday following the assault at Time nightclub in Beckenham on 1 May.
Judge Adam Hiddleston, who heard the appeal at Croydon Crown Court, ordered Inniss complete 240 hours community service and banned him from entering licensed premises - except for work or buying food - for a year.
He must also complete an alcohol treatment requirement and comply with the magistrates' order to pay ??300 to his victim.
Defender Inniss has never made a first-team appearance for Crystal Palace and has had loan spells at Cheltenham Town, Luton Town, Gillingham, Yeovil Town and Port Vale.
He signed with Southend United last month.
