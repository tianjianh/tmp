The 26-year-old Belarusian said she planned to return to "the very top" of the sport after giving birth at the end of the year.
Azarenka and her boyfriend learned she was pregnant while she was recovering from a knee injury.
"We couldn't be happier and feel very blessed to begin this exciting journey," said the world number six.
"I have been truly inspired by so many strong female athletes who return to the very top of their sport after having children, and I plan to do exactly that."
Azarenka was Australian Open champion in 2012 and 2013 and a beaten US Open finalist in the same years.
She has not played since retiring from a first-round match against Italian Karin Knapp at the French Open in May.
