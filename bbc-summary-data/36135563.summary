County Championship: Bears opener Varun Chopra hits century to thwart Yorkshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ex-Warwickshire skipper Varun Chopra made his first century since giving up the captaincy to all but ensure the rain-hit County Championship meeting with Yorkshire will end as a draw.

The Bears have lost three straight home Championship games to the Tykes by an innings but the champions could make no impact on a weather-affected day three.
Yorkshire added just 11 runs to their overnight score to total 379 all out.
The Bears reached 205-2, Ian Bell's 59 being followed by Chopra's 101 not out.
Bell's predecessor as Warwickshire captain was still there with Jonathan Trott for company on 38 when, on a decidedly fresh day in the second city, rain ended play for the day at tea.
Having lost 88 overs to the weather on the first two days, they had to break early for lunch after a late-morning sleet shower before the loss of the whole evening session.
The match appears destined to finish as a draw, with the Bears 174 runs behind and only one day left.
Earlier, Bell put on 132 with Chopra for the second wicket before edging to slip, following the early loss of the Bears' other former skipper Ian Westwood, who was bowled by Jack Brooks.
That was after Steven Patterson had added just one run to his overnight score to finish unbeaten on a new career-best 63.
Ryan Sidebottom was the last Yorkshireman to fall, edging to second slip to give England's Chris Woakes a fourth wicket.
But the 38-year-old former England left-armer then limped off the field with a sore ankle after bowling the third ball of his sixth over - and did not return.
Warwickshire batsman Varun Chopra told BBC WM:
"I felt pretty good at Lord's last week. It was a shame I couldn't kick on there but it was nice to get runs against a good bowling attack and put us in a pretty good position.
"I have not had the best record against Yorkshire in the past so I was determined to put that right. It is a pretty good batting wicket and I made the most of it.
"It was nice to get runs against the champions. It's my first ton against Yorkshire.
"It's probably the coldest day I have ever batted in. I have never come off the field for snow in my life. That was definitely a first."
Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie:
"Ryan Sidebottom's injury is being assessed. He has had some discomfort in his ankle so we are just awaiting the information from our medical staff.
"It's been very frustrating for both sides. You can't control the weather but snow is certainly a new one for me. I've never seen a game of cricket snowed off before.
"It's been a tough game to get going in. We lost a lot of overs in the first two days and then again today so the game hasn't really got underway. It's been difficult for both sides to sink their teeth in.
"Steve Patterson batted really well. He hasn't shut up about it, but good luck to him. He assessed the situation and saw that Warwickshire were looking to bowl short at him so he thought he'd take it on and he did really well."
