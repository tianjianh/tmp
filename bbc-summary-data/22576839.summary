[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The extradition of one of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been delayed by an investigation into separate charges by Spanish police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Moran, 31, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was arrested at a luxury villa in Alicante last week.
He was convicted of armed robbery in his absence after fleeing a Burnley court in 2009.
He faces investigation over drugs and weapons found at his house, Spanish police said.
He could also face charges of escaping from police who tracked him down in Murcia in November by ramming two police vehicles and driving the wrong way down a motorway.
Moran was placed on the most wanted list after leaping from the dock and assaulting four security guards during his trial at Burnley Crown Court in February 2009.
He was found guilty, alongside Stephen Devalda, of taking part in an armed robbery in which Royal Mail guards were threatened with a gun, machete and baseball bat in Colne, Lancashire, in May 2005.
One of the guards was assaulted before the offenders escaped with Â£25,000.
Devalda, 29, also from Salford, had also been on the run but was captured in Spain in March 2011.
He was later jailed by a judge at Preston Crown Court, for nine years and eight months.
