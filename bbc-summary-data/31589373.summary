The 48-year-old is currently in charge of the Sevens squad and will now also lead the XVs in a new role which combines both duties.
Middleton will start in May after the Sevens World Series.
"I am coming into this role when women's rugby is in a great place. It is a really exciting time to be involved," said Middleton.
"For me personally, this is a fantastic opportunity and a challenge I am really looking forward to."
His new contract runs until 2017.
England won the World Cup by defeating Canada last August but several of the players in that squad have since retired from international rugby.
The Rugby Football Union parted company with Gary Street, who led the team to the World Cup, just before the start of the Six Nations.
Nicky Ponsford, head of women's performance, took over, along with Street's assistant coach Graham Smith.
England lost to Wales but beat Italy in their two Six Nations games so far.
They travel to Ireland for their next fixture on Friday (19:30 GMT).
