[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jeremy Corbyn and the issue of loyalty

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Where are the new shadow ministers swearing loyalty for ever more? Where are the full-throated cries of support from the whole team for the leader?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nowhere, because Jeremy Corbyn will never be able to persuade the members of all of his team to support all of his positions publicly, let alone in twenty four hours. But also, because he says he wants full and frank discussions about what to do.
So by accident or design, or probably both, today new shadow ministers have been free to pick and choose which bits of Project Corbyn they like -  even turning down one job in favour of another because of their beliefs.
For the world in Westminster, where the wheels are greased with loyalty, discipline and ambition, this is a departure.
For the new leader's thousands of backers and maybe millions of voters, giving politicians permission to say what they actually think might be welcome, even noble and pure - the first real sign of his new politics?
Mr Corbyn's achievement was to build a power base in town halls around the country. But it is in Westminster where he must now operate to have any hope of commanding. The existing systems are not perfect but based on getting things done. Many voters might warm to Mr Corbyn's approach - but in the end, the electorate rarely tolerates parties who can't decide.
