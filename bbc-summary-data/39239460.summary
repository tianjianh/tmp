[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-0 Coventry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MK Dons ended a four-game winless run by beating Coventry to open up a six-point gap over the League One relegation places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart O'Keefe's second goal of the season six minutes after the break was all that MK needed to secure only their second win in nine games, while Mark Robins' Coventry are now 17 points adrift of safety.
After an even opening 20 minutes, it was the hosts who were first to record a shot on goal as centre-back George Williams burst forward from the halfway line before firing a low fizzing effort from 25 yards into the safe hands of Lee Burge in the Sky Blues goal.
The Dons made their slender superiority pay early in the second half as Cardiff loanee O'Keefe opened the scoring with a superb half-volley from the edge of the penalty area which sailed past Burge and into the top-left corner.
Coventry threatened towards the end of the second half as Ruben Lameiras forced Dons keeper David Martin into a smart save, but Robins' men could not prevent a fourth defeat in six.
