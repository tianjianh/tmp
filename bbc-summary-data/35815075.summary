[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new engineering and digital technology park for the University of Chichester have been submitted to the local council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Arun District Council said the plans for Bognor Regis also included student accommodation, car parking and an access road from Felpham Way.
The university's digital technology and engineering department will move to the site if permission is granted.
It was awarded Â£8m funding from the government last year.
The technology park will have places for 500 undergraduate and postgraduate students per year.
The council said the six-storey student accommodation building, to the north of the proposed five-storey teaching block, will provide 171 bedrooms.
The site, next to the Upper Bognor Conservation Area, has been classified in the Arun Local Plan since 2003 as an area of expansion for the university.
The public has until 7 April to comment on the plans, which will then be considered by councillors.
