Bogus doctor: Conrad de Souza admits lying to get more NHS jobs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who spent a decade pretending to be a doctor has again admitted trying to lie his way into NHS jobs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Conrad de Souza, 57, of Fulham, West London, lied to NHS services about his qualifications, employment and previous convictions while try to get top jobs.
At Croydon Crown Court, he admitted six counts of fraud by false representations.
In 2011, he was convicted for pretending to be a GP to gain a senior managerial role.
The Tasmanian-born British citizen had enrolled at the University of London medical school in 1980 but never graduated.
NHS Protect, which took De Souza to court, said the fake doctor tried to become head of service at a care commissioning group and interim director of development commissioning at a clinical commissioning group.
He also lied about his employment and qualifications in a bid to get work at the Office for Public Management and admitted dishonestly making eight representations to a recruitment agency.
De Souza pleaded not guilty to three further charges of fraud, which were laid on file.
De Souza was previously jailed for two years and three months for falsifying a parental test to avoid paying child maintenance, and for dishonestly purporting to be a doctor.
His deception to the health service led to him working in several clinical strategy roles for Lewisham Primary Care Trust - earning Â£329,000 between 2001 and 2010.
After his conviction, he was ordered to repay Â£270,000 to the NHS.
Richard Rippin, head of operations for NHS Protect, said: "What is obvious is that de Souza sees himself as suitable for top health jobs even if nobody else does.
"Had he succeeded in his latest, deceitful job hunt, de Souza would have regained considerable power, responsibility and financial reward - a frightening prospect."
He will be sentenced on 12 January 2017.
