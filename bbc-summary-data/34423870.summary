Film audience endure their own Groundhog Day

Cinema goers in south Wales attempted to break a "totally useless world record" as they watched the comedy classic Groundhog Day again and again.

The audience at Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, sat through five screenings of the 1993 Bill Murray film, starting on Friday evening.
They bought tickets for every showing - and sat through the same trailers and adverts.
The event at the town's The Market Hall was in aid of a children's hospice.
Organisers say it is no coincidence that the film tells the story of a TV reporter who becomes trapped in time.
He relives the same day over and over, while visiting the Pennsylvania town of Punxsutawney, in the United States, during its annual Groundhog Day celebrations.
Peter Watkins-Hughes, project manager at The Market Hall, said they wanted the audience to "try to live Groundhog Day".
"They've got to buy their tickets, take their seat, watch the film, come out and then buy another ticket, take their seats and then come out again," he said before the record attempt.
Between 22:00 BST on Friday and 08:00 on Saturday, the audience of up to 212 people endured the film being replayed five times.
Organisers said they had been in touch with officials at Guinness World Records, who told them they would hold the world record for the event - even if in Mr Watkins-Hughes own words, it is "bonkers".
