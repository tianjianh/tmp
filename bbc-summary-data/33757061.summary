[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plans submitted for new £13.5m Wrexham police station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new £13.5m police station could be built in north Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans for a 32-cell custody suite at Llay, Wrexham, have been submitted to Wrexham council.
The new station would be energy efficient with solar panels on the roof and energy-saving lighting.
North Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Winston Roddick said the town's current station was "no longer fit for purpose" and the new station would be "more economical".
