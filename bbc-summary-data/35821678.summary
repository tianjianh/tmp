A spokesperson for the commission said: "The IPCC is investigating two complaints relating to the same Lincolnshire Police dog.
"The IPCC received two complaint referrals from the force, one relating to the dog biting a member of the public in the Moulton Marsh area on 27 February, and another incident where it is alleged to have bitten another dog near Fishtoft on 29 February."
Lincolnshire Police said Falco's operational licence had been suspended pending the outcome of any investigation.
The force said this was normal practice and "not a pre-judgement of the circumstances".
The incident involving Barbie happened on a private lane while Falco was with handler Mick Judge. The three-year-old terrier had to put down because of the extent of her injuries.
Police are yet to comment on the circumstances of the incident involving the member of the public.
Barbie's owner Charles Giermak said the attack on his dog could have been avoided if Falco had been muzzled.
