Consultant paramedic Mike Jackson, who was first on the scene, said in addition to the two "critical" injuries, a further three of the girls were likely to have fractured limbs or head injuries.
He described the remaining three victims as "walking wounded".
Belvedere Academy, a nearby girls school, posted a statement on its website which said: "Unfortunately there has been a road traffic accident outside the academy.
"School bus service will be significantly delayed. Please make arrangements to collect your daughter as soon as possible."
Several roads in the area have been closed, including Belvidere Road, the junction at Devonshire Road and Admiral Street and the junction between Princess Gate and South Street.
