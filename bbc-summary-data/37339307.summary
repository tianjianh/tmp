After finishing sixth in the final of the T37 100m, the 22-year-old, who has cerebral palsy, took to social media to thank his fans and express his pride.
Jones' tweet seems to have struck a chord with the public and so far has nearly 400 'favourites' and has been re-tweeted more than 100 times.
It read: "Thank you everyone! I'm 6th in the world! From the Rhondda and I'm sixth in the whole wide world."
On the way to the final in Rio on Sunday, the 22-year-old, who went to school in Aberdare, ran a new personal best of 11.77 seconds and took part in a heat which saw a new world record set.
Jones added to his original tweet to thank all those who had supported him and helped him makes his Paralympic dream come true.
"What can I say?" Jones wrote.
"Firstly I'd like to say thank you to everyone for the tremendous support. I'm absolutely overwhelmed. It was completely amazing.
"A few months ago I never envisaged that I'd be going to my second Paralympic Games let alone make the final.
"Thank you to everyone who's been part of my team this year, there's too many to name, but you know who you are.
"I'm now looking forward to kicking back and enjoying watching my friends compete."

The T37 100m is for runners with coordination impairments in one half of their body and Jones, from Clydach Vale, has tasted success in athletics after switching from pan-disability football.
He took part in the 100m and 200m at the Paralympics in London four years ago and since then has won a bronze medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2014 and is also a European bronze medallist.
