Bayern Munich assistant manager Paul Clement has confirmed he turned down a coaching role with England under new boss Sam Allardyce.

The 44-year-old is working alongside Carlo Ancelotti at the Bundesliga champions, after being sacked as Derby County boss earlier this year.
Reports suggest Clement had been earmarked for a role in Allardyce's new backroom team on a job-share basis.
But on Twitter he said he intended to "concentrate solely" on Bayern.
"Following recent media reports I would like to clarify the situation with regards to a possible role with the England national team," he said on Tuesday.
"After consultation between FC Bayern, the [English] Football Association and myself, it was decided that it is in the best interests of everyone involved for me to concentrate solely on the job I have in Munich.
"I would like to wish success to Sam, the FA and the England team."
Clement linked up again with Ancelotti in June, having previously worked with him at Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris St-Germain.
