He spoke of his opposition to nuclear weapons and the need to retrain workers based at Faslane submarine base.
The left-wing MP, whom pollsters have put as the frontrunner, is holding rallies in Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.
Mr Corbyn's opponents include fellow MPs Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall.
The outcome of the contest will be made public at a special conference on 12 September.
The Scottish Labour Party is also in the process of choosing a new leader with MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh fighting for votes north of the border.
Mr Corbyn was in Aberdeen on Thursday afternoon and later visited Dundee.
A Labour analysis estimates 19,000 Scottish jobs are dependant on the Faslane submarine base.
Mr Corbyn opposes the renewal of Trident and believes the existing nuclear arms should be decommissioned.
Speaking to journalists in Aberdeen he said: "My life has been one of a moral opposition to nuclear weapons
"We've put forward serious proposals for a defence diversification agenda for the whole of the UK to ensure jobs are not lost, those skills are not lost, the engineering capability is not lost
"Instead, they're not making nuclear weapons, they're making something that is safer and more useful to the whole world."
Mr Corbyn rejected the SNPs aim of Scottish independence but said he was willing to work with the party to fight the Welfare Reform Bill.
He also said he did not support English laws for English issues, adding: "It's a UK Parliament and all members of the UK Parliament should be able to vote on all issues that are before the UK Parliament".
On Friday afternoon, he will be in Edinburgh before holding his fourth rally in Glasgow later that day.
In June, Mr Burnham and Ms Cooper were in Scotland to speak to supporters.
Mr Burnham said he was the only candidate who could unite the party in all nations and regions of Britain.
When she was in Edinburgh, Ms Cooper said she opposed the creation of a separate Scottish Labour party.
Ms Kendall agreed with that assessment saying a split between Scottish Labour and the UK party was not the answer to combating SNP support.
Labour in Scotland lost 40 of its 41 MPs at the May general election.
