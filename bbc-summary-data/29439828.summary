Dennis Kimetto received a hero's welcome on his return to Kenya, following his world record-breaking performance at the Berlin Marathon.

The former farmer became the first man to break the two hours three minutes mark for a marathon on Sunday.
He was given a red carpet reception on his return to Nairobi airport.
The 30-year-old, who only started professional running five years ago, said he "didn't expect to break the world record".
He shook off fellow Kenyan Emmanuel Mutai with just under three miles remaining to run 2:02:57.
Kimetto was adorned with flowers and garlands as he was taken on a victory tour of Kenya's capital.
He said: "I went to Berlin to just compete but I thank God that I have come back as a world record holder. It was a surprise."
The previous world record had been set on the same course 12 months ago by Kimetto's compatriot Wilson Kipsang, who ran 2:03:23.
