[SN]TITLE[SN]
Florent Cuvelier: Walsall midfielder out until April

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Walsall midfielder Florent Cuvelier will be out until April with a calf injury suffered in their 0-0 draw with Scunthorpe on 14 February.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cuvelier has made 20 appearances for the Saddlers this season, having signed for the League One club in June 2016.
The 24-year-old was forced to miss almost two months with an ankle problem earlier this season.
"It was one of those innocuous things and I don't think it could have been prevented," manager Jon Whitney said.
"What you do is you deal with it quickly, you get him strong and he'll come back even stronger."
