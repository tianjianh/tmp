Large fire at Wrotham industrial estate tackled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Homes near an industrial estate in Kent were evacuated after a large fire broke out at garages and workshops.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The occupants of six homes near the Tower Industrial Estate in Wrotham had to move out on Sunday evening.
The fire started at about 18:00 GMT with 10 fire appliances tackling the flames at its height.
Residents were advised to keep their windows and doors closed because some of the workshops were thought to have contained acetylene and asbestos.
Part of the A20 at Wrotham Heath had to be closed in both directions, as was the M20 eastbound slip road at junction two.
Firefighters were still at the scene on Monday morning, damping down hot spots.
