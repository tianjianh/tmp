An academy school in Bath will close at the end of the 2018 summer term, a council has announced.

The proposal to close Bath Community Academy (BCA) was made by the Cabot Learning Federation in July last year.
The school opened in 2012 but has had consistently low pupil numbers. It has capacity for 720 students but currently has only 241.
Bath and North East Somerset Council said it is aiming to ensure a "smooth transition" of pupils to other schools.
Councillor Michael Evans, cabinet member for children's services, said the authority will be "seeking to engage with all stakeholders and the community on the most appropriate future for the... site".
"The council has already made it clear that we would like for the site to continue to be used for educational purposes, as well as the continuation of the sport and leisure facilities on the site," he added.
The Cabot Learning Federation confirmed it will be making a contribution towards new school uniform costs for pupils affected by the closure.
A federation spokesman said they are "committed to ensuring high standards" for pupils remaining at the academy school over the coming months.
