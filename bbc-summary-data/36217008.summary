George Francis Kidson was found by police on 5 November, 2015 at his Sowerby home and died four days later.
Ryan Brady Campbell, 30, of Racecourse Mews, Thirsk, was jailed for 11-and-a-half years at Teesside Crown Court.
He had denied murder but was found guilty of manslaughter following a trial.
In a statement, Mr Kidson's family said: "We have prematurely lost a valuable member of our family in desperately distressing circumstances, that must have led to him experiencing considerable pain and fear.
"For these reasons we welcome the verdict and sentencing passed today.
"We would like to pass our thanks to the North Yorkshire Police for their continued support and the manner in which the investigation was conducted."
Det Sup Matt Walker said: "This was a difficult and tragic case for everyone concerned and the sentence given to Campbell reflects the gravity of the offence he committed."
He added: "I hope the sentence gives his family some sense of justice and closure to what has been a very difficult time for them."
