Police are continuing to search for 21-year-old Jed Allen who they want to question in connection with the deaths.
The bodies of Janet Jordon, 48, her six-year-old daughter Derrin and Philip Howard, 44, were found at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday.
CCTV footage of Mr Allen at Oxford railway station has also been released.
The footage shows him in WH Smith store on Saturday shortly before 18:00 BST.
He was wearing a red or maroon shirt, a dark jacket with a distinctive flash on the zip, a hooded top, blue jeans and dark shoes.
Det Supt Chris Ward, of Thames Valley Police, said: "If anybody knows where he is and is deliberately harbouring him, that is a very serious offence.
"If that is the case they need to contact us as soon as possible."
Mr Allen, who has a distinctive black spider tattoo on his left hand, is described as white, about 6ft (1.8m) tall and stocky.
Thames Valley Police confirmed he was known to the force and has warned the public not to approach him, although he is not considered dangerous to the wider community.
Mr Ward added: "We are conducting a number of searches to try and locate the suspect. These will continue today and extra officers and national resources have been deployed in order to assist us with that.
"We have recovered a weapon from within the crime scene but our search for the suspect continues today."
More than 100 officers - some of them armed - have been taking part in searches, which involved closing Oxford University Parks where Mr Allen used to work as a groundsman. The park has since reopened.
Police said the presence of armed police was "purely for the safety of the searching officers".
Didcot town councillor Margaret Davies described Mr Allen as calm and normal.
She said: "He's worked for a couple of years for Didcot Town Council and has been calm, has been working in the parks and has been fine. Studying at Abingdon and Witney College - a normal person."
John Myers, head teacher of All Saint's Primary School in Didcot, where Derrin was a pupil, described her as "a beautiful, happy, gentle, little girl, just a lovely, gentle, little soul... with lots of friends".
Ladygrove Community Centre, next door to the school, is opening its doors to allow staff, children and families to pay tribute to the little girl.
