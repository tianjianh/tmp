Four Polish lorry drivers who were arrested after 68 suspected illegal immigrants were found locked in their vehicles have been released on bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Passengers from Afghanistan, China, Vietnam and Russia were found inside the lorries at Harwich International Port in Essex on Thursday.
The men, who were arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration, have been bailed until 2 July.
Fifteen of those discovered hiding amid Polish washing machines were children.
Bernard Jenkin, MP for Harwich and North Essex said it was one of the "biggest single finds of clandestines coming into the UK".
Mr Jenkin told the BBC the migrants had clearly been in the trucks for a long time, and many had been dehydrated and very tired.
He said the individuals were questioned about whom they had paid, how much they had paid and where they had got on the lorries - but none spoke English making communication difficult.

Some of the most sick - including two pregnant women - had been treated at Colchester Hospital and since discharged, the Home Office said.
It is believed those not seeking asylum will be sent back to their home country.
