[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tracey Woodford, 47, was found three days after she was reported missing by her family.
She was seen leaving the Skinny Dog pub in the town on Tuesday with a 50-year-old man, understood to be Christopher May, who has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Her body was found by police in a flat in Pontypridd at 15:00 BST on Friday.
South Wales Police said the man and woman were seen together in the pub on Tuesday.
Speaking at a press conference on Saturday afternoon, Det Supt Paul Hurley said they left shortly after 23:00 - about ten hours after Ms Woodford was last seen by her family in Rhydyfelin.
He said: "The tragic events surrounding the death have had a profound effect on her family and the wider community, especially given the harrowing circumstances of her death."
Areas of the town were cordoned off on Friday evening following the discovery of the body, including near Pontypridd Rugby Club, where officers conducted a search.
The cordons remained in place on Saturday.
Police said they would like to hear from anybody who was in the Skinny Dog on Tuesday between 21:00 and 23:00 who might have seen or heard anything suspicious.
They also appealed for information from people living near Andrews Court, where Ms Woodford's body was found, or who were near the rugby ground on Sardis Road.
