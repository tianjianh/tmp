Reigan Knight and Liam Phillips, both 17, were killed when the Ford Escort they were passengers in crashed in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, as it was being followed by police on 27 December.
Reigan's family said he was an "amazing son who had so much potential".
"There is now a space in our family that can never be filled," Liam's family said.
On Friday, about 300 people attended a candlelit beach vigil for the two boys, with many launching sky lanterns in their memory.
Reigan's family said they could not "describe the agonising pain and heartbreak we are experiencing now".
"The thought of going through life without you is unbearable. You were such a kind, charming, loving, confident, handsome, well-mannered young man who was such a character," they added.
Liam's family said he would be "dearly missed by all that knew and loved him".
A 16-year-old from Great Wakering has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving and will next appear in court later this month.
A 17-year-old boy from Shoebury, who was arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs, has been released on bail.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has started an investigation into the crash.
