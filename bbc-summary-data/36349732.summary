Welsh swimmer Chloe Tutton's "meteoric rise" has been a boost for British swimming, says Sharron Davies.

Tutton won European bronze in the 100m breaststroke on 18 May after setting a national record for the 200m in April.
Davies, an Olympic silver medallist in 1980, says the 19-year-old "came out of nowhere" but does not expect her to win a medal at Rio 2016.
"We needed it because British women's breaststroke has not been amazing," said the 53-year-old Briton.
Tutton shaved three seconds off her personal best when she broke the British record in Glasgow - a performance that led to selection for the GB team going to this summer's Olympics in Brazil.

Her bronze medal-winning performance at the European Championships in London was followed by sixth place in the 200m final.
After that race Tutton vowed to improve before the Games, which start on 5 August.
"It's an amazing experience and I think I can learn a lot," she said.
"So that's what I'll do - I'll go away and I'll see what I can improve on and hopefully come back stronger."
Davies, runner-up in the 400m medley in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, added: "I don't think we're expecting Chloe to go there to win medals.
"She could probably make a final, which I think would be her target - certainly a semi final."
