Worcester Wolves might find it "difficult" to keep key forward Perris Blackwell at the club next season, says director of basketball Paul James.

Blackwell scored 590 points in 34 appearances in his rookie season in the British Basketball League last term.
The 6ft 9in Californian has been offered a new deal by Wolves but is yet to confirm whether he is going to sign.
"We're still talking and we're still very hopeful," James told BBC Hereford and Worcester.
Blackwell joined Wolves last summer after starting his professional basketball career in Chile and helped Worcester to a fourth-placed finish in the BBL in 2015-16, as well as a semi-final spot in the BBL Trophy.
"He did really well in what was effectively his rookie season," James said.
"We're desperate to get him back but it might be difficult to do that. There will certainly be other clubs from other leagues looking at him.
"We've got everything a player could want here in terms of facilities and our salaries probably match up with most teams in the league, so it would be hard to see a player leave here for another club in the BBL."
After seeing his side bow out of the Championship play-offs at the quarter-final stage for the second straight season after defeat by Glasgow Rocks, James is keen to make sure the club keeps improving.
"We've identified some new, quality players and hopefully if the players we want to come back do return, we'll be a tough team," James added.
"We've finished third and fourth in the last few years and now it's about trying to get above that.
"We're a top-four team now but we want to be winning things and challenging for the Championship."
