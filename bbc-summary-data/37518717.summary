Jones, of Colwyn Bay, Conwy, announced last month that he has a severe type of dementia.
Fellow Python star Michael Palin paid tribute to his "most wonderful friend" before presenting him with the award.
Jones told the crowd to "quieten down" before his son told the crowd it was a "great honour".
Accepting the accolade on his father's behalf, a tearful Bill Jones told the audience in Cardiff: "It's a great honour for dad. We're so proud of him... with the struggles we're having at the moment, it's been hard."
