After an opening draw against Australia and disappointing defeat to India, GB needed a victory to have any chance of reaching Friday's gold medal final.
Ashley Jackson opened the scoring, before David Condon (twice) and Alistair Brogdon struck to secure all three points.
"We wanted to come out and prove a point," Condon told BBC Sport.
"We were good against Australia but let ourselves down against India, so we really wanted to give the crowd something to shout about today."
The match also saw Henry Weir claim his 100th international cap from combined Great Britain and England games.
Weir said: "I'm obviously really happy to reach that landmark, but it was about getting the result today and I think we looked more like ourselves."
After scoring just once in their opening two fixtures GB signalled their intent to threaten as an attacking force early on against Korea.
They dominated the first half with goals from Jackson and then Condon in each of the opening two quarters, before Seungju You brought Korea back into contention before half-time.
The British men lost none of their focus in the final two quarters, though, scoring twice more to ensure the victory.
GB head coach Bobby Crutchley told BBC Sport: "It's really pleasing to score some good goals and create lots of chances.
"We need to keep building throughout the tournament, but we need to do enough early on to give us a chance of reaching that final.
"It'll be exactly the same [at Rio 2016], where we'll need to cope with the pressure and perform throughout," he added.
Britain will next face Olympic champions Germany on Tuesday, before rounding off the pool-stage against Belgium on Thursday.
The top two ranked teams will then face-off for gold on Friday, with third and fourth battling it out for bronze.
