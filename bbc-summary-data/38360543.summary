Huddersfield Town 2-1 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town will end 2016 in the Championship play-off places after coming back to beat 10-man Nottingham Forest for a fourth straight win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hildeberto Pereira chipped debutant goalkeeper Joel Coleman to put the visitors in front in the first half.
Kasey Palmer's header off the bar then hit goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic and crossed the line to equalise.
Michael Mancienne swung the game the Terriers' way when he turned into his own net, before being sent off late on.
The former Chelsea and Hamburg defender had already been booked when he let his frustration get to him by blocking the taking of a throw-in, prompting referee Chris Kavanagh to show a red card.
While Huddersfield were pressing their claims for promotion over the festive period, Forest arrived at the John Smith's Stadium looking for a lift after three defeats from four - and initially they got it.
Pereira's goal on 25 minutes was well-taken during a rare raid on goal and Forest were organised enough to limit the home side's chances in the first half.
However, Town's dominance of the ball was turned into goals after the break and it proved a comfortable final quarter for the home side.
Huddersfield are fourth in the Championship table, six points off second-placed Brighton.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
"We are still hungry and greedy.
"We still have space to improve both individually and as a group. We have been together for five months and we have another five months to go.
"I love Boxing Day, I have won both matches on Boxing Day since I have been here. The fans in England want football at Christmas and this is different to Germany but I like it.
"I think I will have to stay for a long time. But we still have to be focused and keep working hard."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"I was very disappointed with some of the decisions. It was a throw-in to us but there is a red card.
"I tell the players to be careful about their reaction. It was frustration. I am not satisfied with his reaction but I understand his reaction.
"It was very tough but we have to accept the result. After the two goals we conceded we defended very well as a unit.
"When Huddersfield were leading 2-1 it was easier for them being at home."
