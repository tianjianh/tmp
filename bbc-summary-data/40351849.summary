The animals were grazing near Kirkcudbright harbour in Dumfries and Galloway when they wandered onto the mud as temperatures soared.
Fire crews from Kirkcudbright, Castle Douglas and Gatehouse of Fleet and the local lifeboat raced to the rescue as the tide came in.
The calves were finally pulled free using two 45m hoses.
A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: "We got a report of the calves stuck in the mud and sent units to the scene at Kirkcudbright harbour.
"The lifeboat was also called out because of the threat of the incoming tide."
The spokesman added: "Fortunately the firefighters were able to pull the calves to safety and they were unhurt and returned to the farmer."
