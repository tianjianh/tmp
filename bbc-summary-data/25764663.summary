Work to widen the seven-mile section of the A453 between the M1 junction 24 in Leicestershire and the A52 in Nottinghamshire has been going on for a year.
So far a total of 409 people have worked on the project and 60% of those have come from the region.
In addition, £21.5m worth of orders for material and services have been placed with sub-contractors based within 50 miles of the A453.
BBC East Midlands Today's Sarah Teale reports.
