Rimini medieval work saved for nation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A rare medieval panel by Italian artist Giovanni de Rimini has been saved for the nation thanks to a donation from a US businessman and philanthropist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scenes From the Lives of the Virgin and Other Saints, painted around 1300-1305, was in the Duke of Northumberland's Alnwick Castle collection until 2014.
It was then sold at auction and a temporary export bar was put in place.
Ronald S Lauder provided the funds to enable the National Gallery to buy the work to the tune of Â£4.91m.
The deal means that the panel will be loaned to Mr Lauder during his lifetime but it has been agreed that the work will return regularly to the National Gallery during this period - this will initially be in 2017, and then up to once every three years after that.
When Mr Lauder dies, the painting will return to the National Gallery permanently.
National Gallery director Sir Nicholas Penny said: "We are very grateful to Mr Lauder.  He has helped us to find an imaginative way of sharing this rare and exquisite painting.  His generous gift to the National Gallery, to the British public and to all visitors to this great collection is an act of extraordinary generosity."
Giovanni da Rimini was one of a small group of artists who, for a short period in the early 14th Century, made the Italian port city of Rimini a centre for some of the most innovative painting in Europe.
Surviving paintings by members of the School of Rimini are rare, and paintings by Giovanni - considered the most talented member of the group - are exceptionally so.
