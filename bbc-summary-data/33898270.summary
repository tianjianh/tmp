The boy and girl were swimming in a large area of open water at Thorpe Marshes Reserve at about 16:50 BST when they went missing.
A coastguard helicopter joined police and ambulance staff searching the area, but the pair were later found dead.
Chief fire officer Nigel Williams, from Norfolk fire service, said: "Tragically there was nothing we could do."
He added: "My heartfelt condolences, and those from every firefighter at the scene, go out to the family at this terribly sad time."
The pair were swimming in open water when they got into difficulties.
Ch Insp Nathan Clark, of Norfolk police, said: "We were alerted to two people struggling in the water. There was a coordinated effort to locate them but unfortunately the two teenagers were found dead.
"We are very much keeping an open mind about what happened and are interviewing people at the scene, including family members.
"I would like to offer all my sympathies to them. I can't imagine anything more tragic than losing two teenage kids."
The BBC understands the victims were a 14-year-old boy and a 16-year-old girl.
Kerri Howard, who lives nearby, witnessed the aftermath of the search operation.
She said: "I saw some people coming out in cars and heard a lady coming over the bridge screaming. They all went away quite quickly."
Nikki Fox, a BBC Look East reporter who was at the nature reserve, said: "Two ambulances left the scene with the two bodies just before 21:00.
"A small crowd of people had gathered to watch the search operation. People were visibly upset."
She said she saw a woman and a child wrapped in towels leaving the water.
The marsh, to the east of Norwich, is run by Norfolk Wildlife Trust and is described as its "first truly urban site".
Its website says the reserve has a "large area of open water" known as St Andrew's Broad.
