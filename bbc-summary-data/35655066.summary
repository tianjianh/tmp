But when the dust settles where will Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton at Manchester Arena on Saturday rank in the pantheon of all-British bouts?
BBC Sport takes a look at the best of British over the years.
Cooper's British, European and Commonwealth titles were on the line against the younger Bugner.
Cooper had looked to have successfully defended those belts but the fight was awarded to Bugner, who won the 15-round bout by a quarter of a point.

Benn put his WBO middleweight belt on the line to face Eubank at Birmingham's NEC.
A brutal encounter ended when Eubank stopped Benn four seconds from the end of the ninth round.
Referee Richard Steele later said: "This was the most dramatic fight I've ever refereed."
The fight was the first time that two British boxers had faced each other for the world heavyweight title.
On the line was Lewis' WBC heavyweight title and the build-up was dominated by Bruno questioning how British Lewis was. Lewis had won Olympic gold for Canada as an amateur.
Lewis went on to win the fight in the seventh round by technical knockout.

Benn had won the WBC super-middleweight title and with Eubank's WBO middleweight crown also on the line, the fight became a unification showdown.
The fight ended in a draw with scores of 115-113 Eubank, 113-115 Benn, and 114-114, and both fighters kept hold of their titles.
It was one of the most watched fights of all-time, with 16m tuning in on television.
The rivalry began when Haye and Chisora brawled at a news conference in Germany, following Chisora's WBC heavyweight title loss to Vitali Klitschko.
That set up a widely hyped grudge match, which was sanctioned by the Luxembourg Boxing Board, after the British Boxing Board of Control refused to legitimise the fight.
Haye defeated Dereck Chisora with a fifth-round knockout.
