Oakford, 25, was chosen for the Olympic pre-qualifier against the Netherlands.
"Two, three years ago I was sat in an office doing photocopying and making teas for people," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"I wasn't too sure that I'd get to represent a great club like Nottingham, let alone be in the national team."
Oakford, who played for Bracknall before joining Panthers in 2014, added: "For me to come here, it's just an amazing experience and I can't wait."
