Despite the disappointment of defeat, Wales achieved their best-ever performance at world level.
Sian French scored for Wales against Italy, who are the highest-ranked team in the tournament.
"Yet again we've been able to compete positively against higher-ranked nations," said coach Kevin Johnson.
"Our development as a group continues to grow at a fast rate.
"All in all, we have got what we have wanted from the tournament and have earned valuable world ranking points on the way to a top-four finish."
Wales beat Thailand 3-0 and Kazakhstan 2-1 before losing 2-0 to Ireland in the semi-final.
