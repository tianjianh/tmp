Hundreds of kids at a school for blind children have been given the chance to get up close to the Paralympic torch.
The torch has four sides which represent the Paralympic values - courage, determination, inspiration and equality.
This is one of the torches last stops on its week long tour of Brazil.
Martin is in Rio and sent us this report.
