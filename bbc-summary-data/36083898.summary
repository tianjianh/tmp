The 25-year-old, born in Pretoria, has a first-class batting average of 50.67 from 79 first-class innings.
The former South Africa Under-19 international has also taken 21 wickets in 38 Twenty20 matches and has played for the Northerns and the Titans.
"I'm excited to be here. It's an opportunity of a lifetime," he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
"I qualify to play as a local now. My wife is British - that's the route I can qualify to play for the county team.
"Hopefully if I have a good season I can maybe push to play for England."
Gloucestershire head coach Richard Dawson told the club website: "It is brilliant to have Graeme join our squad for the next couple of seasons.
"He has a proven track record and will add to the competition for places."
