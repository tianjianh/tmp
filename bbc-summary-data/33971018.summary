Fresh talks are being held in a bid to avoid walkouts by rail workers at First Great Western.

The train operator is locked in a long-running dispute with the RMT union over the introduction of new Hitachi Inter City trains.
Union members, including guards and platform attendants, are set to start a 24-hour strike on Saturday.
A further 72-hour walkout has been scheduled over the bank holiday weekend from 29 August.
Members who work on maintenance will take action on 29 August and 31 August.
All of the strikes will begin at 00:01 BST and end at 23:59 BST.
A 48-hour strike last month, over the same dispute, caused disruption to tens of thousands of commuters.
It affected high-speed services between London Paddington, south Wales, the Cotswolds, the Thames Valley region and the West of England.
The RMT union said the action was in response to a "lack of assurances" over job protection for engineers.
It also said it was concerned that the role of guards and platform staff would be diluted by plans for drivers to operate train doors, while it was angry at the proposed removal of buffet cars.
First Great Western has denied there would be job losses and said the new trains would have more seats and deliver faster and more frequent journeys for passengers.
