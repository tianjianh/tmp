The William Haggas-trained youngster (11-4) led from the front and stayed on to win by a length and a half.
Yucatan (11-8) gave trainer Aidan O'Brien his fourth successive runner-up in the Doncaster race finishing a head in front of Salouen (16-1) in third.
Rivet was immediately quoted at odds of 16-1 for next year's 2000 Guineas.
"I just let him stride on and enjoy it - it would have taken a good one to get by him," Atzeni said.
"He's very genuine and he stays well. He's a lovely, big horse.
"He'll definitely go on (next season)."
Atzeni is now one behind Lester Piggott's record five victories in the race. Piggott is part owner of Rivet.
