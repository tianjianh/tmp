[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's transport minister has claimed there is a "well developed" plan in place to deal with disruption caused by rail strikes.

Humza Yousaf was speaking after a meeting of the government's resilience committee looked at what will happen when strikes clash with major events such as T in the Park and The Open.
The next RMT strike takes place on Sunday and Monday - days when many people will be travelling home from the music festival.
Further strikes clash with The Open, which is taking place at Royal Troon between 14 and 17 July.
The railway union is backing industrial action over concerns about the operation of more trains without guards.
ScotRail said it would always schedule a second person on trains.
It also claimed that 59% of its customers currently travel on a train where the doors are safely opened and closed by the driver.
Mr Yousaf said: "It is disappointing to see these strikes continue to affect commuters who simply want to go about their everyday lives without any further rail disruption.
"I would once again urge both parties to come together, get back round the table and resolve this dispute.
"This latest round of RMT strikes coincide with some of Scotland's major summer events, most notably T in the Park, The Scottish Open and The Open. However, transport planning for these events is well developed with information available to let people plan their journeys in advance."
