The 26-year-old former Norwich player has made 19 appearances for the Championship club this term.
Fer, capped 11 times by the Netherlands, has previously played for Dutch clubs Feyenoord and FC Twente.
He joins Sandro and Charlie Austin in leaving Loftus Road in the transfer window, while Swansea have also added Chievo striker Alberto Paloschi.
Swansea sold England midfielder Jonjo Shelvey to Premier League rivals Newcastle for £12m in January.
On Monday, Portugal international striker Eder left the south Wales club to join French side Lille on loan for the rest of the season.
Fer joined QPR on a three-year deal in August 2014 from the Canaries, for a reported £8m.
He was part of the Rangers side that was relegated from the Premier League last season, and he was also relegated with Norwich in the previous campaign.
A QPR statement said Swansea paid an undisclosed fee for the loan.
