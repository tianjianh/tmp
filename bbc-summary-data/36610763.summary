Williams, prop Gethin Jenkins (calf) and flanker Josh Turnbull (shoulder) returned home early from the tour.
But Williams is Blues' biggest concern as they prepare for the 2016-17 season.
"The scrum-half has now undergone successful surgery to repair the damage and will begin a rehabilitation process," read a Blues statement.
Williams failed to make it on to the pitch on Wales' tour, having won the last of his 27 caps off the bench in their 27-13 defeat by England on 29 May.
