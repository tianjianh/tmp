The Spaniard's victory at Sepang matched Australian Mick Doohan's record of most premier class victories in a single season, set in 1997.
It was the 21-year-old's first victory in five races with Italy's Valentino Rossi finishing second and Spain's Jorge Lorenzo third.
The result sealed the constructor's title for Marquez's Honda team.
Rossi consolidated second place in the championship standings, 12 points ahead of his Movistar Yamaha team-mate Lorenzo.
The pair will battle it out in the  last race of the season in Valencia after Spain's Dani Pedrosa crashed out to fall out of contention.
Marquez, who sealed his second MotoGP title in Japan two weeks ago, had not won a race since Silverstone on 31 August.
On Saturday he had become the first rider to secure 13 poles in a season.
In front of a crowd of 80,000, in searing temperatures, Marquez didn't have the best of starts, dropping back to sixth on the first lap after running wide.
Lorenzo surged into the lead but Pedrosa crashed twice, retiring after the second incident.
Rossi took the lead halfway through the race and looked set for back-to-back victories, while Marquez also passed Lorenzo.
Two laps later Marquez pushed in front of the seven-time champion and took the chequered flag 2.445 seconds clear of Rossi.
The final race of the season takes place in Valencia on 9 November.
