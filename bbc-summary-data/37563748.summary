Edinburgh Zoo has confirmed its female giant panda Tian Tian will not give birth to a cub this year.

Keepers said the animal's hormone levels and behaviours show she has reached the end of her breeding cycle.
Two giant pandas arrived at the zoo five years ago but have so far failed to produce a cub.
Tian Tian, which means Sweetie, and male Yang Guang (Sunshine) were the first giant pandas to live in the UK for 17 years.
The last pandas in the UK, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, left a zoo in London in 1994 after failing to mate.
Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS), said: "It now appears clear that Tian Tian, our resident female giant panda, will not give birth to cubs this year.
"Tian Tian's hormone levels are returning to normal and her behaviours signal the end of her breeding cycle for this year.
"Over the next few weeks we will conduct a thorough review of the scientific data and our processes to ensure we learn from this year's breeding season.
