[SN]TITLE[SN]
Millwall 1-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Football League newcomers Barnet stunned Millwall, with Andy Yiadom's extra-time goal sealing victory in the first round of the League Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Akinde scored a penalty early on for the League Two side after he had been fouled by Byron Webster.
Steve Morison then missed a penalty for Millwall before making amends 15 minutes later with a neat back-header from a Shaun Williams free-kick.
But Barnet wrapped up victory with Yiadom's tap-in from Akinde's cross.
