The ??88m scheme will make a three-mile section of the A160 between the A180 and Immingham a dual carriageway.
The A180 slip roads at Brocklesby Interchange will close overnight at 20:00 BST on Monday evening.
Previously Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce has said the scheme was vital to the region's economic growth.
Highways England has released a computer-generated flythrough of the full project, which is anticipated to take about 16 months to complete.
Ben Ridgeon, of Highways England, said: "Once this scheme has been completed, traffic congestion will be reduced, journey times will become more reliable, and safety will be improved for road users and the local community.
"There will also be better access to the Port of Immingham and the surrounding area."
The westbound entry and exit slip roads of the A180 will be closed between 20:00 on Monday, 20 July and 06:00 BST on Tuesday, 21 July.
Drivers will be able to follow a signed diversion along the A180 eastbound at Brocklesby Interchange, exit at Stallingborough and return. Drivers should allow an extra 10 minutes for their journey.
Councillor David Watson, who is responsible for the environment and housing, said: "We handle more cargo in our ports than in any other port complex in the UK, and the building of this link road is vital to the work the Port of Immingham.
"The new road will further cement the role the area is playing in establishing the Humber the UK's energy estuary, through the offshore wind industry, biomass power plants and the production of biofuels."
