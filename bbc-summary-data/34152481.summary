SSE Airtricity to bring down gas prices by 10%

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
SSE Airtricity, which supplies gas to about 125,000 customers in greater Belfast, is to cut prices by 10%.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The price cut will come into effect on 1 October and follows an 8% price cut in April.
The company said the latest reduction will save a typical household customer Â£58 a year.
The reason for the price cut is the continuing fall in wholesale gas prices.
Utility Regulator chief executive Jenny Pyper said: "I very much welcome SSE Airtricity's announcement that it is to reduce gas bills for its greater Belfast customers.
"The lower bills will benefit households and businesses as we enter the winter months.
"This means that standard gas tariffs in the greater Belfast area continue to be among the lowest in the UK or Ireland."
The Consumer Council has welcomed the price cut.
Richard Williams, head of energy, said "The cost of energy remains the top concern for consumers, so we welcome the news that SSE Airtricity are reflecting the sustained fall in the wholesale cost of gas.
"Households in greater Belfast can choose between two natural gas suppliers; SSE Airtricity and Firmus Energy. The Consumer Council would therefore encourage all customers to check if they are getting the best possible deal and whether they can make savings by switching their supplier."
