[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 0-1 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Genaro Snijders' strike gave Notts County their first win in four games as they extended struggling Newport County's run without a win to 10.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dutch forward capitalised on poor Joe Day's error to strike the ball into the corner of Newport's net.
Souleymane Coulibaly went close for County in the second-half while Scott Boden and Medy Elito had efforts saved.
But Day had to keep Newport in the game as the hosts' keeper saved well from Jon Stead and Filip Valencic.
Newport County manager Warren Feeney:
"I don't think we played that badly but we lacked that quality and we got done by a mistake - and if you give mistakes away, you will lose football games.
"It is the end of season and we are safe but we just can't carry on giving away silly goals. It's that little bit of quality and decision-making we lacked today."
