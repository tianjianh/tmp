The Surrey village team play in the Isthmian League Premier Division, the seventh tier of English football.
Southern League Chesham, also from the seventh tier, face a trip to League One club Peterborough United.
Ninth-tier Westfields will face Curzon Ashton, who upset York City 2-1 in Monday's replay, with ties to be played on the weekend of 5-6 November.
The Midlands League Premier Division club, formed in 1966 following England's World Cup triumph, are the lowest-ranked team left in the competition.
"We are delighted we are at home, six home games on bounce now this season," Westfields chief executive Andy Morris told BBC Sport before the Curzon Ashton result. "I'm quietly confident with a home draw.
"Getting this far is a huge bonus - we have earned enough money so far to get us through this season and keep us going into next season."
Merstham had offered free drinks in their clubhouse from 19:00 BST until their ball, number 79, came up, but the Moatsiders' generosity was presumably shortlived as they were the fourth tie drawn.
Meanwhile, Spennymoor Town of the Northern Premier League will travel to League One MK Dons, while Stamford, who play one level below Spennymoor in the NPL South, will make the trip to Hartlepool if they overcome Wrexham in Tuesday's fourth qualifying round replay in north Wales.
"What an occasion. It is all a reward for the hard work and fantastic opportunity for the supporters to go to the game and hopefully see us win," said Spennymoor manager Jason Ainsley.
