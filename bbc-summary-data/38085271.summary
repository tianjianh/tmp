Wales v South Africa: Sam Warburton ruled out by training injury

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Warburton will miss Wales' game against South Africa on Saturday after suffering an injury in training.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
His place in the back-row is taken by Dan Lydiate, with Justin Tipuric restored to the open-side and Taulupe Faletau on the bench after injury.
Leigh Halfpenny moves to full-back after playing on the wing in the 33-30 win over Japan.
Scott Williams is preferred at centre to Jamie Roberts in a side showing one change from the win over Argentina.
Loose-head Gethin Jenkins is captain after recovering from a shoulder injury.
Warburton missed the opening game of the autumn series against Australia as he recovered from shoulder and neck injuries, but played in the wins over the Pumas and Japan.

Faletau appears in the squad for the first time this autumn having played an hour for Bath against Bristol following a knee injury suffered in September.
Halfpenny's return to the number 15 shirt sees Liam Williams move to the wing.
Dan Biggar returns at fly-half, with Sam Davies - whose last-minute drop goal clinched the win against Japan - getting the nod ahead of Gareth Anscombe on the bench.
"Sam [Warburton] had a stinger on Tuesday afternoon in training and it's the same injury he had when training with the Blues," said Howley.
"He felt he would get through the next 24-48 hours, but the medical staff saw him yesterday and this morning and it's just a wise decision that he won't be fit - it's much too early.
"We looked at the back-row and in light of playing against South Africa Dan Lydiate, who played well at the weekend has come into that number six position."
Howley added he had not  been tempted to start Faletau in the back row.
"Not really because he's played 45 minutes for Bath," said Howley.
"The impact he would have - he's a world class player - to come off the bench - it will be big from Toby and in terms of what we're expecting from South Africa we felt this was the best way to go."
Liam Williams' move back to the left wing comes after the player was unimpressed with his own display against Japan, according to Howley.
"I spoke to Liam after the weekend. He was very disappointed with his performance," he added.
"I talked about him being a connection in the back field and the way we defend, I think the amount of work Leigh Halfpenny does on and off the ball [is significant] and Liam's a very intuitive player.
"There's an X-factor about Liam and probably in terms of his ability to add value in the wider channels, but Leigh Halfpenny is equally important and for me that is the best back three.
"Liam is probably a left wing who can play full-back, where I think Leigh Halfpenny can play both."
Wales: Halfpenny; North, J Davies, S Williams, Liam Williams; Biggar, G Davies; Jenkins (capt), Owens, Francis, Charteris, Wyn Jones, Lydiate, Moriarty, Tipuric.
