Keith Lowe and Joshua Hack lured Brendan Mason to Abbey Park in Leicester where they beat him, stripped him naked to get rid of evidence, then left him for dead.
Mr Mason, 23, died in hospital after suffering 99 injuries.
Lowe, 22, and Hack, 21, were given life sentences at Leicester Crown Court.
Lowe will serve a minimum of 21 years and Hack will serve a minimum of 20 years and six months.
Hack admitted murder while Lowe changed his plea to guilty after video evidence emerged during his trial of him landing blows on Mr Mason.
Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC said the defendants filmed the attack for a third party to view and footage shows Mr Mason's naked and bloodied body on the ground.
Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Mason's aunt Sarah Chambers said: "It is not right how two evil people can do such a horrific thing and leave a massive hole in our lives that will never be filled again.
"Brendan was a lovely young man and he was so happy.
"Even though Brendan had numerous learning difficulties and was very easily led by others, he always knew right from wrong."
The court heard Lowe, of Rockingham Close, Leicester, and Hack, of St Helen's Drive, Leicester, had been friends of Mr Mason and planned to assault him.
Judge Michael Chambers QC said the attack on 5 July "was an intention to cause extremely severe violence and injury".
"You [Lowe and Hack] subjected him [Mr Mason] to a brutal and sustained attack in which you caused him great pain and humiliation," he said.
"Brendan Mason was only 23 with his life before him. You subjected him to a merciless attack with extreme violence."
Judge Chambers described the footage, which was not shown in court, as "chilling and deeply disturbing".
