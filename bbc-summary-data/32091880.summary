Carl Froch: WBA champion to pursue acting career

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch is set to take his first steps on the road to Hollywood stardom while he considers his future in boxing.

Froch, 37, will make his screen debut in a film called Once Upon a Time In London.
The Nottingham fighter has consulted industry legends such as Samuel L Jackson for tips and said he will play a "tough guy or a villain".
"I'll probably be chucking someone in the River Thames," said Froch.
Froch, who admits he is "in a bit of a dilemma" whether he should continue his boxing career, would not be the first fighter to swap the sweat of the gym for the glare of the camera.
Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson played a cameo role in recent Hollywood hit The Hangover, while Irish former middleweight champion Steve Collins held a minor part in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.
"I'm by no stage of the imagination an actor, I don't think you're listening to the next Robert De Niro," Froch told BBC Radio 5 live.
"[Former footballer] Vinnie Jones did well out of it, I think [former Commonwealth diver] Jason Statham did well from no real experience and they've gone on to have good careers.
"When I was on the Jonathan Ross Show I met Sir Ben Kingsley - acting royalty - I've met Samuel L Jackson, Michael Douglas. I've been talking to them and asking how they got into it. Nobody became a superstar overnight.
"A lot of the time they play themselves, so that was the advice: be yourself."
Froch, who has 33 wins from 35 fights, last competed when he knocked out George Groves at Wembley Stadium in May 2014.
He has since appeared on BBC gymnastics show Tumble and said he was envious of former Manchester United striker Dion Dublin, who has landed a role presenting Homes under the Hammer.
He vacated the IBF world title earlier this year and fellow Briton James DeGale will now fight American Andre Dirrell for the belt on 23 May.
Froch added: "The only two things left for me to do would be to fight at the Nottingham Forest City Ground that'll hold 30,000 and they'll be all loyal my fans, or in Las Vegas.
"[Mexico's] Julio Cesar Chavez Junior is fighting in April and that's a fight that could still happen for me in August or September."
