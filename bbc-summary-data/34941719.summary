Jayne Hickey and her son Christian were shot when two men knocked on their front door in Gillingham Road, Salford on 12 October.
Police have linked the shooting to armed feuds between gangs.
At the top of Christian's letter to Santa it says "help the police catch the people who hurt me".
Det Ch Supt Russ Jackson said the letter was "heart-wrenching".
"What happened to Christian will stay with him for the rest of his life but what we can do is try to make this up to him by finding those responsible and bringing them to justice.
"These people have absolutely no place in civilised society and we remain as determined as ever to find them," he added.
Christian and his mother have undergone surgery and are both now recovering at home, police said.
It is thought the gunmen were looking for Christian's father. No arrests have been made in the investigation.
