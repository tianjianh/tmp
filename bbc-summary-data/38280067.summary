The 21-year-old from Sheffield, who was fourth at the Rio Olympics, clocked four minutes 00.66 seconds, beating Joe Roebuck's 4:01.63 from 2009.
"Honoured to be on the podium, what a great way to end an amazing 2016! A cheeky British record too," he tweeted.
Gold went to defending champion Daiya Seto of Japan, who won in 3:59.24.
Litchfield's success followed earlier medals for team-mates Andrew Willis and Georgia Davies.
Welsh swimmer Davies, 26, won bronze in the 100m backstroke and Englishman Willis, 26, took silver in the 200m breastroke.
