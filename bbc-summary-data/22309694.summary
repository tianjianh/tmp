Rivals Manchester United won the title with a 3-0 win over Aston Villa on Monday, leaving City 16 points behind.
"You should move very quickly. We didn't do this last year," admitted 48-year-old Mancini.
"We moved so slowly. We lost the players that were our targets to improve our team."
Earlier this month, Mancini questioned the club's transfer policy, commenting: "I think we had the chance to win another Premier League if we worked well last summer but we didn't."

With five games left in the league, City are five points ahead of third-placed Arsenal with a game in hand.
"I think that when you build your team you need to start like in this case, in the end of this championship. We have time, but not a lot of time. We should have our targets in mind," the Italian added.
On Manchester United's 20th title victory, Mancini said: "United have more attitude than us, as a club, as a team. We had big problems with players injured.
"They did better than us, they won a lot of games in a row, it was really difficult."
City have the chance to win silverware for the third successive season when they face Wigan in the FA Cup final on 11 May.
