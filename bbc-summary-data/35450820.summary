[SN]TITLE[SN]
Police appeal in 1972 Lenton sex abuse case

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An appeal has been made for a potential witness in a sex abuse case in 1972 to contact police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, who is only known by her first name, Elizabeth, is being asked to contact Nottinghamshire Police.
Officers investigating an historical allegation of sexual abuse want to speak to her.
The woman was in living foster care at a house in Derby Grove, Lenton, at the time. She was not a victim of any crime herself.
The woman would have been in her mid-teens at the time.
DC Rory Greer, of Radford Road CID, said: "We appreciate that much time has passed since the alleged offence took place, but it has still required enormous courage from the victim to come forward and speak to us now.
"We are determined to help the victim to take this case forward and it appears Elizabeth may have important information about what happened in this house more than four decades ago.
"She may no longer live in the Nottingham area, but hopefully the year and the location will help her or someone who knows her to contact us."
