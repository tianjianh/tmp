[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andre George, 27, was approached by two plain clothes officers after they spotted him dealing drugs from a car in Cambridge last November.
After the officers identified themselves, George drove off, knocking Sgt Paul Street on to his car bonnet.
But Sgt Street managed to arrest George when the vehicle stopped, police said.
George, from Crome Road, London, was jailed for more than four years on Friday after admitting being concerned with the supply of Class A drugs and assault with intent to resist arrest.
Sgt Street, of Cambridgeshire Police, who was uninjured in the incident, said: "This was an extremely unpleasant experience which highlights the dangers that police officers face on a day-to-day basis.
"It is hard to explain just how frightening it was being on the bonnet of a vehicle travelling at speed.
"I think the sentence reflects the violent nature of this crime."
