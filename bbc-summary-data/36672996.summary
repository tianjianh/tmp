The 65-year-old man was on the number 90 bus at Inns Court Avenue in Knowle, on Monday night when a brick smashed through a window and struck his head.
The police said the man's condition had improved but his injuries were "still potentially life-changing".
The teenager attended a Bristol police station following an appeal.
An Avon and Somerset police spokesman said: "The boy was voluntarily interviewed and inquiries are ongoing.
"We're not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident but we are still keen to speak to anyone who witnessed it."
