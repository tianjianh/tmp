The Brazilian team Chapecoense was due to compete in the Copa Sudamericana final on Wednesday.
It is believed their plane ran out of fuel, and suffered an electrical fault.
Speaking to Bolivian channel Gigavision before take-off, one crew member praised the team for climbing to the top of the contest and reaching the final, saying "I think we'll return with good results."
Everton dos Santos Goncalves, striker for Chapecoense, is seen on the footage happily approaching him, saying "everything is fine because he is in charge".
The Bolivian TV interviewer is thought to be the sister of the co-pilot, Sisy Arias.
Interviewed by the channel, Ms Arias spoke of the importance of having a Bolivian company transporting a Brazilian team to Medellin. Many photos of the co-pilot, who is the daughter of journalist, Jorge Arias, have been posted on social media:
Only six of the 77 people on board the plane survived the crash. Three players were among the survivors, while 19 players and the coaching staff died.
