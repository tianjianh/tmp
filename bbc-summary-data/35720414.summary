The remains of Saima Ahmed, 36, were found on Saturday 9 January at Gogar Mount House in Gogarstone Road and on the edge of nearby Gogarburn Golf Club.
She left her home in Wembley on 30 August last year.
It is not yet known why she came to Edinburgh.
Her death is being treated as unexplained.
Her exact route is unknown but police believe she may have travelled to Hemel Hempstead, Birmingham and then on to Edinburgh.
Saima was described as Asian, about 5ft 5in, of medium build, with shoulder-length, straight dark hair. She was last seen wearing a dark long V-neck top, black trousers, black shoes and a black jacket.
Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean, of Police Scotland, said: "We have received only a small number of calls since we launched our appeal last week, which demonstrates the challenges we continue to face given the amount of time that has passed since Saima was reported missing.
"Saima's death remains unexplained as we continue to carry out various lines of inquiry.
"We're committed to doing everything possible to establish the circumstances surrounding her death and I thank the people who have come forward thus far.
"Today, I again ask anyone who has information that might assist with our ongoing investigation to contact police immediately.
"There are a number of matters we are working hard to establish and I believe the public will hold the answers.
"Even the smallest piece of information could have a huge impact in the wider context of the investigation."
