The BBC has learned that a man charged with a number of sexual assaults at a County Armagh medical practice is a GP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charges stretch over a number of years.
Dr Tony Chee worked at Richhill Health Centre up until 2011 when the practice severed its ties with him.
The police say the 45-year-old has been charged with sexual assault following a number of complaints that date from 2009 to 2011.
All the alleged incidents are said to have happened at the health centre.
Dr Chee will appear before Armagh Magistrates' Court next month.
As is normal procedure, the charges will now be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
The police say inquiries are ongoing and detectives are asking anyone who might have any information relating to the case to come forward and get in touch with the detectives at Newry on the non-emergency 101 number.
