Jo Cox death: What we know about the suspect

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Quiet, bit of a loner, keen gardener - these are the main observations from people who knew the man held over the killing of Labour MP Jo Cox.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Named locally as Thomas Mair, the 52-year-old was arrested by police close to the home where he lived alone in Birstall, West Yorkshire.
There are reports that he had a history of mental health issues and that as a young man, he may have had sympathy for far-right groups.
Witnesses reported that during the attack he shouted "Britain first" twice.
West Yorkshire Police said they would not speculate about the motive but the area's Police and Crime Commissioner, Mark Burns Williamson, called the killing a "localised incident".
The force said it was working together with the North East Counter Terrorism Unit on the investigation.
Mr Mair's name appears on a website listing him as a past subscriber to the SA Patriot - a magazine published by a South African pro-apartheid group.
The magazine issued a statement confirming that he appeared to have been a subscriber back in the 1980s, but said his subscription was not renewed and that those involved in the publication had never met him.
Meanwhile a US civil rights group, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), claimed it had obtained records showing Mr Mair had links with the US neo-Nazi organisation National Alliance (NA) between 1999 and 2003.
The anti-hate campaign group posted images on Twitter showing what it claimed were receipts issued to him for books published by the NA, including a manual on how to make a homemade gun and a guide to explosives.
Richard Cohen, president of the SPLC, told the BBC that Mr Mair had also subscribed to a variety of white supremacist, neo-Nazi literature that the NA put out.
"The material presents this view that Aryan, white people are superior, that they need to separate themselves from other races and they need to do so violently if necessary," he added.
Prof Matthew Feldman, an expert on fascist ideology from Teesside University, said the receipts "appear to be genuine, appear to be in the weeks after the first neo-Nazi bombing spree that had been inspired by the internet in 1999".
It has emerged that the gun used to shoot Mrs Cox was not homemade, but was a real weapon shortened in some way.
The UK political party Britain First, which boasts of its hatred of white left-wing politicians, has issued a video statement condemning the attack and says that it had no connection with the incident.
Mr Mair had lived alone since his grandmother died 20 years ago.
His brother Scott, 50, told reporters on Thursday that his brother had a "history of mental illness" but that "he has had help".
Scott Mair told the Sun: "We are struggling to believe what has happened. My brother is not a violent man and is not that political. We don't even know who he votes for. I am visibly shaken at this news. I am so sorry for the MP and her family."
Mr Mair's half-brother, Duane St Louis, 41, told ITV he believed his brother "wouldn't hurt a fly".
"He's never expressed any views about Britain, or politics or racist tendencies. I'm mixed race and I'm his half-brother; we got on well," he said.
Thomas Mair spoke to a local newspaper six years ago about how volunteering at a park in Birstall had helped him with his mental health issues.
"I can honestly say it has done me more good than all the psychotherapy and medication in the world," he said.
Friends and neighbours of Mr Mair's mother Mary Goodall told the BBC she was devastated by the news and had been unable to sleep.
They said they did not know him as someone who had long-term mental health issues, although he may have been treated for depression a long time ago.
Known to them as Tom, the neighbours said he went to visit Mrs Goodall once or twice a week to do shopping and cleaning.
Police forensics teams searched Mr Mair's home on Thursday while his neighbours in Batley also described their shock over the news.
One man said: "He's a very quiet person. He likes his gardening and stuff like that. He was a man of few words really."
Another neighbour said she had seen him outside the house on the morning of the attack. "He just walked past like he does," she said.
Friend and neighbour David Hallas said: "When his image came up on the screen me and my wife said, 'not in a million years'. Of all the people in Birstall that I know, he would've been at the bottom of the list."
He described him as shy, a loner, a "gentle, kind chap", a well-read man with whom he had talked politics and someone who never hinted at extremist views.
Marjorie Wallace, from the mental health charity Sane, said living alone and feeling disconnected from society was "fertile soil for extreme ideas, beliefs and hatred".
Loneliness was one of Mrs Cox's many campaigns both in her constituency and Westminster.
