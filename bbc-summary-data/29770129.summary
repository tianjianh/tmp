The cast of Geordie Shore have swapped the confines of a nightclub for a night at one of the UK's leading academic institutions.
Gaz, Vicky and James from the MTV show were invited to speak at the prestigious Cambridge Union.
They talked to students about their lives, parties and their status as reality TV celebrities.
Posting on her Instagram, Vicky Pattison said: "It was a real honour to be asked to speak there. I was so nervous but everyone was so nice."
The president of Cambridge Union, Tim Squirrell, live-tweeted the debate.
His feed shows that topics covered included their reputation, how the boys value women and the number of sexual partners Gaz has had.
They were also asked about why the show is popular and what they made of criticism that the show is too debauched.
At the end of the talk, the reality stars took the obligatory selfies with some of the students.
The Cambridge Union Society has a long history of debating events.
Former prime ministers including Winston Churchill, John Major and Margaret Thatcher have all spoken at the same venue before.
Harrison Ford, Russell Brand, Lisa Kudrow and Dame Judi Dench are among the famous actors who've done it too.
Now, that illustrious list can include Vicky Pattison, Gary 'Gaz' Beadle and James Tindale.
