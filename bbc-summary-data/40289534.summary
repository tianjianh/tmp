[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paddle boarding: Court of Arbitration for Sport to rule on future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) is to decide which organisation controls the increasingly popular sport of stand up paddle boarding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The sport involves athletes standing on a board and using a long paddle to move - a cross between kayaking and surfing.
The International Surfing Association (Isa) says it has organised competitions for years in the sport.
However, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) says the use of the paddle means it falls under its banner.
The sport has enjoyed huge growth in recent years and has been talked about as a potential Olympic discipline.
"We are pleased that the issue is now before CAS," said Isa president Fernando Aguerre on Thursday.
Surfing is one of five new sports to be included in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The Isa had unsuccessfully tried to include stand up paddle boarding in those Games as a surfing discipline.
