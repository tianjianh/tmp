Traffic between Scotland and England faced disruption over the weekend as the work was carried out removing Bothwellpark Road Bridge near Hamilton.
The structure had to be taken down so the motorway could be widened and a new bridge has been put in place.
Transport Scotland said the work had gone well and the M74 reopened just before midnight on Sunday.
A spokesman said: "The work to demolish the Bothwellpark road bridge has progressed well over the course of the weekend, with clean-up operations under way during Sunday.
"Transport Scotland would like to thank road users for heeding advice and staying clear of the area and for their patience while the work has been carried out."
The main part of the bridge was taken down overnight and on Saturday morning after the section of motorway between J4 Maryville and J5 Raith closed at 20:00 on Friday.
Signed diversons were put in place and extra rail services were laid on to reduce congestion.
