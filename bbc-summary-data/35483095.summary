Michael Scaife: Datchet bridge named after drowned son

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A bridge across the Jubilee River in Berkshire should be named after a man who drowned there, a council has agreed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Scaife, 20, died near the footbridge in Datchet in August.
A petition launched by his father, Mark Scaife, to name the bridge at The Myrke as "Michael's Bridge" attracted more than 2,500 signatures.
Eton Town Council initially opposed the plan, but voted in favour after an emotional plea by Mr Scaife.
He spoke at a council meeting on Thursday night at which councillors voted 8-2 in favour of naming the bridge.
Previously, objections had been raised by the authority because it said it could set a precedent for naming assets.
Mr Scaife said: "It was emotional, difficult, and there were lots of questions. But I felt sheer jubilation afterwards."
Mr Scaife had said the bridge, which is owned by the borough council and partially on land owned by Eton College, was already known by friends and family members as Michael's Bridge.
Last summer, his son jumped into the river with two friends.
He swam to assist when one got into trouble, but got into difficulty himself. His friends were able to swim to safety.
The Environment Agency and the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council have since installed buoys and safety signs in the area.
