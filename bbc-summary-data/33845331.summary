The organisers of Bristol's Balloon Fiesta have said they will look at what lessons can be learned after thousands had to be turned away from the site.

On Saturday evening the gates to the Ashton Court Estate had to be closed amid fears for crowd safety as the site neared capacity.
It was estimated up to 6,000 people arrived in one 15-minute period.
Fiesta chair Jane Oakland said she understood people's "disappointment and frustration".
The fiesta, on average, attracts 500,000 visitors over its four-day run.
But on Saturday, with blue skies and warm sunshine, thousands more descended on the site on the outskirts of Bristol.
Most of the routes became gridlocked and a bus shuttle to the site was suspended.
Alison Parks said she had left in plenty of time to see the balloons go up.
"It took us nearly four hours to get here... we've missed almost everything," she said.
Ken Jenkins, from Birmingham, had pre-booked parking but was told this was no longer available when he arrived.
He said: "We drove back to our hotel, which took another two hours.
"It was so shambolic we'll never come again, we didn't even manage to see the balloons go up."
Organisers said they could make it a ticketed event, but conceded this would mean an admission charge
"We have a very good traffic management system but if you were sat in those queues I'm sure it didn't feel like it," Ms Oakland said.
