[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff could become Wales' first "child friendly city" if it agrees a three-year partnership with Unicef UK.

The partnership would see the council work with the humanitarian agency on a "child rights partners programme".
It would give young people a say in policy decisions, the chance to design public spaces and ensure their rights are considered when delivering services, among other things.
The council said it would ensure children "feel they have a voice".
Phil Bale, leader of the council, said: "We want to deliver the best possible outcomes for children in our city, especially those children who are looked after or who have left care so they can be happy and lead a fulfilling life.
"Using the experience of Unicef UK, we hope to strengthen the voice of children looked after by the city council."
Unicef UK has been running five pilots of the child rights partners programme in the UK since 2013.
The council's cabinet will meet to discuss the proposal on Thursday.
