[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ten-man Chesterfield edged out Barnsley to boost their own survival chances and dent their hosts' play-off ambitions.

Lee Novak put the Spireites ahead, nodding in Gboly Ariyibi's cross, for his 14th goal of the season before Adam Hammill's deflected equaliser.
Jamal Campbell-Ryce was dismissed for two yellow cards, one for kicking the ball away, but Ollie Banks side-footed home to restore Chesterfield's lead.
Hamill then hit the post as Barnsley could not find a late leveller.
Defeat in their first league game since winning the Johnstone's Paint Trophy means Barnsley are now six points off the League One play-off positions.
Chesterfield, meanwhile, have now opened up a four-point gap between themselves and the relegation places.
