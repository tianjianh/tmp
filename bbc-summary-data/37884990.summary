China Championship: John Higgins beats Stuart Bingham in final

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Higgins reeled off three centuries from 7-7 to beat Stuart Bingham 10-7 in the final of the China Championship.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scot collected Â£200,000, the biggest ever victory cheque for a tournament outside the UK, after prevailing in a high-quality contest.
Higgins led 5-4 after the first session in Guangzhou, but 2015 world champion Bingham won the first two on the resumption before Higgins moved 7-6 up.
An 84 from Bingham levelled it but 134 and two more tons sealed Higgins' win.
It was the 41-year-old's first tournament win since last year's International Championship, also in China, but as an invitation title does not count towards his tally of 28 ranking crowns.
The world number six beat Mark Williams, Ali Carter and Mark Allen en route to the final, which featured five centuries in all and nine more breaks over 50.
