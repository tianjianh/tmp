[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield & Burton given FA fine for failing to control players

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield have been fined £12,500 and Burton Albion must pay £5,000 after admitting a Football Association charge of failing to control their players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The charge related to an incident which led to Huddersfield's Dean Whitehead being sent off during a 1-0 defeat at the John Smith's Stadium on 1 April.
Whitehead was given a second yellow card after a clash with Tom Flanagan.
Huddersfield have been handed a bigger fine after being punished for a similar incident against Leeds in February.
The FA said players failed to conduct themselves "in an orderly fashion" around the 88th minute of the Championship match.
Burton moved up to 19th thanks to Jackson Irvine's stoppage-time winner, four points off the relegation places.
