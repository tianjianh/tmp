[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's Catriona Matthew slipped out of the top 10 on the final round of the Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic in difficult conditions in San Francisco.

Matthew, ranked 70 in the world, had been on the fringes of contention throughout the first three rounds.
But the 46-year-old was among those who suffered the most on a windy final day as she carded a six-over par 78.
That sent her down into a share of 13th, ultimately 10 shots off the pace set by winner Haru Nomura, of Japan.
Matthew birdied the eighth, but that was a rare bright spot amid five bogeys and a double bogey on the par-four 16th.
Nomura completed her final round in 73, but that was still good enough for her to win by four shots from South African Lee-Anne Pace.
