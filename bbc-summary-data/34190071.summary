NHS mental health trust in Cornwall rated 'good' by inspectors

An NHS trust responsible for people with mental illness and learning disabilities has been given an overall rating of "good".

Inspectors said long stay and rehabilitation mental health wards for adults were rated "outstanding".
However, it did find problems with the mental health service for young people.
The lack of beds in the county for young people with mental illness has led to many being sent hundreds of miles away, say campaigners.
The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected the Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust in April.
The trust's chief executive, Phil Confue, described the assessment as "brilliant news" and said the ambition for the trust was "for all its services to be rated as outstanding".
However, the report said staffing problems at the child and adolescent mental health service and a high number of referrals meant some young people waited a long time to be seen unless they were in a crisis.
The report also highlighted a shortage of beds for acute adult admissions, and said patients sometimes had to be admitted to wards outside Cornwall.
Amber Cowburn, of the Invictus Trust, which was set up after her brother, Ben, took his life in an adult mental health unit in Cornwall in December 2010, said she was "astounded" by the report's findings.
"We're very shocked at the report - calling these mental health services in Cornwall 'good' is astounding to us really," she said.
"At any one time, 10-15 young people or children are sent out of the county to be cared for, often hundreds of miles away from their family because we don't have any facilities."
The CQC's deputy chief inspector of hospitals, Dr Paul Lelliott, highlighted child and adolescent care as an area that "needed improvement", but said the trust was "well led" and he was confident improvements would continue to be made.
