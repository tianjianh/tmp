[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A knitwear firm is considering ending its production operations in Hawick putting about 50 jobs at risk.

Managing director Daniel Kim said Peter Scott was looking at the move at its Buccleuch Street site.
It comes after a previous restructuring programme "failed to produce the projected financial results".
The proposal puts the majority of those employed by Peter Scott - owned by Northampton-based Gloverall - at risk of redundancy.
A statement said: "Trading has remained difficult and although there have been initial positive results this has not provided sufficient increases of income to maintain current staffing levels.
"Therefore the proposed job losses may become a necessary outcome to ensure that Peter Scott has a future in the golfing and High Street markets.
"The business strategy remains unchanged at this time as it continues to maintain the goal to supply the Peter Scott brand to its loyal customer base and increase its share in high value niche markets."
In an attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies, management said it would aim to meet with staff representatives "in an effort to find a workable solution".
The company currently employs 63 staff with 48 directly involved with production and affected by the change.
