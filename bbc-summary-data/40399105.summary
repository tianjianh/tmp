Three Salford high-rise blocks fail cladding fire tests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three high-rise buildings in Salford have failed the government's cladding fire tests following the Grenfell Tower disaster, said the city mayor.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Dennett said cladding at Arthur Millwood Court, Canon Hussey Court and Blackfriars Court "hadn't met requirements" and would be removed.
Work has already begun to remove cladding from nine tower blocks in Pendleton over safety concerns.
Village 135 in Wythenshawe also failed the government tests.
Tests are being carried out on 600 high rises across England following the fire in London, in which at least 79 people died.
The Grenfell Tower fire in north Kensington on 14 June started in a fridge-freezer, and outside cladding and insulation failed safety tests, police say.
Salford City Council said it had not yet received the test results for the Pendleton tower blocks.
The city mayor said: "Government tests are under way, but it is already clear the aluminium composite material on our blocks must be removed."
So far no buildings in Greater Manchester have been evacuated.
Cladding is typically fitted to the outside of high-rise buildings to improve their insulation and appearance.
