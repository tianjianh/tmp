Hull 2017: Musical Humber Bridge among City of Culture plans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A musical Humber Bridge, a 14th-Century masterpiece, a circus in a cemetery and the Spiders From Mars will be part of Hull's year as UK City of Culture.

The Â£32m programme will take over streets and venues throughout 2017.
Hull will celebrate famous local figures including poet Philip Larkin and director Anthony Minghella.
And it will put the spotlight on unsung heroines like 1940s and '50s boxing champion "Battling" Barbara Buttrick and pioneering musician Ethel Leginska.
Hull 2017 director Martin Green said: "Women's stories come through. It has traditionally been a male-dominated city, quite patriarchal. But we have found at every turn new stories about women."
Hull City Council leader Councillor Stephen Brady said the "explosion of culture and regeneration in this city has not been seen since the 1950s".
At Thursday's announcement of the line-up for the first part of the year, he said winning the City of Culture title had already changed peoples' perceptions of Hull.
"Our vision was to use the city's heritage and culture to create jobs and to put Hull back on the map as one of the great cities of northern England," he said. "That vision is fast becoming a reality."
The year will begin with an outdoor extravaganza from 1-7 January using projections and performances to tell the story of Hull.
Made In Hull will be co-ordinated by Hull-born Sean McAllister, who made Bafta-nominated documentary A Syrian Love Story. He is working with playwright and director Rupert Creed and Durham Marenghi, the lighting designer for the Rio 2016 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies.
Other highlights:
Will the Â£4.5m refurbishment of the city's Ferens Art Gallery in preparation for hosting the Turner Prize in 2017 transform Hull from an underappreciated outpost on England's eastern seaboard into a must-visit destination for tourists of all types? Unlikely.
And what about all the partnerships the city is enthusiastically making with the likes of the Tate, BBC and Royal Shakespeare Company - will they help turn Hull into a vibrant hothouse of creativity in the long-term? I doubt it.
So, isn't it all a bit of waste of money?
I don't think so. I accept the arts festival on its own won't change much. But its very existence might. It has the potential to transform the city.

Martin Green said Hull was "one of many cities in the UK that don't get their time in the spotlight".
"So people don't think there are stories to be told and things to be celebrated," he said. "The project of the UK City of Culture, to shine a light on a different city every four years, brings that to the fore.
"There are a great many stories and people you may or may not know.  So my hope by the end of the year is that no-one says 'Hull? Where?', that most people have been or are planning to come, and that we've proved there is a great quality of culture here and it's capable of staging something truly world class."
More events will be announced in due course. The UK City of Culture title is given to a different place every four years. Londonderry was the inaugural City of Culture in 2013.
