In a game of three penalties, Brad Inman put the Alex ahead on 59 minutes after George Cooper had gone down under goalkeeper Jordan Archer's challenge.
Gregory then levelled from the spot five minutes later after Byron Webster was fouled by Crewe keeper Ben Garratt.
But, when Oliver Turton handled late on, Gregory missed a chance to win it, firing his penalty against the post.
That enabled Steve Davis's Crewe to extend their unbeaten run to three successive draws.
In the week of their latest big money sale, Ryan Colclough's exit to Wigan Athletic, Crewe's latest new loan signing Ryan Seager made his debut as a late substitute.
Millwall manager Neil Harris told BBC Radio London:

"I'm disappointed not to win the game. We had enough chances to win one game, if not two.
"We had three excellent chances just before half-time and obviously it didn't quite happen.
"We limited Crewe's opportunities to get at us and the opportunities they got only really came from when we gave the ball away cheaply.
"Lee Gregory is disappointed. A couple of inches to the right and his second penalty would have gone in. He will continue taking penalties for us."
Crewe Alexandra manager Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke:
"We are having a right go. The next step is to turn these draws into wins, but we have something to build on.
"We competed well again, played some really good football at times and created some opportunities without being quite clinical enough.
"But I am disappointed and amazed by the penalty decisions. I am amazed at what we see from 60 yards away to what they see from 10 yards away. It happened at Wigan and it has happened again.
"I think the referee was influenced by the crowd and bowed down to the pressure. And the linesman gave the second one. He was further away than the referee, who didn't see it as handball."
