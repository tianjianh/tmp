The sports carmaker, owned by VW, is pushing to get its battery-powered model on to the market in 2019 and is spending about â‚¬1bn (Â£836m; $1.1bn) to get it on the road.
It wants to compete with the pioneering California-based Tesla for a share of the market.
Porsche admitted that finding staff for the project is tough.
"I'm not denying the battle for talent is tough," said Andreas Haffner, human resources boss at Porsche.
"One can in fact describe what is going on now as a 'war for talents'. We are in direct competition with other automakers and suppliers and IT firms in our global search for talented experts. Money alone is not enough to attract these creative minds."
Battling to overcome its diesel emission scandal, parent company VW has said it plans to launch 30 all-electric models to reposition itself as a leader in "green" transport.
The new jobs will be based at Porsche's plant in Zuffenhausen. Overall the company currently has more than 24,000 employees.
