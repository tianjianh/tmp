Owls striker Gary Hooper was brought down but Nuhiu's tame penalty was saved down low to his left by Alex Smithies.
The visitors took advantage at Hillsborough as Daniel Tozser's fierce strike gave QPR the lead.
However, Nuhiu atoned for his early miss as he guided Daniel Pudil's cross past Smithies just after the hour mark.
Despite Fernando Forestieri being suspended, Sheffield Wednesday took charge of proceedings from the kick-off with Kieran Lee and Ross Wallace both guilty of firing wide of the target.
As the visitors struggled to make headway at the other end, Smithies almost gifted the Owls the opening goal as he spilled Aiden McGeady's high ball into the box, only just managing to gather it at the second time of asking.
Having missing a number opportunities in the first half, Carlos Carvalhal's side were given the chance to take the lead from the spot three minutes into the second half - but failed to take advantage.
Buoyed with Smithies save, QPR began to play more expansively and Tozser's sublime strike was just rewards for a more adventurous five minutes from the away side.
Although Nuhiu grabbed the equaliser, more poor finishing saw Wednesday fail to pick up all three points, despite their overall dominance.
Sheffield Wednesday manager Carlos Carvalhal:
"I'm very happy with the attitude of the team and I'm very happy with the quality.
"We lost a little control for a short period of the game, between the penalty and their goal, but we had a strong reaction and scored to make it 1-1.
"We had some very good chances to score goals so it was our fault. We deserved to win but that is football."

QPR boss Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink:
"I'm very happy. If you come here and you see the way they've been playing here, you know it's going to be difficult.
"They are a very good side and we were under pressure. We were winning 1-0 and then it is a case of can you see it through?
"They played well and they will be disappointed to have not got three points.
