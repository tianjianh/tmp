Port Vale midfielder Danny Pugh has signed a new one-year contract with the relegated League One club, with an option to extend it when the deal expires in June 2018.

The 34-year-old ex-Manchester United trainee has been an ever present since making the first of his 13 starts following his signing in January.
Pugh had his contract terminated at League Two side Blackpool to join Vale.
He signed for the rest of the season, but has now made it more permanent.
Pugh, who has had spells with Leeds United, Preston North End, Stoke City, Sheffield Wednesday, Coventry City and Bury, is the first Vale player to commit his future to Vale since confirmation of Michael Brown's appointment as manager.
Brown was installed as new Vale manager on Wednesday, three days after the club's return to League Two, following four seasons in League One.
In what is expected to be a summer of departures at Vale Park, the first guaranteed exit will be defender Remie Streete, the club have confirmed.
Following "amicable discussions", the former Newcastle United youngster has turned down a new offer from the club as he wants to play at a higher level than League Two.
A club statement said: "Remie's contract was set to come to an end following the conclusion of the 2016-17 League One campaign.
"He has expressed his desire of wanting to play at the highest level that he can."
Streete, 22, one of Vale's most marketable assets along with young centre-back partner Nathan Smith, has scored six times in his 60 times for Vale since arriving from Newcastle, initially on loan, in 2015.
