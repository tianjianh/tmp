The 30-minute ceremony begins at 12:30 BST on Wednesday.
It will incorporate the Wreath of Respect and honour 255 British military personnel and three Falkland islanders who died during the conflict.
The event was organised by the assembly's Armed Forces and Cadets cross party group and officers from the 160th Brigade (Brecon).
The Wreath of Respect, a project set up on 2014, has travelled around the UK and overseas, where it is laid at memorials and sites connected to the military.
Lt Col Manny Manfred, who served as a paratrooper in the Falklands conflict, will deliver a speech reflecting on his service.
Britain accepted the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982.
Of those who died in the conflict, 48 were Welsh Guardsman and a further 97 were wounded.
Chairman of the cross party group, AM Darren Millar, said: "It is only right that we pay tribute to all those involved in the conflict, and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country."
