The opening party for the Dandy Diner created a big buzz on social media.
The Dandy Diary blog on Facebook said "police closed us down" - and added an expletive. The bloggers are regarded as male fashion trendsetters.
Police said about 300 people thronged the new diner and hundreds more were waiting outside on Saturday night.
Germany's Der Tagesspiegel daily says restaurant openings like that organised by the Dandy Diner entrepreneurs - Jakob Haupt and David Roth - "have rarely drawn such a big crowd" in Berlin.
The crowd spilled a long way down Karl Marx Strasse, in Berlin's Neukoelln district.
