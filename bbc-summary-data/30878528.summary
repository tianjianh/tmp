A songwriter called Katie Farrah Sopher claims Disclosure's White Noise, Latch and You and Me feature song words taken from her personal songbook, according to the Mail on Sunday.
Sopher is claiming a reported Â£200,000 in damages for the tracks.
She accuses ex-boyfriend Sean Sawyers of stealing the songbook and selling lyrics to music industry contacts.
The songwriter claims the book features lyrical content inspired by a "toxic" relationship with Sawyers.
In addition to the accusations towards her ex-boyfriend, Sopher is personally suing Disclosure and their collaborators on the three tracks; Sam Smith, AlunaGeorge and Eliza Doolittle.
White Noise, which features AlunaGeorge peaked at number two in the UK, while You & Me featuring Eliza Doolittle reached number 10.
Latch, got to number 11 in the UK and features Sam Smith.
All three of the tracks appear on Disclosure's number one debut album Settle.
Sopher, from East London, is also seeking damages from dance duo AlunaGeorge, both for their contribution to White Noise and because she claims she wrote lyrics which appear in their top 20 single Attracting Flies.
According to the Mail On Sunday, Sawyer denies all allegations and says he's never seen the book in question.
Newsbeat has contacted all of the artists accused of using Sopher's lyrics but there has been no comment.
