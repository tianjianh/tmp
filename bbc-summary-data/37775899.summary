[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inter Milan 2-1 Torino

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England goalkeeper Joe Hart made a costly mistake as Torino were beaten by out-of-form Inter Milan in Serie A.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hart, on loan from Manchester City, palmed Antonio Candreva's through ball into Mauro Icardi's shins and the ball ricocheted into the net.
It was captain Icardi's first goal since falling out with the club's ultras, who said he was dead to them.
Andrea Belotti capitalised on woeful defending to equalise before Icardi struck a drive into the top corner.
Victory ended a run of three league defeats in succession for Inter.
