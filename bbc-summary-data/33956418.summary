Police boarded a plane due to take off at Newcastle Airport after the crew claimed some passengers were drunk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Almost 70 passengers on Sunday's 14:25 BST to Stansted were delayed for about five hours after the incident.
Northumbria Police said four businessmen from London who were among a stag party were removed and spoken to by officers.
Flybe apologised for the delay, adding it had a "zero tolerance" approach to unruly behaviour on its flights.
A Northumbria Force spokesman said: "We were called by airport staff to help remove a group of drunk and disorderly passengers from a plane at Newcastle Airport.
"The group was escorted off the plane and spoken to."
No arrests resulted from the incident, but a 30-year-old man was reported for an offence under the aviation act.
A airline spokesman said: "Flybe sincerely regrets the inconvenience experienced by passengers.
"This resulted from the threatening and overly abusive behaviour exhibited towards the cabin crew immediately prior to departure, initially initiated by four members of a 13-strong stag party.
"As such, and in line with a zero tolerance policy with any form of on-board behaviour that might in any way compromise the safe operation of any flight, the captain reported the situation to the police who took the necessary immediate action.
"All 68 passengers were offloaded and those not involved in the incident were accommodated on an alternative flight."
Some passengers later took to social media claiming the incident had been overblown.
