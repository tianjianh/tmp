Zero-hours staff at Welsh Government HQ despite pledge

Night shift workers have been employed on zero-hours contracts at the Welsh Government's Cardiff headquarters, it has emerged.

The move by cleaning and security firm Vinci Facilities was criticised by the GMB union and comes despite a pledge from ministers to limit their use.
BBC Wales understands robust talks have taken place between Welsh Government and the company in light of concerns.
Vinci said short term arrangements are being phased out this month.
The company said it had "no intention" of using zero-hour contracts.
Zero-hours contracts allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of work - meaning employees work only when they are needed and their pay depends on how many hours they work.
Vinci took on cleaning and security work at the Welsh Government's large Cathays Park office complex in the summer.
The GMB union, which represents most of the staff, said a number of proposed changes to shift patterns were put to the workers a month ago, including limiting overtime and introducing more night-shifts.
Consultation with about 30 cleaners and 12 security staff is continuing.
In the meantime, the union claims about half a dozen new workers have been employed on zero-hours contracts on night shifts.
The union has filed an official grievance complaint and has begun talks with the conciliation service ACAS.
In the programme for government last month, under the heading of a Fair Society, the Welsh Government called for a limit to the use of zero-hours contracts and to tackle other "bad practices".
Nicola Savage, a regional organiser with the GMB, is opposing both the introduction of staff on zero hours contracts, and the proposed changes to the terms and conditions for the existing staff.
She said: "There are lots of Welsh Government staff who are upset about this. I don't think that ministers are aware of the current situation
"There are a group of staff who have been there for some time and these changes are going to significantly affect their working conditions, their earning capacity and their home lives.
"The potential reduction in their hours to such a level will push them into poverty.
"It's very upsetting and the Welsh Government should step in and do something about it now.
"If they are concerned about zero hours contracts they should stand true to their beliefs in bringing people out of poverty."
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "The Welsh Government is committed to limiting the use of zero-hours contracts across Wales.
"We will be working with Vinci Facilities and the GMB to ensure staff employed by the company do not have to rely on zero-hours contracts, and have appropriate terms and conditions."
