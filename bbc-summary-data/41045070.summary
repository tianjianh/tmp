The Northern Irishman, 28, carded three birdies and six bogeys in his first round at Old Westbury in New York.
The tournament is the first of four held over a five-week period which McIlroy intends to play in a bid to retain his FedEx Cup title.
He will also compete in the Dunhill Links event in Scotland.
After that, the four-time major winner has indicated that he will take an extended break to aid his recovery from a rib injury.
The FedEx Cup play-offs begin with the Northern Trust and, with McIlroy lying 43rd in the standings, he will need to move into the top 30 in order to earn entry to the concluding Tour Championship.
He won the second play-offs event in 2016 before clinching a Â£7.8m bonus as he topped the FedEx Cup standings after triumphing at the Tour Championship.
After this week's tournament at the Glen Oaks Country Club, the play-offs continue with next week's Dell Technologies Championship in Boston.
After a week's break, the series resumes with the BMW Championship in Illinois before the Tour Championship in Atlanta.
Henley leads compatriot and world number one Dustin Johnson by a stroke with Americans Scott Brown and Chris Kirk plus Camilo Villegas of Colombia two shots off the pace.
