Welshman Day took a 4-0 lead over the Scotsman only for Maguire to reply by winning the next two frames.
But after four previous defeats in finals in his 18-year career, the 37-year-old edged a cagey last frame to take the trophy.
Day had beaten fellow Welshman Mark Williams 5-4 to make the final.
Maguire beat Ireland's Ken Doherty 5-4 in the semi-finals to earn his chance against Day.
