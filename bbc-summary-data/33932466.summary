Chris Woakes: Birmingham Bears T20 success an "unreal" feeling

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham Bears all-rounder Chris Woakes has said reaching T20 Blast Finals Day for a second consecutive year is an "unreal" feeling.

Woakes made an unbeaten 48 from just 23 balls before taking 1-22 with the ball as Birmingham beat Essex by 24 runs.
The Bears are the current holders of the competition, having beaten Lancashire in last year's final.
"It's pretty unreal actually - I suppose it hasn't really sunk in," Woakes told BBC WM 95.6.
"It was a great performance by the lads, a full squad effort.
"Obviously some lads missed out tonight for some other guys to come in - and credit to them because they've put in some serious performances over the tournament."
