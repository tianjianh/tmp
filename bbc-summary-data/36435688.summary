She also told the court she passed Sub Lt Mitchell a tub of moisturiser which he massaged into her back, after he asked for some baby oil.
"This is one of the things I have struggled with, I became compliant, I cannot explain that", she said.
The court has heard that she had drunk four glasses of Pimms, a glass of red, wine, some Champagne, and a double gin and tonic and had been carried back to her room by her friends.
The complainant has described how she had been unable to "articulate" her wish not to have sex with the defendant, other than by remaining passive, crossing her arms across her chest and saying "no sex".
