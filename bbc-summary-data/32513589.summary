The company that ran a Belfast restaurant involved in a major E. coli outbreak has been fined £110,000.

At least 140 people contracted E. coli in an outbreak at Flicks restaurant, based at Yorkgate shopping centre, three years ago.
It was described at the time as the worst outbreak of E. coli in Northern Ireland's history.
Earlier this month, Yorkgate Movie House owner Michael McAdam pleaded guilty to 11 food hygiene breaches.
More than £300,000 has already been paid out in compensation to victims of the outbreak.
They have received payments ranging from £3,000 to £12,000.
The Public Health Agency's (PHA) report into the outbreak, released after the sentencing, found that a food handler who garnished the meals at Flicks was found to have had a "severe episode of diarrhoea whilst at work at the restaurant".
This, it said, may have contributed to the spread.
Speaking outside Belfast Crown Court, Mr McAdam said his company "fully accepts" the fine.
"I am personally devastated that any business of mine could have caused people to become ill," he said.
"I would just like to take this opportunity, once again, to say how deeply sorry I am to anyone who fell ill as a result of eating at Flicks restaurant."
He confirmed that the restaurant would not be reopening.
Flicks closed voluntarily in October 2012 after advice from the Belfast City Council's environmental health staff.
A spokesperson for the council said it was "extremely fortunate that no lives were lost" as a result of the outbreak.
The restaurant's failings included ensuring that food handlers were supervised, trained and instructed, that foods were protected from E. coli contamination, and that staff toilets were kept clean.
During several inspections at the restaurant, staff toilet facilities were found to be inadequate.
There was no soap or drying facilities for handwashing, and a basin could not be used as it was obstructed with other items.
The judge said that E. coli had the potential of causing death or serious injury to vulnerable customers, such as pregnant women and children.
During the outbreak, 141 cases were reported with a further 159 people reporting symptoms. Two staff were also found to have the same strain of E. coli.
Two customers were taken seriously ill and 44 others attended hospital, of which 16 were admitted.
The judge said this had a financial impact on the public purse.
He said the restaurant "showed a blatant disregard" for the food safety standards and therefore for the safety of its customers.
He added that while the actual location of the outbreak was not uncovered and no traces were found in Flicks, by the guilty pleas the company accepted "they were the source of the contamination".
The PHA report found that the source was either a contaminated foodstuff or an infected staff member.
It said there was evidence that chopped parsley was the cause, but there were "significant caveats" to this.
The PHA report concluded: "It is likely that poor practices within the restaurant contributed to the spread of E. coli."
