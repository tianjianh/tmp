Former Leeds Rhinos, England and Great Britain boss Smith is the longest-serving head coach in Super League, having joined Wolves in 2009.
The 49-year-old has won three Challenge Cups and one League Leaders' Shield during his time with the club.
"I think we have been a good fit for each other as coach and club," the Australian told the club website.
"We have come through a period of rebuild over the last couple of years and we've got some terrific young players with experience now.
"I think some of our best times are to come."
Warrington are currently top of the Super League table, level on points with second-placed Catalans and Wigan in third.
