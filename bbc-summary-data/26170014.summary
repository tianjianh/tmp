She will team up with director David Fincher, who is bringing her best-selling novel to the small screen.
Utopia, shown as a six-part series in the UK, centred on a group of people hunted by a mysterious organisation over a rare cult graphic novel.
The Channel 4 series sparked complaints about its graphic violence, but was cleared by Ofcom.
The majority of the complaints concerned the use of child actors to depict scenes of extreme violence.
The original 2013 series was created by Dennis Kelly, and a second series was commissioned by Channel 4 and is due to be shown later this year.
Fincher's big screen credits include 7even, Fight Club and the US film adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
He was also instrumental in remaking a US version of House of Cards for Netflix, winning an Emmy award and helping spark a revolution in TV production for subscription-only services.
Fincher's next release will be the adaptation of Flynn's Gone Girl, starring Ben Affleck as a husband whose wife goes missing on their wedding anniversary.
