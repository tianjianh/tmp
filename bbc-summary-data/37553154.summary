Luamanu, who was born in Wellington in New Zealand, made 18 appearances last season after joining the club from Treviso in July 2015.
"I'm really excited about moving forward with this extremely talented group of players. My family and I feel very much at home here," Luamanu said.
Harlequins have not revealed the length of Luamanu's new contract.
"I am very pleased that Mat has committed to the club going forward," said Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston.
"He has made a considerable impact with his physical presence and his professional approach to the game.
"There is far more to come from him and I am delighted it will be in a Harlequins shirt."
