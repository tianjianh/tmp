Wimbledon 2016: Pablo Cuevas fined for toilet threat and sit-in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A player who threatened to urinate in a ball can on court, then staged a sit-in protest during a match, has been fined almost £7,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uruguay's Pablo Cuevas was punished for unsportsmanlike conduct after the two incidents in a Wimbledon doubles game.
Partner Marcel Granollers was fined £5,800 for his part in the protest.
The pair lost Monday's third-round match 6-3 4-6 6-4 3-6 14-12 to Britain's Jonny Marray and Adil Shamasdin of Canada.
Cuevas was refused permission for a toilet break by umpire Aurelie Tourte, so threatened to relieve himself in a ball can on court - leading to his first code violation.
His second came when he hit the ball out of the court in frustration after double-faulting, which prompted his sit-down protest with Spaniard Granollers.
A supervisor had to be called to get the match started again and play was delayed for 10 minutes.
Cuevas was fined £3,100 and £3,850 for the separate incidents.
