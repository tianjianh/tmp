Wales number eight Sioned Harries and centre Hannah Jones crossed either side of a Scottish try for centre Megan Gaffney to give the hosts a 15-10 half-time lead.
Welsh flanker Alisha Butchers scored the only try of the second half to put the game beyond the battling visitors.
Scotland defended bravely but remain without a Six Nations win since 2010.
Centre Robyn Wilkins kicked eight points for Wales, while Scottish hooker Lana Skeldon scored five points from the tee.
Wales' first win of the campaign followed their opening defeat to Ireland.
They are back at The Gnoll on Sunday, 28 February to face France, while Scotland's next game is against Italy in Bologna on the same day.
