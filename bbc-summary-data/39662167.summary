The blaze started at a building in Tan House Lane, Widnes, at about 19:00 BST, Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service said.
There are 15 fire engines at the scene of the incident, which police said involves plastic and cardboard.
The site has been fully evacuated and roads surrounding the incident have been closed.
Residents have been advised to stay indoors and keep windows closed.
People are also being asked to avoid the area if possible as crews are expected to be there "for some time", the fire service said.
The smoke is not affecting Liverpool John Lennon Airport, around 15 miles away, a spokesman added.
