[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oldham Athletic 0-2 Wigan Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan maintained their 100% start to the season with a comfortable victory at north west rivals Oldham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors made it four straight wins in league and cup, but struggling Oldham have now suffered four consecutive defeats.
Wigan needed only eight minutes to go ahead as a short corner routine ended with Lee Evans crossing to Ivan Toney, who deflected home from six yards to register his first goal for the club.
The lead was doubled in the 16th minute, with Oldham's defence in disarray and Michael Jacobs seizing the chance to fire in a close-range drive.
It could have been 3-0 before half-time, but Nick Powell and Gavin Massey were both denied by home goalkeeper Ben Wilson.
Oldham had their best opening straight after the break when an Ollie Banks back-heel was smothered by Wigan goalkeeper Christian Walton.
Substitute Alex Gilbey wasted a chance to inflict more misery on the hosts, screwing off target from the edge of the box.
Ryan McLaughlin forced a save from Walton, but it was a largely untroubled afternoon for promotion favourites Wigan.
