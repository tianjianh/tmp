Anita Whitlock, 71, said she was left with an open wound for hours and in a wet bed at King's Mill Hospital.
She was admitted for treatment to an abscess but alleges she was ignored by staff and told she was stupid.
Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said it was "very sorry" she was unhappy with her care and was discussing the matter with her.
Ms Whitlock, from Newark, who is disabled and struggled to get in and out of bed after a major operation, said: "I just hated it, hated every minute.
"I told the nurse that my catheter is going to flood - she said 'don't be so stupid'.
Ms Whitlock also said she cried herself to sleep after staff "pushed me down" when helping her use a bedpan.
"I will never, ever go in hospital again, I'll die at home. I'm not going back, no way," she said.
Her carer Gail Weston said she was "furious" about what happened.
"If I wasn't there she wouldn't have eaten, drank or taken her medication because most of the time she couldn't reach it," Ms Weston said.
"One day we waited five hours for a dressing to come from the pharmacy, even though it's on site, so for five hours the wound was left open.
"It's just not acceptable."
In a statement, Phil Bolton, divisional nurse for emergency care and medicine at the trust, said: "We always take concerns about any aspect of patient care seriously.
"Mrs Whitlock has already been in contact with us regarding her care and we are discussing this with her directly."
