Ards still need point to secure Irish Premiership return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Championship One leaders Ards will go into their final match against Loughgall on Saturday still requiring one point to seal promotion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Niall Currie's men missed a chance to secure their Premiership return on Thursday night as they fell to a 2-0 defeat away to Knockbreda.
Early goals by Andrew Ferguson and Kyle Owens clinched the home victory on the Upper Braniel Road.
Ards remain three points ahead of second-placed H&W Welders.
Defeat for Ards at home to Loughgall on Saturday would give the Welders the chance to snatch the title on goal difference by beating Bangor.
The Welders do not have a Premiership licence, however, and would not go up to the top flight.
That would mean there would be no automatic relegation from the Premiership this season, and the club finishing bottom would go into a play-off with Ards.
