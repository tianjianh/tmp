[SN]TITLE[SN]
York City 2-1 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Newton struck in stoppage time to give National League bottom side York a 2-1 win over Barrow at Bootham Crescent.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amari Morgan-Smith, who recently joined York on loan from League Two side Cheltenham, netted in the 22nd minute after racing onto Jon Parkin's flick-on.
Parkin went close to doubling York's lead just before the break, with Barrow restricted to long-range efforts.
But just when rock-bottom York began to think the win was in the bag, Jordan Williams beat home goalkeeper Kyle Letheren to the ball and slotted home the equaliser.
But Newton's drilled strike gave the Minstermen a valuable three points.
