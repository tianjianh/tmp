Julie Saunders said she alerted staff after her son spotted a mouse sticking its head out from under a door at Hull Royal Infirmary.
She said: "It was a bit of a shock really, you don't expect mice in a hospital."
A spokesman at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust said a pest control team had been called in.

Mrs Saunders said staff put blankets along the bottom of the door to stop them getting in, while she put her legs up on the chair to avoid contact with the rodents.
She and her son spotted two mice, while other patients reported seeing four.
The trust said: "As a result of the incident we contacted our local pest control service immediately.
"The team are currently on site working hard to ensure any disruption is minimal and we are aiming to reopen the unit as soon as possible."
