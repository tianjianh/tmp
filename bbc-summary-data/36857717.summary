The 29-year-old was hurt during a pre-season friendly against League One club Oldham Athletic on Tuesday.
Scans confirmed the former Huddersfield player damaged both the medial and cruciate ligaments in his right knee.
"It's a big blow for us because he's been a consistent performer for us," the Championship side's manager Simon Grayson told the club website.
"It's going to be a difficult road for him, we have suffered quite a few long-term injuries really and I think the lads will get experience from other players and talk to them."
Preston finished 11th in the second tier last season, following their promotion from League One in 2014-15.
