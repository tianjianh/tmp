Jack Grealish: Aston Villa winger has 'sprinkle' of real quality, says Steve Bruce

Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce says Jack Grealish is making headlines "for the right reasons" after scoring the late winner against Wigan on Saturday.

The 21-year-old midfielder has been criticised for his off-field behaviour, with the club investigating his involvement in a party in September.
"Everybody's dancing home because they have witnessed a great goal," Bruce told BBC WM.
"He's got a little sprinkle of what could make him a very good player."
Bruce said Grealish is "a really good lad" who he wants to help as much as he can.
"It was truly a wonderful goal," Bruce added. "Imagine what it must be like to score a goal like that at Villa Park at 21. I never scored a goal like that in 30 years.
"But it is not easy for a 21-year-old. For any young player it is difficult especially in the bright lights in the second city in the country.
"All the distractions make it very difficult for any talented, young player, especially a good-looking one like him.
"He has that natural talent. He always looks he has time on the ball. But I want to try and improve him as a player. And he still has a long way to go."
Villa appeared to be heading for an 11th draw in 20 games until Grealish scored in the 87th minute, to record only his fourth goal for the club - and only the ninth of his career.
But it lifted improving Villa to 12th in the Championship, within three points of the play-off places.
