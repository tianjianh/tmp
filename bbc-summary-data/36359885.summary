Ben Turner says no negotiations were held between him and Cardiff City prior to his release, despite being willing to take a pay cut.

The 27-year-old suffered two injury-plagued seasons and was released along with Kenwyne Jones on Monday.
"There were never any negotiations. I won't say I was surprised but I'm genuinely disappointed," Turner said.
"I would have been open to structure my contract in a way that would have suited me and the club."
Turner returned from a loan spell with former club Coventry City in December after injuring his ankle for the fourth time in 16 months.
He made one appearance for the Bluebirds in 2015-16 in their end-of-season 1-1 draw with Birmingham but was told by chief executive Ken Choo he could find another club in January.
"Ken was honest, he said it was a business decision by the club and he thinks it's best that I look elsewhere," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"It doesn't make it any less disappointing for me. I've been at the club for five years and the first three years I didn't miss a beat. The disappointing thing is that I feel that the operation I have had now is what I've needed all along where I've got the right support in my ankle to go forward.
The defender continued, "I was hoping I'd be offered something and there could be a different way of structuring my deal.
"I wanted the chance to prove myself again and I'm going to have to do that elsewhere but that's life and it's disappointing."
Despite not playing many games in the last two campaigns, Turner believes he will be signed by a new club and prove his fitness.
"I'm confident I'll find another club. As far as I'm concerned, if my ankles are okay. I will be playing next season, make no mistake about it," Turner added.
"Whether at Cardiff or a new club, I have to prove myself in terms of my fitness but in terms of everything else, I still offer what I have done before."
