Michael Holt says making the last 16 of the World Championship for the second time is reward for his staying power.

The Nottingham potter secured a 10-6 win over world number four Neil Robertson to set up a second-round meeting with Mark Williams on Friday.
The 37-year-old had not gone beyond the opening round in six attempts since his Crucible debut in 2005.
"I have said so many times saying I know I can play," the world number 28 told BBC Sport.
"But water doesn't break through rock because it's strong, but because it's persistent.
"To go out there and feel comfortable was great. And it makes me want more."
Welshman Williams, a two-time world champion and good friend of Holt, stands in the way of a first-ever quarter-final appearance in Sheffield in a best-of-25-frame match.
"I can't wait to play Mark. I get on with him really well and I am sure there will be some texts flying about. But I need to concentrate on me," Holt said.
"It's a proper match. This isn't a best-of-seven. I can't wait. I felt comfortable out there and it makes me want more."
Holt also dedicated his win over Robertson to a close friend.
"A mate of mine Ian is poorly. He had an operation on his brain and has chemotherapy treatment soon so I just want to dedicate that to him," he added.
"He has a bigger fight than I have ever got trying to win a snooker match so love to him and I hope he pulls through."
