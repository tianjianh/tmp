The contract with Keepmoat is to build 316 new energy efficient homes, which the council said would provide a "jobs boost" for the area.
It is part of a project to construct 16,000 affordable and low cost homes over the next 10 years.
Work is expected to begin on the site in spring 2017, with council homes available to rent by spring of 2019.
Councillor Joan Griffiths, the housing leader for Edinburgh Council, said: "North Sighthill is one of the largest new house-building projects in Edinburgh, after the regeneration of Pennywell in the north which is well under way.
"This development is a key part the council's commitment, working with housing associations, to deliver 16,000 affordable and low cost homes and nearly £2bn investment over the next 10 years.
"This project is now part of a larger programme already delivering new affordable homes in Leith, Newhaven, Craigmillar, Pennywell, Gracemount and Chesser in one of the most ambitious council-led housebuilding programmes in the UK."
The plans have recently been criticised by Edinburgh MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton, who said the project had not taken into the account the impact on local infrastructure.
Mr Cole-Hamilton asked First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to intervene to protect public services and green belt land in the city.
