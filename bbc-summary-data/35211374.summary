Daniel Gordon, from the Elgin and Lossiemouth area, died on the B9089 Roseisle to Kinloss road at about 12:00 on New Year's Day.
Police Scotland said his family were "devastated by the loss".
The collision involved two Volkswagen Polos. The second vehicle caught fire but the occupants, including an 80-year-old woman, got out before emergency services arrived.
The pensioner, who was driving the car, was taken to hospital with serious but non-life threatening injuries.
Her 59-year-old male passenger was taken to hospital with minor injuries.
Sgt Steve Manson said: "We would appeal to anyone who saw either of the vehicles prior to the collision, or who was on the road at the time, to contact police on 101.
"We would particularly like to talk to a man who was walking nearby and gave assistance to the injured parties."
