[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town 0-0 Gillingham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gillingham preserved their League One status on the final day of the season with a goalless draw at Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Needing to match Port Vale's result at Fleetwood to assure survival, Gillingham started brightly and Josh Parker fired over, while the Cobblers went close when Brendan Moloney's shot was deflected wide.
Gillingham then wasted a glorious chance to settle the nerves in the ninth minute when David Buchanan impeded Cody McDonald in the box, but David Cornell saved Josh Wright's ensuing spot-kick.
Cornell also turned Jake Hessenthaler's low drive around the opposite upright before comfortably dealing with Lee Martin's curling effort.
The Cobblers offered little in attack until the closing stages of the first half. Shaun McWilliams saw his fierce drive deflected over, while Marc Richards somehow managed to guide his far post header wide and Zander Diamond headed over from a corner.
Gillingham upped the tempo after the restart and Cornell denied Ryan Jackson, Parker's shot was deflected wide and Mark Byrne was just off target.
However, Gillingham's initial threat petered out and they were left relying on Port Vale not getting the result they needed, before it was confirmed the Valiants had also only managed a draw.
