Search fails to find missing sea angler

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The search for a sea angler who went missing on the Aberdeenshire coast has been stood down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fraser Carrington, 32, from the Fife area, was night fishing at Tangleha, north of St Cyrus, when he disappeared from rocks in the early hours of Sunday in what were described as "exceedingly rough" conditions.
Another angler raised the alarm at about 03:00.
Search teams scoured the water and shoreline, but no trace was found.
A rescue helicopter, coastguard teams and the Montrose lifeboat were involved in the operation.
