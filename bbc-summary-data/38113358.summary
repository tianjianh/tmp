Chris Gunter headed into his own net early on before Martin's shot from outside the box made it 2-0.
Reading's Danny Williams was sent off soon after for kicking out at Stefan Johansen.
Sone Aluko fired in Fulham's third from inside the area, Johansen's sublime finish made it 4-0 and Martin scored a free-kick to complete the rout.
Fulham's victory gave them three consecutive wins against Reading at Craven Cottage for the first time and they completed the feat in style.
It took a bit of help from Gunter to get them under way as the Wales international headed Ryan Fredericks' cross past team-mate and keeper Ali Al-Habsi.
The visitors, whose majority shareholders are rumoured to be selling their stake to a Chinese brother and sister, kept the scoreline at 1-0 until four minutes after the break when Martin opened his account by firing in from 25 yards.
After Williams was sent off, the hosts made the most of their advantage with three more goals.
Aluko beat two defenders on his way into the box before curling in from a tight angle, Johansen expertly struck with the outside of his left boot from inside the area, and Martin smashed in a free-kick.
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"We scored five but we could have been more clinical at some moments. It is important when your moment arrives that you kill off the opponents.
"When I took Watford up they were more a little bit more clinical than we are right now.
"Normally I am never satisfied but today I am satisfied. I just want us to know that we can still do better than that."
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"We gave them too much space and time on the ball, we made wrong decisions on the ball and they finished us.
"It wasn't a red card. Danny Williams had the ball and wanted to pass or kick it off the pitch.
"He fell over and the Fulham player fell on top of him and I don't think Danny kicked him in the chest."
