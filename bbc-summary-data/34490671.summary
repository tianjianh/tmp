Jonathan Briers: Three-year sentence for Belfast car hijacking

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who hijacked a car from a "vulnerable" community worker in west Belfast has been given a three-year sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Briers, of Cherryhill Road in Dundonald, County Down, was so drunk on the day of the hijacking that he has no memory of his actions.
But the 33-year-old admitted four charges linked to the incident.
The judge at Belfast Crown Court told him the hijacking would have been "terrifying" for the woman he targeted.
Briers, who has 126 previous convictions, will serve 18 months of his sentence in prison, with the remaining period on licence when he is released.
The court heard that on 4 December last year, Briers' victim had closed a community centre in Glenbank in west Belfast and was getting into her car when he grabbed her and told her to hand over her car keys.
She gave him the keys to the community centre and ran from the scene to seek help from a shopkeeper.
The woman returned to her car with two men - a member of staff from the shop and a customer.
They found Briers in the driver's seat trying to start the car with the wrong key.
When he was confronted, he got out of the car, apologised and tried to walk away.
One of the men tried to restrain Briers, who lunged at him.
The other man "acted in self-defence" and punched Briers, who fell to the ground.
He refused to give a preliminary breath test when police officers arrived, and while in custody he smeared excrement in a police cell.
The court heard that Briers committed the hijacking less than a week after he was released from prison for serving a sentence for robbing a fast food shop on Belfast's Shankill Road.
His solicitor said that Briers was "completely appalled" by what he did to the woman and that he was "ashamed and embarrassed" by his behaviour in the police station afterwards.
He added that Briers wanted to offer a "full apology" to the woman and the men who came to her aid for the "unsavoury incident".
