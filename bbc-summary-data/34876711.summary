Lomu, 40, died on Wednesday.
Hart said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key's office had relayed a message from the Queen to Lomu's widow Nadene.

"She has written to the prime minister specifically asking for a message to be sent to Nadene and the family to say how much she mourns the loss as well," Hart said.
Hart, who coached New Zealand between 1996 and 1999, has been acting as a spokesman for the family of Lomu, who died at his home in Auckland.
The legendary wing, who won 63 All Blacks caps, became a global star after scoring four tries against England in the 1995 World Cup semi-final. He was diagnosed with a rare kidney condition that year.
Hart said that it was possible that a public memorial could be held at Auckland's 50,000-capacity Eden Park stadium, but added that the family were still in discussions with central and local government in New Zealand about what was "most appropriate".
"I am delighted with the tremendous support we are getting from government and local government to celebrate Jonah's life," Hart added.
"We have agreed that there will be a public memorial service and that will be followed by a private family church service."
