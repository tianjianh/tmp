Juventus have been fined 30,000 euros (£25,685) for their fans' racist abuse of AC Milan players on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Juve fans directed racist chants at Milan's black players and also displayed a racist banner during the Turin side's 1-0 victory.
Milan midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng was targeted for jeers and responded by putting his finger to his lips.
Juventus fans' group the Drughi had appealed for supporters not to engage in racist behaviour before the game.
Former Portsmouth and Tottenham midfielder Boateng has become a key figure in the anti-racism campaign in Italy after walking off the pitch during a friendly with lower league side Pro Patria following racist abuse in January.
A penalty from Juventus's Arturo Vidal was the only goal of the game.
