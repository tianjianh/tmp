Gritters have been blessed by clergy including the Bishop of Lincoln as part of preparations to make Lincolnshire's roads safer this winter.

It is the latest unusual blessing for the Right Reverend Christopher Lowson, who has also blessed church toilets.
"Gritters and toilets are really important parts of our lives," he told BBC Radio Lincolnshire.
All 43 of Lincolnshire's gritters were blessed by various clergy at the county's eight depots earlier.
The Right Reverend Lowson said: "Toilets is probably the strangest thing [I've blessed] but it's actually making the point that God is not just interested in what you might think of as holy stuff, but the whole of life."
Talking about the first time he blessed toilets, he said: "As we finished, the toilet flushed and this rather embarrassed man came out of it with the congregation standing with the bishop in the middle of them.
"So the toilet was blessed in several ways really."
Gritters are not the only vehicle to have been blessed.
Last year, the Bishop of Chelmsford blessed the Queen's Bentley when it failed to start following a Sandringham church service.
The car then burst into life and the Queen said: "Don't let it stop."
An air ambulance was blessed by Exeter Cathedral's Dean, and the Bishop of Plymouth blessed a new lifeboat.
In 2011, the Bishop of Wakefield blessed keen churchgoer Mandy the Yorkshire Terrier.
The vicar of St Anne in the Grove, Southowram, noted that Mandy "seems to know that a different code of behaviour is needed in church".
"One of the reasons we've never had a real live donkey for Palm Sunday services is a worry about what it may deposit on the floor but with Mandy, we've never had a problem," the vicar said.
