[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An immediate review is needed at all mental health wards run by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, an independent watchdog said.

In May, a report into the Tawel Fan ward at Bodelwyddan's Glan Clwyd Hospital found patients were kept "like animals".
A new allegation was made on BBC Wales' Week In Week Out over the death of a patient at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
The health board has investigated 47 other incidents at the Gwanwyn ward.
Of those incidents over the last 12 months, 27 are said to have involved patient-on-patient assaults and 20 were patient-on-staff assaults.
A spokesman for the health board said it had received six complaints relating to the Gwanwyn ward since October 2012.
He added a member of staff had been suspended while the board investigated an allegation of inappropriate physical restraint on a patient at the ward.
A second inquiry was also looking into an alleged incident where an employee was said to have not responded appropriately to a patient's threat to self-harm, he said.
Simon Dean, the health board's interim chief executive, said he became aware of the allegations raised in the BBC Wales programme "very recently".
He added: "They are very serious and we will take appropriate action.
"We have to be sure there is not a systemic problem, we are looking into this as best we can."
But Tony Rucinski, chief executive of the Board of Community Health Councils, which looks after the interest of patients, told BBC Wales he wanted to see a "root and branch" review all units.
"What we would ask for is a systemic solution, not something which looks good on paper in 100 days and is handed over to somebody else again to take on," he said.
"But a real root and branch systemic approach to sorting out the dignity and respect at the bedside winning the hearts and minds of the staff involved to make sure the patients get the care they deserve."
A spot check was carried out at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in June by the Welsh government.
The results of a separate inspection carried out Healthcare Inspectorate Wales (HIW) will be published soon.
The health board said the HIW inspection also found an allegation of abuse by a staff member was made some months ago but there was no evidence of any injury consistent with the claims that had been made.
