British number one Watson, 23, broke the serve of Russian Yulia Putintseva six times in a 6-2 6-4 victory.
The world number 59 will next play Serbia's Jelena Jankovic, ranked 25, in the first round on Monday.
Konta, 24, will face Germany's Andrea Petkovic after thrashing American Irina Falconi 6-2 6-1 in an hour.
"Yes it's definitely good times [for British tennis]," said Konta. "Heather played two really good matches and she came through really strongly and that's all positive things for her too going into the main draw."
