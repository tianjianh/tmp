The song will be heard for the first time on X Factor tonight.
The latest version of Do They Know It's Christmas was recorded yesterday by Chris Martin, One Direction, Ed Sheeran and a bunch of others.
The song will be made available to download at 08:00 GMT on Monday, priced 99p.
The man behind the project admits it will only be a rough edit for tonight's show. Bob Geldof who put together the fist song thirty years ago told Newsbeat:
"We'll have a rough edit on The X Factor and we'll have a rough edit of the film. Simon [Cowell], not many people know, but he always joins in on these things.
"He called me and said 'do you want five minutes on The X Factor?' Yes! So it may not be the finished single."
A CD version costing Â£4 will be released three weeks later with a cover designed by artist Tracey Emin.
The track will not be made available on Spotify and other music streaming services until January.
Everyone involved has been encouraging people not to download it for free.
Geldof told fans: "Come Monday at 08:00 when every station plays this track across the nation, buy this thing. Don't go looking for it free. Buy it."
The original version sold 3.7 million copies.
Five years later, another version was produced by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, largely featuring their artists such as Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Sonia.
In 2004, Band Aid 20 was recorded by the likes of Coldplay, Dizzee Rascal, Ms Dynamite, Will Young and Robbie Williams.
