The local authority approved a 3% council tax increase as part of its budget a fortnight ago.
Key investment areas include roads, bridges, schools, flood protection and economic development.
Leader David Parker is to take part in a Facebook and Twitter question and answer session on the plans between 18:00 and 19:00 on Thursday.
He said: "Earlier this month we agreed our revenue and capital plans for the next five and 10 years respectively.
"In addition to protecting frontline service, we have committed substantial funds to key infrastructure right across the Borders, regeneration of our towns and improvements in schools.
"These are being delivered despite decreasing public funding and increased demand for council services and I am interested to hear the views of Borderers on this budget, our priorities and about council services in general."
