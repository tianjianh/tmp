[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The ballot has opened in the contest to elect a new leader of the Green Party in England and Wales, with the result to be announced in early September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former leader and MP Caroline Lucas is standing on a job-share ticket with Jonathan Bartley.
Other candidates in the running include Simon Cross, Clive Lord, David Malone, Martie Warin and David Williams.
A new deputy leadership and executive are also being elected, with the outcome due at the autumn conference.
The contest will not include Natalie Bennett, who has decided to step down as leader after four years at the helm of the party.
Ms Bennett said in May that she would not be standing for re-election when her second two-year term in office expires in the summer, but that she would remain "fully engaged" in the party.
The ballot to elect her successor will be open for one month, until 25 August.
Elections are also taking place for half of the party's national executive committee as well as the deputy leadership.
All paid-up party members are eligible to vote in the contest, the results of which will be unveiled at the party's autumn conference in Birmingham between 2 and 4 September.
