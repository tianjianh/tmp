[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cheltenham Town 1-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
John Akinde's 17th goal of the season secured a win for Barnet at struggling Cheltenham Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barnet took the lead in the eighth minute when Luke Gambin crashed a left-footed effort against the bar and Curtis Weston was quickest to react, rolling a shot into the net from eight yards.
Cheltenham had a penalty appeal for handball turned down four minutes later when Jack Barthram's cross from the right was charged down.
Danny Wright hit the left post in the 37th minute with Jamie Stephens beaten and almost immediately Barnet broke and hit the post themselves through Akinde, who powered past Dan Parslow.
But Cheltenham levelled in the 44th minute when Wright reached Jack Munns' free-kick and headed into the top right corner for his sixth goal of the season.
Barnet regained the lead seven minutes into the second half when Akinde finished off a swift break, latching onto Gambin's pass.
Griffiths saved Alex Nicholls' free-kick low to his left and Akinde hit the post again with a header in the 68th minute.
