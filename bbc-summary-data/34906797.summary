Scores of migrants are spending another night stuck on the Greece-Macedonia border after they were not allowed to continue their journey.

Groups of people have been seen trying to warm up around bonfires on a cold night on the Greek side of the border.
About six migrants earlier sewed their lips together in protest.
Macedonia and other Balkan nations said last week they would only let in people fleeing conflicts - such as in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Hundreds of migrants have been protesting for several days against the decision.
About 2,900 people crossed into Macedonia in the 24 hours before 06:00 (local time) on Monday, down from more than 6,000 on the previous day, the Associated Press news agency quoted local police as saying.

Europe's border controls have come under renewed scrutiny since the attacks in Paris on 13 November.
At least two of the militants involved had passed through Greece, apparently posing as migrants, early last month.
Balkan countries said last week they would only open their borders to people fleeing countries affected by war such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
