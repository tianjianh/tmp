A blue plaque honouring Manchester United star Duncan Edwards will be unveiled by Sir Bobby Charlton rather than ex-England manager Sam Allardyce.

Allardyce was due to unveil the tribute in Dudley, West Midlands, on Saturday.
He resigned as England manager after The Daily Telegraph claimed he offered advice on how to "get around" transfer rules.
Dudley MP Ian Austin, who has helped organise the unveiling, said he was informed Allardyce would not be coming.
Duncan Edwards lived on the Priory estate in Dudley and signed for Manchester United as a teenager.
He was the youngest England player since the Second World War when he died of injuries sustained in the 1958 Munich Air Crash.
Mr Austin said he was "delighted" Sir Bobby - who survived the crash - was coming.
"Are you joking? He was Duncan Edward's best friend," he said.
Allardyce was filmed telling undercover reporters it was "not a problem" to bypass rules on third-party player ownership and claimed he knew of agents who were "doing it all the time".
Third-party ownership - when someone other than the buying and selling club owns a stake in a player, typically an investor - has been banned by the FA and world football's governing body Fifa.
The plaque commemorating Duncan Edwards has been designed by Dudley Borough Artist Steve Field.
