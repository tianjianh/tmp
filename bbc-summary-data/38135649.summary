In winning she also set a new Paralympic record and was joined on the podium with compatriots Jo Frith and Vicky Jenkins taking silver and bronze position to make it a clean sweep for Great Britain.
This year she's been balancing her sporting achievements alongside successfully taking her GCSE exams, studying for A levels and representing her school Boccia team in regional and national competitions
Here, Jess Stretton answers questions set by BBC News School Reporters from Aston Manor Academy in Birmingham.
If you weren't an athlete, what would you want to be and why?
I would be an English teacher because I love the subject and want to help others enjoy it as well.
English Literature is my favourite subject and allows me to need to read a book for study purposes and also gives me another excuse to be able to read when I'm on the shooting line!
Describe what a typical day of training is like for you
I get to the shooting range around 9am and shoot until 11am, doing 72 or 78 arrows in the morning.
I then have an hour study time and lunch before shooting again in the afternoon until I have done my arrow volume for the day, which is usually 120 arrows.
Then I go to the gym before going home.
What keeps you motivated to train?
The feeling I get when I shoot my bow is one of the best feelings in the world - it is only me, my bow and the target!
Also knowing the success that can bring.
What kind of support network do you think you need in the sports industry?
I think you need to have very flexible and understanding family and friends who are able to (particularly on bad days) remind you why you get up in the morning to train.
It does not matter if you have connections in the big companies at the start, that will come with time and with the places you go to.

Who is your biggest inspiration?
John Stubbs is my biggest inspiration because he is a multiple Paralympian and someone I aspire to be like.
Who do you think is a brilliant role model for aspiring athletes?
I think Jessica Ennis-Hill is a great role model because she is a brilliant athlete and a really good person to aspire to be like.
With the success she's had it is easy to look at her and think 'I want to be like her one day'.
What do you think is the biggest myth about being a successful sportsperson?
That you will win everything. This isn't true as anything could happen - you could get an injury, have an equipment failure, or just have a bad day at the time.
What advice would you give to other young people wanting to get into competitive sports?
Find a club or sports "have-a-go" day and just try it out!
Take every opportunity that comes your way until you find something you either really like or are good at and keep at it.
Do you have a certain ritual or routine you follow before a competition and if so what?
I usually just plug in my headphones and pick up my book to relax and just get away from the reality of what is happening.
This means I can focus more when the time comes to shoot in thinking it is just another shoot and that the outcome will only come after each separate arrow.
What is your 'golden moment' so far in your career?
I would have to say being on top of the podium in Rio at the 2016 Paralympics with the three GB flags in the air, signifying the clean sweep that my team mates and I achieved!
