Myles Bradbury, of Herringswell, Suffolk, admitted abusing 18 children in his care at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, between 2009 and 2013.
The 41-year-old arrived at Cambridge Crown Court at just after 08:00 GMT, six hours before the start of his two-day hearing.
He ignored questions from the BBC as he walked into court.
