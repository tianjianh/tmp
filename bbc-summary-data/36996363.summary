Andy Murray said his first thought as he led Team GB into the Maracana stadium at the opening ceremony of the Rio Olympics was "don't drop" the flag.

The British contingent got a rousing ovation from the crowd as a spectacle of sound and colour welcomed the 206 guest nations competing in the games.
Murray, defending Olympic champion and two-time Wimbledon winner, said: "It was amazing to get to carry the flag.
"I'm obviously really proud to get the opportunity."
The Scottish tennis star held the Union Jack aloft with his left arm - after appearing to struggle with the pole in practice.
He added: "My first thought was 'don't drop it' and I was gripping onto the flag really tight. Then I was just trying to take it all in. The size of the stadium was incredible."
Wearing red, white and blue, Team GB soaked up the electric atmosphere, with some team members taking selfies as they all waved to the crowds.
Chef de Mission, Mark England said the occasion was "everything we hoped it would be - vibrant, colourful and energetic" and would give the team a boost ahead of the competition.
On Day One at Rio there was Scottish interest in swimming, tennis, shooting and rowing.
Edinburgh's Jen McIntosh failed to qualify for the final of the women's 10m air rifle event but secured the best-ever finish for a British woman - 15th out of 51.
Elsewhere, Colin Fleming was involved in the tennis doubles.
In the rowing, Katherine Grainger and her partner Vicky Thornley finish second in their heat to reach the semi-finals in the doubles sculls.
Swimmer Hannah Miley narrowly missed out on a bronze medal in the 400m individual medley. She was in third place with the last 50m to go but she was edged out into fourth spot.
Ross Murdoch failed to make the final in the 100m breaststroke after finishing 6th in his semi-final.
