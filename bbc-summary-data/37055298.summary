The 33-year-old, a 3,000m steeplechase athlete, tested positive in a doping control conducted a few days after her arrival in Brazil on 26 July.
Her case has already gone before the Court of Arbitration for Sport's anti-doping panel in Rio, which declared her "ineligible to compete".
Athletics' governing body, the IAAF, will now decide her punishment.
Danekova told Bulgarian television: "I've been tested four times after entering the Olympic Village.
"The results of three of the samples were negative. It's an incredibly big shock.
"I don't feel guilty. I cannot tell you how humiliated I feel.
"I feel robbed emotionally. But we're coming from the East [eastern Europe], we're too close to Russia."
Danekova raced in the 3,000m steeplechase at the London Olympics in 2012 but did not get beyond the heats.
Hers is the third case to go before the Cas anti-doping panel - it has also banned Polish weightlifter Tomasz Zielinski from the Games, while China's teenage swimmer Chen Xinyi has accepted a provisional suspension while a positive drug test is investigated.
