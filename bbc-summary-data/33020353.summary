Two subway trains have collided in the Italian capital Rome, injuring at least 12 people, Italian reports say.

Most people suffered minor injuries but La Stampa said (in Italian) two people were trapped in the crash.
Rome's councillor for transport, Guido Improta, has reportedly blamed the incident on "human error".
The collision happened at the Palasport station in the Eur district, a business and residential district in the south of the Italian capital.
"There are 12 people injured but none are emergency patients," Mr Improta said, according to the Ansa news agency.
"Now the dynamics of what happened have to be worked out. It's certainly bizarre. There was certainly a human error."
A woman was killed and more than 100 people injured in a collision between two subway trains in 2006 at the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II station in Rome.
