George Fessey, of Swadlincote, Derbyshire, intervened in a scuffle outside the After Dark nightclub, in Clumber Street, on 29 December 2012.
He lifted a 20-year-old man above his head and threw him to the ground.
The man was left in a coma after the attack and continues to receive treatment for his injuries.
The 25-year-old, who had previously pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm, was jailed for two years at Nottingham Crown Court.
Det Insp Phil Sims, of Mansfield CID, said: "This was a classic case of adrenaline-fuelled violence and bravado, leading to a massive over-reaction and use of unnecessary force by one man against another who was half his size.
"It's never a fair fight between someone who can lift a person above his head and body-slam him to the ground."
He added: "George Fessey left his victim in the absolute lowest level of consciousness before death, he's fortunate to have come out of it as well as he has.
"Not only was it a traumatic, life-altering ordeal for the victim, there were also a number of people who witnessed this, frankly stomach churning, incident.
"It's fair to say it brought an abrupt end to their festive celebrations."
