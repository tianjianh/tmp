The 31-year-old finished with a score of 639.30, 60 points more than Mexico's Jonathan Paredes, with fellow Briton Blake Aldridge fifth.
Hunt, from Southampton, was second at the inaugural World Cup in 2014 but failed to make the podium last year.
However, he beat Paredes to claim victory at the World Championships in Kazan, Russia, in August.
