She told BBC TV's Ask the Leader election special it had been a "terrible mistake" for the Lib Dems to make "a promise which we could not keep" while part of the coalition government at Westminster.
The Welsh Lib Dems want to replace tuition fee subsidies of up to Â£5,190 a year with maintenance grants of Â£2,500.
Ms Williams said she wanted to be "upfront" about what she thought was affordable.
