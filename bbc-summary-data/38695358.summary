Cardiff's Global Foods £120k fine for 'high-risk' produce

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cardiff food wholesaler has been fined £120,000 for delivering "high-risk" goods in unrefrigerated vehicles.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Global Foods Ltd was issued with a legal notice in September 2014 after a complaint about cheese and ham being delivered in unsuitable vehicles.
On 9 December 2015, a check on a van delivering to a takeaway showed meat was not refrigerated again.
Director Mubarak Ali, appearing for the company, was hit with the fine at Cardiff Magistrates' Court on Thursday.
Global Foods Ltd, which has a food hygiene rating of 1, said the wrong delivery truck had been loaded in error by a driver.
