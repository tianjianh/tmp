Peel won 76 Wales caps between 2001 and 2011 and represented the British and Irish Lions in three Tests.
The 34-year-old made 20 appearances for Bristol after joining in 2014 and will now join the club's coaching staff.
"Following the medical advice, I really had no further choice," he told the club website.
"I've been fortunate enough to enjoy some incredible experiences during my playing career and have met some fantastic people.
"I'm grateful to Bristol Rugby for their support and will continue to work hard alongside the coaching team to ensure the season ends on a high."
Peel started his career at Llanelli, which become Scarlets following the advent of regional rugby in 2003.
He made his Wales debut against Japan in 2001 and became the youngest Welsh player to win 50 caps in 2007 - until George North claimed that accolade last year.
Peel played a prominent role in Wales' Six Nations Grand Slam in 2005, while he also featured as Wales repeated the feat three years later.
But following his move to Sale - also in 2008 - Peel gradually fell out of favour under Wales head coach Warren Gatland.
He eventually lost his national starting place to former Llanelli team-mate Mike Phillips, and Peel won the last of his 76 Wales caps against France in 2011.
He joined Bristol in 2014 and captained the team that lost last year's Championship play-off final to Worcester.
