Dundee United 2-2 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United and Falkirk shared four brilliant goals in an enthralling Premiership play-off semi-final first leg at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Murray drove his 17th goal of the season to put United ahead.
The Bairns regained their composure and Joe McKee crossed for James Craigen to perfectly time a scissor-kick finish.
Blair Spittal restored the Tangerines' lead but Falkirk equalised again when McKee found the top corner with a wonderful 30-yard free-kick.
The sides will meet again at the Falkirk Stadium on Friday and the eventual winner will face Hamilton Academical or Inverness Caledonian Thistle - whichever side finishes second bottom in the top flight - in the final.
Both sides experienced spells of dominance, with Falkirk edging it before the break.
Bairns boss Peter Houston - who led United to Scottish Cup glory almost seven years ago to the day - did have to watch his former employers take the lead, though.
Tangerines forward Thomas Mikkelsen got the better of Luca Gasparotto to flick on Cammy Bell's long kick and Murray raced on to the ball and rifled it confidently across goal into the far left corner.
The Dundee-born striker has been prolific for his home city club in these play-offs - that being his third goal in as many games after netting in both legs of the quarter-final against Greenock Morton.
But the visitors responded. Craigen was primed and ready to make the most of McKee's delicious delivery, connecting acrobatically to send the ball into Bell's net.
Craigen, Lee Miller and Nathan Austin all went close for the Bairns before half-time, yet it was the home side who nudged themselves in front again at the start of the second period.
Like Murray, who turned creator, Spittal netted to make it three goals for him in the three play-off matches. The former Queen's Park midfielder produced an accurate, if unexpected, low finish into the far corner from the right edge of the box.
The game would swing again, however, and it was another strike of tremendous quality for both the Falkirk fans and Houston on the touchline to enjoy.
Most thought McKee would send his set piece from wide on the left into the box, but the former Morton man hammered the ball into the top left corner past a despairing Bell.
Miller's replacement John Baird thought he had added a third for the Bairns with a really nicely directed header from Craigen's cross, but referee Bobby Madden disallowed after the flag was raised by his assistant.
And, in stoppage time, Bairns goalkeeper Robbie Thomson clawed away Mikkelsen's looping header to ensure it ended all square.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "I enjoyed the game. It was an interesting game.
"They've come out and given everything, they've taken the lead twice, there's a desire to win the game so I'm very pleased and the game's still sitting in the balance going into Friday.
"We can certainly go down there and win and we'll go down there with a really positive mentality and we can't wait for the game.
"We'd obviously have liked to have taken a win down there, an advantage. I'm sure it'll be an open game."
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "It was a terrific game. Both teams had a go. We showed great character. We changed our system and the system worked for us.
"I thought for 10 minutes of the first half, we lost it but I think the rest of the game, we more or less dominated.
"We look forward to Friday night. We know it's going to be a difficult game - winner take all - but we're more than confident that we can make the final of the play-off again.
"What we have to cut out is silly goals."
