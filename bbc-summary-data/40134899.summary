Mexican midfielder Carlos Pena has arrived in Glasgow ahead of his proposed move to Rangers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old is likely to become Pedro Caixinha's third summer signing, joining the Ibrox club from Chivas Guadalajara.
Pena has 19 caps for Mexico and spent last season on loan at Leon, also in the Mexican top flight.
Rangers have signed Portugal defender Bruno Silva and former Aberdeen captain Ryan Jack in the past week.
Pena can play as a holding midfielder or in a more attacking role.
