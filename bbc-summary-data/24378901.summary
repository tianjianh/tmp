O'Neill's current deal expires after the final World Cup qualifier against Israel later this month, in what has been a disappointing campaign.
The former Northern Ireland player has won just one of his 12 games in charge.
"I've had discussions with the IFA board and they have been positive - I've said all along that I would like to continue in the role," said O'Neill.
"I think there has been a major transition in the squad, it's a very young squad with not much experience.
"They will be better for the experience of taking part in the qualifying campaign and I'll certainly be better for the experience of managing during it.
"I would like to get the opportunity to take this squad forward to the European Championship qualifiers."
IFA president Jim Shaw gave his backing to O'Neill following last month's humiliating 3-2 defeat by Luxembourg.
"I still see him as the man to take us forward to the European Championships," said Shaw in the wake of the shock result.
Following the squad announcement on Thursday for the Azerbaijan and Israel games, Shaw confirmed that talks with O'Neill had started but there was "no substantive input" so far.
