[SN]TITLE[SN]
T in the Park £50,000 Scottish government grant repaid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
T in the Park organisers have paid back £50,000 of a Scottish government grant awarded to help the festival relocate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
DF Concerts repaid the money after confirming in November that the Strathallan Castle event would not take place this year.
It was given a £150,000 grant after the festival was forced to move from Balado in Kinross in 2015.
DF Concerts announced a three-day festival to be held in Glasgow in July in place of T in the Park.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "In line with the grant conditions, DF Concerts have now repaid the Scottish government £50,000 following its decision to not stage the 2017 event."
