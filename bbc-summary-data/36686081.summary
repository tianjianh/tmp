River Wye salmon catch hits 20-year high

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglers fishing on the River Wye have recorded more than 500 spring catches - as salmon return in numbers not seen 20 years, conservationists have said.

The Wye and Usk Foundation said projects to restore habitats on the river and combat pollution were behind the recovery.
Work has included building fish passes and schemes to tackle acid rain.
The foundation said the river "bucks the trend" seen in others in England and Wales.
The announcement on catches came as the founder of the conservation group, Dr Stephen Marsh-Smith, stepped down as its executive director.
