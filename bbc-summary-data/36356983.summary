Guernsey income tax office early closures to end

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Temporary closures of Guernsey's Income Tax Office have ended after nearly four years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Every Thursday since September 2012 the office has closed early to visitors and entirely to phone calls in a bid to catch up with a backlog in returns.
Tim Loveridge, director of Income Tax transformation, said reopening is one of the ways the office is trying to improve its engagement with the public.
He said "legacy issues" that caused the backlog were being worked on.
He described improvements as a "work in progress", adding that modernisation would take some time.
Mr Loveridge said: "We're trying to be much more joined up now, rather than just an isolated income tax department or office. We are very much part of the whole States of Guernsey and how we might share resources to be more effective."
From next month the office's counters and phone lines will be open from 09:00-16:00 Monday to Friday.
