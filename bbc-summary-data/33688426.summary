Platini is the overwhelming favourite to replace him.
As well as the backing of his own European confederation, he is understood to have gained support from:

In club football, the Champions League has grown in popularity, with British broadcaster BT Sport agreeing to pay Â£900m for exclusive live rights to European football's top club competition from 2015-16.
However, Platini has faced criticism, largely over his support for Qatar's staging of the Fifa World Cup in 2022.
