As Labour meet for its annual conference in Brighton, the Shadow Scottish Secretary spoke to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme.
He said: "My position on Trident has not changed - I will not support the renewal of Trident.
"My party leadership has changed, my party is changing, the Scottish party is changing - my view on Trident has not changed. I will not vote to support it.
"I have had the view for a long time, Jeremy [Corbyn] holds that view.
"If we all supported the same position it would make democracy a much less important part of British life. We should welcome the debate."
During the interview, the MP for Edinburgh South defended comments by Mr Corbyn - the party's UK leader - who said the SNP administration in Holyrood had  "privatised CalMac", and was also "behind the privatisation of ScotRail".
Mr Murray said Mr Corbyn was raising a good point about "how we do things" and that "key pubic services should stay in public hands".
