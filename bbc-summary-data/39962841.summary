[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called out to search for Jerzy Florkowski, from Lancashire, at about 20:30 on Tuesday.
He had been reported as "overdue" having left Burnmouth earlier in the day.
He was found in the water close to the town and brought to the shore but died a short time later after attempts to revive him had failed.
Insp John Scott said: "This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts are with Jerzy's family as they come to terms with their loss."
