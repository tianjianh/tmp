Kent skittled Gloucestershire for just 61 in a huge 334-run win in their first County Championship match of 2017.

Darren Stevens did the damage for the hosts at Canterbury, taking 6-22, as Gloucestershire posted one of their lowest-ever first-class scores.
Set a target of 396, the visitors slumped to 37-9, before Liam Norwell's 24 saved them from total humiliation.
Earlier Kent moved their overnight 118-4 to 246 all out with Gloucestershire seamer Norwell taking 5-59.
In their second innings, only Jack Taylor and Norwell reached double figures for Gloucestershire, with Norwell and Chris Liddle's last-wicket stand of 24 the highest of the innings.
All-rounder Stevens, who turns 41 later this month, just missed out on bettering his best bowling figures of 7-21, but Gloucestershire's batsmen had no answer to his full medium-pacers.
Gloucestershire's lowest total in the County Championship was in 1920, when they were dismissed for 22 by Somerset in Bristol.
