The Welsh government put forward a two-year offer which includes a 1% pay rise from next April.
The deal, agreed at a meeting of unions, NHS managers and Welsh government officials in Wrexham on Thursday, covers 77,000 NHS staff excluding doctors and dentists.
Unison welcomed "the improvement on the previous offer" and "achieving the living wage for our lowest members".
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said the deal was a "credit to all parties" involved in the negotiations.
