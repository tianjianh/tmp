Cardiff City will seek a personal hearing for defender Sol Bamba after he was charged with threatening behaviour by the Football Association.

The charges follow an incident in Cardiff's 1-1 draw at Ipswich when the Ivory Coast international was sent-off.
"We're going to ask for a personal hearing I think that'll be done today," said manager Neil Warnock.
The 31-year-old has already received a two-game ban for his red card but could face more matches on the sidelines.
Bamba confronted the referee, fourth official and Neil Warnock as he reacted angrily to a Jonathan Douglas tackle.
The player and the club have until 18:00 GMT on Friday to respond to the charge.
Warnock accepts that the player's action were unacceptable, but feels there are areas of the FA report which the club could contest
"We spoke to Sol yesterday [Thursday] and we looked at all the videos that the league have sent us and whilst we agree his conduct wasn't right we do have certain discrepancies in the report we find so we will be looking at a personal hearing for that," he said.
Warnock confirmed Cardiff would look at taking internal disciplinary action against Bamba "as and when" but would not confirm a timetable.
