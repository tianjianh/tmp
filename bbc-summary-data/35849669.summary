[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Raith Rovers all but confirmed a place in the play-offs with victory over nearest challengers Greenock Morton.

James Craigen's solitary strike early in the second half  - his seventh goal of the season - clinched victory for the Kirkcaldy club at Cappielow.
Stefan McCluskey had an effort saved as Morton chased a leveller.
Fourth-placed Raith are now 13 points clear of the Greenock side, who sit fifth with five games left of the Scottish Championship season.
The result also means Rovers have beaten Morton in all four meetings this term.
The visitors' early ploy of utilising the long throw capabilities of Rory McKeown caused a few problems for the Morton defence.
In an early instance, Mark Stewart stretched to connect with an Iain Davidson head-flick but the striker's effort flew over.
Ross Callachan then controlled another McKeown delivery on his chest before sending in a volley that Derek Gaston saved comfortably.
Throwing seemed to be a theme for Rovers as their defenders threw themselves in front of shots while Morton finished the first half the stronger side.
Bobby Barr, who has signed a pre-contract with Rovers for next season, was first to have an effort blocked.
McCluskey was then foiled by Kyle Benedictus, while a few moments later the same Rovers defender looked to have turned a Michael Miller cross into his own net.
However, he was bailed out by the quick reflexes of his goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert, who managed to react and turn the ball wide.
Early in the second half Raith Rovers took the lead after a neat through pass from Callachan split the Morton defence.
Craigen pounced from close range as Gaston advanced from his goal line, the ball going through the keeper's legs.
Morton looked for a quick reply and Declan McManus had a shot deflected over before McCluskey saw his 20-yard strike tipped over by Cuthbert.
The home side then claimed a McManus shot had been blocked by the arm of Craig Barr inside the box but the penalty appeal was turned down.
And Raith held out for a valuable win that extends their unbeaten run to six games.
