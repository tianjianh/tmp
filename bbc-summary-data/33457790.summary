The MK I Supermarine Spitfire N3200 crashed during the evacuation of Dunkirk on 26 May 1940.
It was bought by an American collector after being discovered in the 1980s and was donated to Duxford museum near Cambridge after experts restored it.
A second unearthed Spitfire P9374 could fetch Â£2.5m at auction later.
It was owned by the same collector and is being sold at Christie's Exceptional Sale in London.
It was also restored at the Cambridgeshire museum and proceeds from the sale are going to the RAF Benevolent Fund and Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit.
The pair are the only MK I Spitfires in the world to have been restored to original specification and can fly.
During the visit to the former home of RAF Duxford, the duke watched an air display by the MK I fighter, sat in its cockpit and visited the site's Battle of Britain exhibition - contained in the hangar where No. 19 Squadron's Spitfires were housed during the war.
The visit marks the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, which began on 10 July 1940 and lasted until October while Britain saw off the threat of the German airforce.
The N3200, which originally flew out of RAF Duxford, shot down a Junkers JU 87 Stuka dive bomber before crash landing on Sangatte beach on 26 May 1940.
The P9374, flown by No. 92 Squadron at RAF Croydon, was shot down two days earlier at Calais, but both were never found until strong tides exposed them on the beaches during the 1980s.
They were bought by American entrepreneur and philanthropist Thomas Kaplan and after findings parts on sites including eBay, both were restored at Duxford over a number of years.
