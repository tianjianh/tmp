What's In Store? at Salford Museum and Art Gallery also features works by Bridget Riley, Patrick Caulfield and Lowry's mentor Adolphe Valette.
The university said art by rising stars including Rachel Maclean, Cao Fei and Mishka Henner would also be on show.
It is the first time its full art collection has gone on public display.
The exhibition includes The Narcia Fitting Out At The Tyne (1968) by Lowry, who was born in Stretford.
Lindsay Taylor, University of Salford art curator, said: "It is a celebration of the rich artistic history which exists here in Salford, and of the thriving North West contemporary arts scene, which the university... plays an intrinsic role in."
Born in November 1887, Laurence Stephen Lowry lived and worked around Manchester and Salford.
After being rejected by the Manchester Municipal College of Art in 1903, he continued to take private art classes.
In 1953 he was appointed an official artist at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.
In 1968 he rejected a knighthood proposed by the prime minister in the New Year's Honours list.
Lowry died on 23 February 1976, seven months before the opening of a major retrospective of his work at the Royal Academy.
