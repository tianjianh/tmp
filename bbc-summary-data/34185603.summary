The blaze at Finsbury Chase in the Monkston Park area of the town began just after 08:00 BST.
The roof of the terraced house has partially collapsed and adjacent homes have been damaged.
A spokesperson for South Central Ambulance Service said the children - a baby girl and a boy - did not have life threatening injuries.
Neighbour Gerald Ekosso told the BBC a Nigerian family lived in the house.
"Roof tiles were popping off and there was intense thick white smoke coming out of the roof," he said.
"I ran to the apartment house to make sure there was nobody in it. My downstairs neighbour and I were told by the growing crowd of people that the family had left."
The narrow cul-de-sac has been closed off to the public while crews ensure the fire is completely extinguished.
The cause is not yet known.
