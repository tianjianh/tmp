Southampton's Jack Stephens, 22, and Bournemouth's Baily Cargill, 20, have signed until the end of the season.
Coventry have also extended 34-year-old ex-Republic of Ireland international winger Stephen Hunt's short-term deal until the end of the season.
And they will still have use of teenage midfielder James Maddison, on loan, after selling him to Norwich City.
"I've made no secret of my desire to bolster our defensive options," said City boss Tony Mowbray, whose Sky Blues side have slipped to fifth in League One after picking up just one point out of a possible 12 from their last four games.
Stephens will undertake his second loan of the season after spending the first half of the campaign on loan at City boss Mowbray's old club, Championship side Middlesbrough.
The former England Under-21 international made his league debut as a 16-year-old with home-town club Plymouth Argyle before signing for Southampton for Â£150,000 in April 2011.
He spent last season on loan at Swindon Town, helping them to reach the League One play-offs, playing alongside City skipper Sam Ricketts.
Left-sided Cargill began his youth career at Leicester City, then Southampton before signing his first professional contract with Bournemouth in 2012.
All his 10 appearances for the Cherries have come in cup games, but he did make his Football League debut with Torquay United two seasons ago, following a three-month loan in the non-league top flight with Welling United.
