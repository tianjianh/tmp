The home side fought back from 3-0 down with 16 minutes remaining, only for former Shrewsbury midfielder Jon Taylor to then score an injury-time winner.
Taylor had earlier headed Posh in front before Lee Angol added a brace.
Jean-Louis Akpa-Akpro scored one and set up Andy Mangan and Jack Grimmer to make it 3-3, before Taylor won it prior to Ian Black's late sending off.
Town had to play the last five of the 10 minutes' added time with 10 men after Black was shown a second yellow card for a bad foul.
They then had to wait a further half hour before confirmation of the result in the delayed game at Gresty Road, where Doncaster Rovers lost to bottom club Crewe.
Coupled with Blackpool's 4-0 defeat by Wigan Athletic, which sealed the Latics' promotion, that was enough to ensure Shrewsbury's place in the third tier of English football for a second straight season.
Peterborough's win came a week after Graham Westley was sacked as manager, his assistant Grant McCann guiding them to victory in his first game as caretaker boss.
Shrewsbury Town manager Micky Mellon told BBC Radio Shropshire:
"I've never been involved in an experience like that in football. To survive you'd probably say 'job done'. But there are a lot of things going on in my head that I need to work through.
"My job when I first came here when I sat down with the chairman was to get promoted and then keep us up in League One. I've done that. But we have to learn from this.
"We knew it was going to be a tough season, when you lose key players and can't replace them. The important thing is that Shrewsbury learn their lesson and have League One players.
"We looked like we were towing a caravan at times. But that's what pressure can do. It can do strange things to people. It can fuel them on or it can go the other way."
