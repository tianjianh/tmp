The ex-Newcastle loanee was booked before scoring one of the goals in a 2-1 win over CSKA Moscow that took the Dutch league leaders into the knockout stage for the first time since 2007.
However, key midfielder Andres Guardado is set to return for PSV.
Atletico will have midfielder Augusto Fernandez back after a knee injury.
The Spaniards, beaten finalists in 2014, have not won in four knockout games against Dutch opposition in the Champions League.
Diego Simeone's side has also struggled for goals this season, with their total of 35 the lowest in the top seven of La Liga.
Antoine Griezmann is their top scorer with 19 goals and midfielder Koke is backing the France international to end a quiet spell of just one goal in his last seven appearances.
Koke said: "We have to be more aggressive in attack and when we achieve that we'll attain our objective.
"Griezmann is a truly great player and his goals will come. They will come when you least expect them."
PSV have won their last eight matches and are unbeaten in 18 games but have had trouble scoring penalties.
They had missed eight out of their last 12 attempts before Gaston Pereiro scored from the spot in a 2-0 win against Heracles Almelo last Saturday and the midfielder is set keep the job.
Coach Phillip Cocu said: "Gaston immediately said he felt good and wanted to take it. If he takes it like that, then he can take the next one, too."
