Wayne Stirrups from Canterbury in Kent told his family he was going to Cardiff to visit his sons, but has not been seen since 17 November.
Family and friends of the 30-year-old travelled to Cardiff on Sunday to raise awareness of his disappearance.
Mr Stirrups' brother Jason said: "We're all lost without him, we know he's in a bad place right now."
He said they have put up more than 1,200 posters in Cardiff, Bristol and London over the weekend.
Mr Stirrups said: "He's not only my brother, he's my best friend.
"He's there for not only me but pretty much anyone who needed him at a drop of a hat.
"He's a complete joker and is always making people laugh and smile."
He added: "I can't begin to explain what a great dad he is to his boys, to the extent he gave up his life in Kent to go be a stay at home dad in Bristol.
Mr Stirrups said their family needed him to contact them "to let us know he's safe".
Mike Beavis is a close friend of Wayne Stirrups.
He said a group of about 25 people travelled to Cardiff after there had been reported sightings of Mr Stirrups in the city centre.
They went to a pub to watch CCTV footage and to the police station.
As well as hanging posters, leaflets were handed out to the public encouraging them to use social media to help find their friend using hashtags #letsfindwayne and #whereswayne.
"He is a happy, bubbly guy who makes friends wherever he goes," said Mr Beavis.
"What's going on now is extremely out of character."
