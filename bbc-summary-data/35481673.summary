Oscar-tipped film The Revenant has held on to the top spot in the UK box office chart for a third week.

The film, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a frontiersman fighting for survival after being attacked by a bear, took £2.28m.
The Revenant's total after 17 days on UK release is now £16.09m.
Hot on its heels was the Robert De Niro comedy Dirty Grandpa, which came in at number two with £2.05m, despite having received a critical mauling.
De Niro's film, which also stars Zac Efron, also made £605,000 in previews.
It sees the Raging Bull star playing a grandfather who convinces his snobbish grandson to take him to Florida in order to fulfil a romantic ambition.
A review on Variety saying Dirty Grandpa was "a brutally unfunny stab at ribald comedy" was fairly typical of the critics' opinion.
But a trailer campaign that included a near-naked, drug smoking, bronzed Efron seemed to do the trick with the audience.
Star Wars: The Force Awakens continued its strong performance at number three in the chart after seven weeks.
The film made a further £1.3m, bringing its total UK takings to £119.4m so far. The film is now the UK's most successful film to date.
At number four was action comedy Ride Along 2, starring Ice Cube, making £1.3m in its second week.
Meanwhile, Spotlight - which is in the running for six Academy Awards - made a seemingly disappointing arrival in the UK, coming into the chart at number five.
Telling the true story of the Boston Globe's investigation into widespread child abuse within the Catholic Church in 2002, it took £1.06m.
Despite a weak box office, Spotlight was released in only 241 cinemas. Distributor eOne kept its opening week on a tight rein but will expand its roll-out this Friday to around 370 cinemas.
The Big Short, also up for five Oscars, performed respectfully in the sixth slot on the chart. The satire, starring Steve Carrell, Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling about the global financial crisis, made £959,765 in its second week.
Daddy's Home, starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, was in eighth place in its sixth week having made £601,301.  Rocky Spin-Off Creed was in ninth place in its third week, making a further £581,943.
Meanwhile two new releases filled out the top 10: Capture the Flag came in at seven while a live performance of Turandot by the Metropolitan Opera in New York entered at number 10.
