Exeter City forward Reuben Reid says he was elated to score his 100th career goal.

The 28-year-old reached the landmark in Exeter's 3-0 win at Grimsby Town in League Two on 14 January.
"It was a proud moment," Reid, who has played for 13 clubs during a near 11-year career, told BBC Sport.
"I've had managers and people tell me that I wouldn't play 100 games, so to get 100 goals is quite an achievement, especially for the position I play."
Reid has scored five times for Exeter since joining the Grecians in September.
He was one of League Two's most prolific marksmen between 2013 and 2015 while at Plymouth Argyle, but injury last season saw him score just seven goals.
"I wasn't really thinking about getting to the landmark at all really," added Reid, who had to wait almost two months before getting his 100th goal.
"I knew I was on 99 but I wasn't chasing it, it wasn't in my brain."
Reid has formed part of an impressive attacking unit at Exeter, with David Wheeler, Ollie Watkins and himself combining to score 12 goals in Exeter's past six games.
That form has helped Exeter from just above the relegation places to 10th position, four points below the play-offs.
"At the moment the goals seem to be going in for the lads and hopefully it continues," Reid said.
"A lot that you see on the pitch is training ground-based. It's very nice when it comes off and we're seeing the rewards from that.
"As long as we win and keep winning points, I'd take not scoring again."
