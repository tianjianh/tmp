The contents of a child's bedroom have been dumped in a river, sparking an Environment Agency appeal for information to track down the culprits.

The waste consisting of flat-pack bedroom furniture, toys and clothes was retrieved by officers from the water at Compton Dundon, Somerset on Tuesday.
A spokesman said it took four staff two hours to pull out the dumped items, at a cost to the taxpayer of Â£200.
The furniture was taken to a depot to be recycled.
In a tweet, the Environment Agency wrote: "To the person who seems to have lost a full children's bedroom set in Compton Dundon - we have fished it out.
"But where should we return it?"
A spokesman added that throwing rubbish into any watercourse creates a blockage with the risk of further pollution problems.
He added: "It will grow and create further problems and could block Walton sluice in Eighteen Foot Rhyne, posing a flood risk to land upstream."
