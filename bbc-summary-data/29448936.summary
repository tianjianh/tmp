The American musician said he decided to "create" the jobs after hearing about the number of unemployed people in the UK.
Roles included playing instruments on the track, being part of the promotional team and directing the music video.
He's teamed up with Rudimental and GoThinkBig - a company which offers paid work experience placements.
Nile Rodgers and Rudimental were talking to Newsbeat's Nesta McGregor.
