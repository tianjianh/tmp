BBC Body Talk: A conversation about body image & sport in Women's Sport Week

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In honour of  Women's Sport Week, BBC Get Inspired and Radio 1Xtra present Body Talk, an intimate and interactive discussion on body image issues for women in and around sport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Radio 1's Adele Roberts will be chatting with a collection of open and honest women from the sport and entertainment worlds.
Paralympian Hannah Cockroft, So Solid Crew's Lisa Maffia, Olympic cyclist Joanna Rowsell Shand, boxer Natasha Jonas, Lady Xsize, TV psychologist Emma Kenny and Liverpool's own heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson are just some of the people we'll hear from.
The group will be talking at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) in Liverpool on Thursday, 6 October at 14:00 BST.
Tickets for the show have all been allocated but, for anyone not lucky enough to be in Liverpool, you can watch it live on the BBC Sport and BBC Radio 1Xtra websites.
This live interactive session will cover everything from physical and medical conditions to religious and cultural diversity.
Whether it's size, shape, periods, body hair or anything else, there are a lot of body image barriers that prevent us from taking part in physical activity.
By talking about them and not hiding behind them, we can improve our experience and learn from each other.
We're taking the time to talk about our body issues because you are not alone. Every woman has them, even medal-winning athletes!
Use #BBCBodyTalk on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram  to join the conversation or put your own question to the panel. You can also email us.
Set a reminder. Don't miss it.
