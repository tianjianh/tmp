It broke out at a business on East Cannock Road, Hednesford, shortly before 19:00 BST on Thursday.
Staffordshire Fire and Rescue said it involved about 100 tonnes of metal, including scrapped cars.
Local residents were warned to keep doors and windows shut. Roads in the area were closed but have since reopened.
Some businesses in the area were evacuated and at its height the smoke could be seen several miles away.
The fire was brought under control on Thursday evening and crews have spent the night damping down.
