The Welshman was part of BBC Sport's coverage from Wimbledon along with the corporation's ex-presenter Des Lynam.
"Gerry was one of the finest tennis commentators of our time," said Barbara Slater, director of BBC Sport.
"His famous Wimbledon commentary and his on-screen partnership with Des Lynam will be remembered with fondness by everyone at BBC Sport."
She added: "He was a man of great talent and will be sadly missed."
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller described Williams as "one of the great BBC tennis voices and personalities".
BBC Sport presenter Sue Barker said: "I always admired his style and humour and was thrilled when he asked me to be his co-commentator many times.
"He was always so helpful and encouraging and I knew I was learning from the very best."
She added: "We remained close friends on and off air - dinners with Gerry were always full of laughter and his love of tennis was infectious.
"He was a wonderful commentator and broadcaster, but above all a great friend."
