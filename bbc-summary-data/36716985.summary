Chase signed for Tigers until the end of the season on Saturday, having left Championship side Leigh in May.
The 30-year-old played for Tigers between 2009 and 2013, before leaving to join Salford Red Devils.
"I'm not match fit because I've had some time off, but mentally I'm in the best shape I've ever been," he said.
"Physically I've got a bit of work to do but you can get through anything if you're mentally right. There's some hard work to do, I'm aware of that, but I'm looking forward to it."
Chase also praised the Rugby Football League (RFL) for the support they offer players who are struggling with mental health-related issues.
"It's massive and it's a credit to the RFL that they touch on it because a lot of the boys struggle with it," Chase said.
"People should be aware of it because a lot of us boys have to go through a lot of things and we put on this bravado that we're OK. It's not something that people like talking openly about because you feel weak and vulnerable.
"But really we go home and we feel alone. It's good to get the message out there that it does happen in our game, a lot of people do suffer from depression.
"When you are in that dark place, you feel weak and vulnerable, you just have a lot of down days and it's not nice. But when you come through it, it's an unbelievable feeling. You feel strong."
