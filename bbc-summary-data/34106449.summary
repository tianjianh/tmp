Some 100 firefighters were called out to the building in Bellegrove Road, Welling, where the first floor collapsed.
The fire spread throughout the building and the roof caught alight, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. Crews were called at 09:25 BST and the fire was under control four hours later.
Firefighters remain at the scene dampening down.
Bellegrove Road should be be fully reopened by 19:00, said the Met Police.
Seven people left the building before the brigade arrived and there were no reports of any injuries.
Martin Freeman, from the London Fire Brigade, said: "Staff at the pub had a lucky escape as they heard the smoke alarm sound, left the pub and alerted the brigade."
He said had the firefighters not had an early warning "there could have been a very different outcome".
