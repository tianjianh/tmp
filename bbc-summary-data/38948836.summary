[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lewis Ball, 26, has not been seen since he left the Thekla on Bristol's Floating Harbour at 03:20 GMT last Sunday.
Police have now traced three people who left the nightclub at the same time as Lewis.
Avon and Somerset Police said they may have "information which could be vital to our search".
Det Insp Adam Stacey said: "Our efforts to find Lewis continue unabated and while we now have new lines of enquiry to progress we're still keen to talk to anyone who has information who has not yet contacted us.
"If you have any information, no matter how insignificant you think it might be, please call us as it could prove to be vital."
Drivers have also been asked to check their dashcam footage if they were in the area at the time.
Lewis is described as white, 5ft 9ins tall and of slim build. When he went missing he was wearing a black jumper, black skinny jeans and brown ankle boots.
