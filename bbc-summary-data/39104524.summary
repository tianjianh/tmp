Melinda Korosi death: Partner denies her murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman was murdered by her partner just two days after he was released from prison for a previous assault on her, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Melinda Korosi, 33, suffered head and neck injuries in Carlisle in September following an attack "exceptional in its brutality", said prosecution QC Andrew Thomas.
Neighbours had heard screaming from the Hungarian's property on Orton Road.
Miklos Verebes, of no fixed address, denies murder and three counts of rape.
Carlisle Crown Court heard Mr Verebes, 29 and also from Hungary, was beside Miss Korosi's body when officers arrived and was covered in her blood.
The trial continues.
