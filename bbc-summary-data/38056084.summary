Wales can rectify Japan problems before facing South Africa, says James King

Wales can resolve the problems of their disappointing performance in the 33-30 win over Japan in time to face South Africa, says forward James King.

Rob Howley's team have faced criticism since needing a last-minute Sam Davies drop goal to beat the Japanese.
The Springboks were beaten 20-18 by Italy and a victory would see Wales claim three autumn international wins for the first time since 2002.
"We were trying... there's nothing that can't be rectified," said King.
"You can say the performance wasn't great, but a win is one step closer to that target of three wins out of four."
Wales lost their opening match of the autumn against Australia but then beat Argentina 24-20 before the nail-biting victory against Japan.
South Africa were thrashed by England before suffering a first-ever defeat by Italy in Florence.
Wales have beaten the Springboks just twice in 31 matches, and were knocked out of the 2015 Rugby World Cup in the teams' last meeting.
Ospreys forward King says Wales have to discount the result in Italy but still have a chance to equal their best-ever return from an autumn series.
"The Springboks are going to be here having lost to Italy but they are not going to be any less of a team," he said.
"Look at the calibre of players they've got - you can't have the Springboks coming to your front door and think they are going to be a walk over.
"They are a very physical unit so I think if we play a little bit the way we did in the World Cup then we should be alright.
"After the game [against Japan] we said it was a bit of a disappointment but a win is still a win and there is another game coming this weekend."
