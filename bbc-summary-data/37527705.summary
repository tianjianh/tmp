Sutton United boss Paul Doswell celebrated the landmark of his 500th match at the club with a home rout over Woking.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roarie Deacon highlighted that long-term faith in a manager can be rewarded as he cut inside to fire the U's in front, midway through the first half.
Sutton had a swagger all afternoon and Ross Stearn volleyed in on 42 minutes after a Deacon cross had deflected fortunately off Brian Saah.
Nick Bailey pivoted nicely from Stearn's corner to make it three just after the interval before Craig McAllister headed in a cross at the near post in the 52nd minute.
Woking's Matt Tubbs lobbed Ross Worner to grab a consolation goal after 75 minutes, but it was too late to make an impact.
