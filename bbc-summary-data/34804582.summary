Merry Hill House and Nelson Mandela House are the last remaining homes run by Wolverhampton City Council.
The decision to close them as part of a plan to save Â£134 million over five years was made at Wednesday's cabinet meeting.
Jessie Bunce, 86, who lives at Merry Hill House is "absolutely devastated" said a family friend.
Paul Tunney said: "Her daughter [is devastated] as well - they are both supporting and consoling one another. As yet we don't know where she is going to go."

The Woden Resource Centre, a day care facility in Wolverhampton will also be shut as part of the plan.
Council leader Roger Lawrence described the closures as "unpalatable" but "unavoidable" due to government cuts.
Councillor Elias Mattu, cabinet member for adults, said: "I do not want any specific timescale set until we have spoken with all of the residents and their relatives."
