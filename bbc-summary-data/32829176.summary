Mr Nkurunziza was playing in his daily kickabout with friends in the capital, Bujumbura.
In the latest unrest, a protester was shot dead in Bujumbura.
Last week, there was a failed coup against Mr Nkurunziza. Senior officials from both the army and police have been accused of involvement.
The protester was shot in the back by police in the opposition stronghold of Musaga, a witness said.
On Wednesday Mr Nkurunziza said in a speech on state radio that an insignificant part of the capital was experiencing unrest while the rest of Burundi was peaceful.
He urged those who have fled the country to return.
The UN refugee agency says that more than 105,000 people have fled Burundi into neighbouring countries since the conflict started.

Mr Nkurunziza also announced a 10-day delay for parliamentary elections, which were due to be held next Tuesday.
He made the decision after a recommendation from the electoral commission, a spokesman said. The African Union and the EU had called for a postponement saying there should be dialogue to ease the tension.
The presidential election is due in June.
Mr Nkurunziza's critics say the third term contravenes the constitution, which requires him to step down after two terms.
Burundi's Constitutional Court says that Mr Nkurunziza's first term does not count because he was elected by parliament and not voters.
