Sales growth at B&M, the discount retailer chaired by former Tesco chief executive Sir Terry Leahy, has slowed considerably in the UK.

The chain, which floated on the stock market in June 2014, reported like-for-like growth of 1.1% for the 13 weeks to 27 June.
That was markedly lower than the 6% recorded in the same period last year.
B&M blamed disappointing weather in May, which held back sales of outdoor seasonal products, for the decline.
Chief executive Simon Arora said: "As consumer spending improves, it is apparent that shoppers remain keen to spend with value retailers and we continue to win market share."
Discount retailers such as Poundland, 99p Stores and B&M have opened hundreds of stores in recent years and won customers from supermarket chains as shoppers seek lower prices.
B&M opened 25 net new stores in the quarter, with some of the new openings being among its most successful.
The company now has 450 outlets in the UK and plans to open a total of 80 this year as it heads towards a target of 850.
It also has 51 stores in Germany mostly under the "Jawoll" brand.
"We remain confident that future store expansion opportunities will allow us to increase market share in both the UK and Germany," B&M said.
Total revenue for the quarter rose 24.4% to Â£456.6m compared with the same period last year.
Shares rose 2.8%, or 9.7p, to 349.7p in morning trading in London, valuing the group at Â£3.5bn.
The shares have risen more than 22% since the float last year.
The flotation resulted in a Â£1bn windfall for the three Arora brothers, who have led the expansion of the company.
