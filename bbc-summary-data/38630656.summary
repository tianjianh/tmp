[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new long-distance walking route from south Wales to Shropshire have been unveiled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposed trail will follow the 129 miles (207km) of the Heart of Wales railway line between Shrewsbury and Swansea.
A feasibility study has been carried out and a new walking route between Craven Arms and Llanelli is being developed.
A crowd funding campaign has been set up to help fund the next stage.
Organisers said work on the first sections of the trail - from Craven Arms to Knighton and Garnswllt to Pontarddulais joining the Wales Coast Path to the National Wetland Centre Wales in Llanelli - is expected to begin in early 2017.
The route is designed to make use of existing public rights of way and to join established walks such as the Shropshire Way, Offa's Dyke Path and Beacons Way.
Money raised from the crowd funding campaign will help pay for gates, footbridges and signs as well as route maintenance.
