The death of a cat found cut in two is being linked to a series of other gruesome cat killings around England, an animal rescue centre has said.

South Norwood Animal Rescue and Liberty (Snarl) said the mutilated remains, found in Bracknell, Berkshire, bore similarities to feline deaths in other parts of the country.
The charity has suggested a single culprit is behind the killings.
Thames Valley Police said the latest death was an "isolated incident".
The force suggested a fox may have killed the tortoiseshell cat found in Bracknell.
But Tony Jenkins, from Snarl, disagreed with police, adding: "Not unless the fox was carrying a large knife."
He said the cat, which was not micro-chipped and had not yet been identified, was cut below its front legs and only its rear had been found, in a manner is similar to a series of mutilations across London and other parts of the country including Manchester and Birmingham, believed to have been carried out by one person.
He added it was also common for there to be no blood at the scene.
Snarl said it had collected about 90 bodies since October last year, and post-mortem examinations had confirmed 30 of the deaths as being linked.
Mr Jenkins has advised cat owners to keep their pets indoors, particularly at night, "because it's the only way we can guarantee their safety".
"If needs be get a harness and a lead and walk them round," he added.
Snarl urged anyone who finds a cat's body or sees anyone mistreating a feline to get in touch.
