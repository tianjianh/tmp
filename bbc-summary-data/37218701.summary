Lewis Haunch collapsed at the event and was pronounced dead in hospital shortly after midnight on Sunday.
Two 17-year-old boys held in Greater Manchester on suspicion of drugs offences have been released on bail.
Erica McGuinness, a friend, said: "All his close friends will remember him for the fun person that he was."
About 40 people held a candle-lit vigil on Sunday in his home town of Leigh in Greater Manchester.
Ms McGuinness said: "Everyone's really upset, he was really popular and it was really sudden.
"We're expecting him to come around the corner and tell us it's a joke, it's going to take us a while to get it into our heads."
She added: "He was a very clever lad, so if he would have known it would have caused harm to him or anybody else he wouldn't have done it."
A total of 58 people were arrested at Leeds Festival, with the majority in relation to drugs offences.
