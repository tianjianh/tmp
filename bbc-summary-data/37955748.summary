Mark Woods encouraged people on social media under #walkwithwalnut to share the last outing on a beach in Cornwall.
Walnut the whippet, who was 18-years-old, has now been put down because of his ill health.
Mr Woods said the reaction from people around the world who had heard about Walnut on social media had been "incredible".
Writing on Facebook, Mr Woods confirmed Walnut had died.
He said: "Walnut passed away this morning at 11.56am. The family and our three whippets, Monty, Nelson and Charlie were also in the room.
"He went very quickly and in my arms. I am writing this post because I owe it to everyone who has supported myself, my family and most importantly Walnut.
"Thank you to the hundreds of people that attended the walk this morning and to all those that had their own walks with their beloved pets at 9.30am all around the world.
"I also want to thank the wonderful people of Newquay for their support which I will never forget as long as I live. God bless you all."
Mr Woods said the pair been through an "awful lot together", including two marriages, three engagements and a move from London to Cornwall.
He said Porth Beach, which is closed to dogs during the summer months, was Walnut's favourite beach.
A Kennel Club spokesman said whippets tended to live until they were thirteen to fourteen years old, so Walnut's age was "impressive" and "certainly unusual for the breed".
"The walk for Walnut is a lovely idea and will no doubt give him the send-off he deserves."
