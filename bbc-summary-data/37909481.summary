Niko Matawalu: Bath Rugby scrum-half signs for Exeter Chiefs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter have signed Fiji international scrum-half Niko Matawalu from Bath until the end of the season, with a view to a longer term deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matawalu has made 10 Premiership appearances since joining Bath from Pro 12 club Glasgow ahead of last season.
The 27-year-old, who can also play as a winger, has won 28 international caps.
"He's an exciting player, someone you describe as an 'X-Factor' type player," Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter told the club's website.
"We're not expecting him to be 100% straight away as he has had a relatively lengthy injury, but he's fully fit now, he's ready to play, and we're hoping he will get some good game time during these autumn internationals."
