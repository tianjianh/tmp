After closing down 3.5% on Monday, Japan's Nikkei 225 opened in positive territory, though only just.
The benchmark was up 0.12% to 16,039.12 points after the opening bell.
By mid-morning however, the index had fallen again and was down 0.93% to 15,869.80 points.
In Australia, Sydney's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index was lower by 1.55% at 5,230.10, following a holiday on Monday.
In addition to worries over the UK's upcoming referendum, investors are also eying the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, both of which are set to hold meetings this week.
Most analysts have said it is unlikely either central bank will announce rate cuts, however.
In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi was down 0.33% at 1,972.57.
In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was flat at 20,500.98 after ending lower on Monday by 2.5%, while the Shanghai Composite was also flat, up just 0.05% to 2,835.57.
