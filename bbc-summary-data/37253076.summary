The Pole came back from a break down and edged a dramatic tie-break before going on to win 7-6 (11-9) 6-3.
Broady, ranked 82nd, was playing in the second round of a Grand Slam, and up against a top-five opponent, for only the second time in her career.
Top seed Serena Williams beat fellow American Vania King 6-3 6-3.
Williams, chasing record seventh US Open and 23rd Grand Slam singles titles, earned her 306th Grand Slam win to tie Martina Navratilova's all-time record.
Romania's Simona Halep, the fifth seed, beat Czech Lucie Safarova 6-3 6-4, while sixth seed and two-time former champion Venus Williams beat Germany's Julia Goerges 6-2 6-3.
Radwanska could overtake Serena Williams and become world number one if results go her way at Flushing Meadows - but she was given a severe test by Broady on Louis Armstrong Stadium.
The 26-year-old from Stockport used her 6ft 2in frame to regularly send down serves above the 120mph mark, backing them up with 35 winners from the net and some flashing groundstrokes.
"She was serving unbelievable," Radwanska said. "120mph serves are not easy to return."
Radwanska, 27, recovered from 5-2 down to earn a tie-break in the first set and saw off four set points, with Broady failing to make three returns and sending a volley long.
It was Radwanska who prevailed when a Broady forehand floated long, but it had taken the former Wimbledon finalist 69 minutes to take the set, and she found herself 2-0 down in the second.
The errors were increasingly coming from Broady's end of the court, however, and Radwanska levelled at 2-2 before firing a backhand winner from out wide to get the decisive break at 4-4.
"I'm so pleased I could come back in that first set," said the Pole. "It was the key set. There was a lot of running and a lot of struggling but it was another two sets for me."
