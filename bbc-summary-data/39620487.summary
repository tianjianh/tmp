The men forced their way in to Bilquis Choudry's home in Giffnock, near Glasgow, on Monday 10 April and made off with Â£4,500 and jewellery.
Police spoke to motorists and residents in Rouken Glen Road one week on.
Writing on Facebook, Fayyaz Rahman said the men had targeted his mother-in-law's home between 17:45 and 18:15.
In his social media post, Mr Rahman urged people to help police identify the men he described as "scumbags" who robbed their victim at knifepoint.
He said a "cousin and a nephew" disturbed the raiders, and managed to take photographs after chasing them along a road.
The pictures showed two people attempting to get into a dark grey Volvo car, with their faces covered.
In an earlier statement, Police Scotland said three masked men had broken into the woman's home at around 17:30 on Monday 10 April.
