Ryan Mills has signed an extension to his contract with Worcester Warriors.

Mills, who can play at fly-half or centre, joined from Gloucester in 2014 and helped Warriors win promotion to the Premiership in his first season.
The 24-year-old has kicked 99 points in 14 appearances this term, skippering them in the European Challenge Cup.
"Recent changes that have happened behind the scenes were massively important in me making my decision to stay," Mills told the club website.
Mills produced a metronomic performance against reigning Premiership and European champions Saracens in February, scoring all of his side's points in Worcester's 24-18 victory.
Worcester have not disclosed the length of Mills' new deal.
He added: "I'm extremely happy off the field and on the field we've been making big progress in recent weeks.
"Now we're all focused on finishing the season strongly and to give us a great platform going into next year."
