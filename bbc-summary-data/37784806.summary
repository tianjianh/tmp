World Series: Chicago Cubs beat Cleveland Indians to level scores

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Chicago Cubs beat the Cleveland Indians 5-1 to win a World Series game for the first time in 71 years and level the best-of-seven series at 1-1.

Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta did not allow a hit in the first five innings in Cleveland to set up a comfortable win.
Kyle Schwarber drove in two runs to continue his dream return from injury.
The Cubs have not won the World Series since 1908 but will end that drought if they win three straight home games this weekend, starting on Friday.
Chicago's famous Wrigley Field stadium has not hosted a World Series game since 1945, when legend has it that a curse was placed on the Cubs after a local tavern owner was asked to leave a game because the smell of his pet goat was upsetting other fans.
Manager Joe Maddon is expecting an even better atmosphere than usual when the series switches to the National League ballpark.
He said: "It's always crazy good, but I'd have to imagine a little bit more than that, especially coming back at 1-1. The folks will be jacked up about the win.
"It's the finest venue there is in professional sports and maybe in all of sports.
"But now having a World Series to root for, it's going to be incredibly special."
It was a first World Series defeat for Cleveland manager Terry Francona, who is the only coach to win his first nine matches in the World Series - having steered the Boston Red Sox to 4-0 sweeps in 2004 and 2007.
If required, the series will return to Cleveland for a sixth game on Tuesday and potentially a decider the following night.
