European football: Luca Toni's big finish and stories you might have missed

The title race in La Liga is going to the wire, although it's now a two- rather than a three-horse race after Atletico Madrid's shock defeat at Levante.

It was also a tight finish in the Netherlands, where's Ajax's final-day draw allowed PSV Eindhoven to retain their title.
Bayern Munich finally wrapped up their fourth successive Bundesliga title, while it was also business as usual in France, where champions Paris St-Germain clocked up another record for the most points accrued.
But what else happened in Europe this weekend? BBC Sport rounds up the stories you might have missed.
Talk about bowing out in style.
Luca Toni called time on his prolific career on Sunday and what a way to finish as the former Italy international scored one of the goals that finally ended Juventus' remarkable unbeaten run.
Having decided to call it a day, Toni, 38, opted to finish the season a week early with a home game against one of his former clubs.
With his current team, Hellas Verona, bottom of Serie A and already relegated, their prospects of giving Toni a winning send-off looked bleak.
But thanks to a first-half penalty from the former World Cup winner, Verona secured an unlikely 2-1 victory as champions Juventus lost for the first time in 27 league games.
Toni, joint top scorer in Serie A last season with 22 goals, said: "I should have stopped four or five years ago, but I kept on scoring so I continued to play.
"It was only after I spoke to my family that I decided to end this wonderful career."
Francesco Totti holds just about every record going at Roma and on Sunday made his 600th Serie A appearance.
The 39-year-old extended his record number of games for his home town club as he chalked up the latest milestone on what might be his final outing at the Stadio Olimpico.
The former Italy international is out of contract at the end of the season and is yet to be offered a new deal to extend his stay into a 24th year.
Totti was given an emotional ovation when he came off the bench with an hour gone and then laid on Roma's final goal for Miralem Pjanic in a 3-0 win over Chievo.
Only Inter Milan legend Javier Zanetti (615) and AC Milan great Paolo Maldini (647) have made more appearances than Totti in Serie A.
When you've spent two-thirds of your entire life with one club, moving on is bound to be an emotional experience and for Joel Matip, this weekend marked the end of an era.
The 24-year-old defender has been with Bundesliga club Schalke since he was a month shy of his ninth birthday. At the end of the season, he will move to Liverpool to help sort out Jurgen Klopp's back line.
On Saturday, Matip played his final home game for Schalke with supporters unfurling a banner that read: "For 16 years, everything given for Schalke - thank you Jimmy."
The Bochum-born Cameroon international was presented with a sackful of mementos before kick-off but was denied a parting victory.
Schalke led through Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's opener but Daniel Maier spoiled Matip's farewell with a late equaliser for Augsburg in a 1-1 draw.
Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa's season and a half at Newcastle could hardly be classed a success - and he was certainly never a goalscorer.
The France centre-back was brought to Tyneside in January 2013, but struggled to establish himself in Alan Pardew's team and ended up moving to Roma in September 2014.
Yanga-Mbiwa is now back in France and has helped Lyon to second place in Ligue 1.
Before Saturday's meeting with third-placed Monaco, the defender, 26, had scored one goal in the previous four and a half years.
But two in the space of half an hour, plus a hat-trick from Alexandre Lacazette, helped Lyon rack up a 6-1 win.
Victory secured them Champions League qualification but Monaco, who had former Everton striker Lacina Troare sent off, could yet drop into the Europa League if they fail to beat Montpellier next weekend.
Imagine doing something so embarrassing you end up apologising to two million people as a result. That is the fate that has befallen Luka Modric.
The Real Madrid midfielder has made himself very unpopular in Slovenia over the past few days. So unpopular, in fact, that he has said sorry to the entire country.
During the latter stages of Real's Champions League victory over Manchester City on Wednesday, Modric was caught on camera saying something deeply offensive to Slovenian referee Damir Skomina.
Having just been substituted, the former Tottenham playmaker took exception to one of the official's decisions.
His remark, which will not be repeated here, was widely condemned and the Croatia international realised he had to atone for his actions.
"First of all, I apologise to the referee Damir Skomina," said Modric, "and then to everyone, especially in Slovenia, who was insulted by my vulgar reaction".
