[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Henry's late strike saved Wolves from their first league defeat of 2015 as they drew at Bolton.

Kenny Jackett's side took the lead within three minutes when Nouha Dicko struck from close range.
Teenage striker Zach Clough then equalised with a direct free-kick and made it 2-1 soon after when he fired past Carl Ikeme from inside the box.
Bolton looked set to move into the top half of the Championship before Henry struck in the 96th minute.
Wolves could not have made a better start, as Dicko latched on to Kevin McDonald's pass before firing past Andy Lonergan from six yards.
But Bolton turned things around during a three-minute period midway through the second half.
First, Clough's free-kick found the corner of Ikeme's goal after Darren Pratley had been brought down and soon after he turned well in the box to curl in Tim Ream's cross.

Clough then almost set up a third for Bolton, when he found Liam Trotter, whose shot from outside the box was saved by Ikeme.
Dicko was twice denied opportunities to shoot thanks to strong challenges from defender David Wheater.
In the second half Bolton debutant Adam Le Fondre went close to scoring when he chested down a Liam Feeney pass, but Ikeme saved his volley at goal.
Bolton, who lost Pratley just after the break to injury, did well to nullify the Wolves attack as Josh Vela prevented Lee Evans and Benik Afobe from causing problems in the box.
Rob Hall fired wide at the other end, but the hosts looked to be heading towards an important victory before eventually succumbing to late pressure.
With just seconds left, Henry fired a 25-yard shot past Lonergan to deny Bolton a first league home win of the new year.
Bolton boss Neil Lennon on Zach Clough:
"Zach's performance was amazing considering he has not kicked a ball for three weeks.
"I don't know where he got the free-kick from because I have never seen him do it before. But he is an outstanding talent and we have to manage him in the right way.
"We can't get carried away. I have to be mindful not to build him up into something he might possibly be. He might never get there but he is a definite talent."
Wolves manager Kenny Jackett:
"I felt we lacked in the first half and Bolton deserved their lead. In the second, they sat quite deep and we continued to try to put the ball behind them which wasn't the right tactic. We should have moved the ball better and got the ball into feet.
"I am always pleased to pick up point away from home. But it was tough for us to break them down and a real bit of quality did that in the end."
