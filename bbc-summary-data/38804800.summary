Sara Connor, 46, and David Taylor, 34, are both charged with murdering Wayan Sudarsa on Bali's Kuta beach last year.
Mr Taylor has admitted he hit Mr Sudarsa with items including binoculars and a beer bottle.
Ms Connor told the Denpasar District Court on Monday she believed Mr Taylor was acting in self-defence.
"I believe David is not an aggressive man," she said. "He was defending himself."
Both Ms Connor and Mr Taylor face up to 15 years in jail if they are found guilty of murder.
The court heard Ms Connor and Mr Taylor were enjoying a night on the beach on 16 August when they became aware her handbag was missing, and separated to search for it.
Mr Taylor has said he approached Mr Sudarsa believing the policeman may have stolen the bag, and the encounter escalated into a fight.
Ms Connor on Monday said she spotted Mr Taylor on top of a man and tried to separate them. She claimed she fled the scuffle after Mr Sudarsa pulled her hair and bit her on the leg.
The court heard Ms Connor did not ask questions when Mr Taylor told her he had left the man "passed out" on the beach.
Ms Connor said she later "panicked" when she learnt Mr Sudarsa was dead. The court heard the pair burnt clothes they were wearing on the night.
Asked why she destroyed evidence, Ms Connor said: "I am still not guilty and look where I am. It was the panic of being in a distant country, not understanding the language."
Outside court, Mr Taylor told reporters he was happy that Ms Connor "told the truth".
"I'm glad the truth is finally coming out about this case," he told reporters. "It's not a murder case, it's a self defence case."
