The show is set to premiere in October at Washington DC's National Theatre and is then expected to head to Broadway early next year.
Tina Fey has been working on the musical with her husband, 30 Rock composer Jeff Richmond.
The 2004 teen comedy starred Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert - but who will take on their roles?
Stepping into Lindsay Lohan's role as Cady Heron, the home-schooled student who disrupts the high school social order, is Erika Henningsen. She was the youngest actress in Broadway history to play the role of Fantine in the Les Miserables.
Queen Bee of the Plastics Regina George - played by Rachel McAdams in the film - will be portrayed by Taylor Louderman. She is currently starring opposite Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie in Kinky Boots on Broadway.
Tony Award nominee Kerry Butler will play Ms Norbury, the maths teacher played by Tina Fey herself on screen. Butler's Broadway credits include Penny Pingleton in the original cast of Hairspray and Eponine in Les Miserables.
Regina's sidekicks Karen Smith and Gretchen Wieners will be played by Kate Rockwell (Bring It On and Legally Blonde) and Ashley Park (Mamma Mia! and The King and I).
Cady's friends Janis and Damian will be played by Barrett Wilbert Weed and Grey Henson.
The show is set to run from 31 October until 3 December with its New York dates still to be decided, depending on the reception it gets.
