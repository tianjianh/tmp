First edition of Wokingham newspaper goes on sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first edition of a new newspaper for Wokingham has gone on sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wokingham Paper was launched following the closure of the Wokingham Times by publisher Trinity Mirror in December.
About 10,000 copies of the 48-page independent paper, which sells for 50 pence, are being printed weekly.
Editor Phil Creighton said: "It's an amazing feeling, I nearly cried. It's been such a journey to go from the idea to have it in my hand."
Mr Creighton said he took on the project as the end of the town's paper had "left a huge gap in the heart of the community".
"I wanted to make sure that news was shared", he said.
Mr Creighton is attempting to raise crowd-sourced funding to sustain the publication.
