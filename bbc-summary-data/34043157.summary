CCTV images of a rape victim being carried nearly unconscious across a street by her suspected attacker have been released by police.

The suspect can be seen taking the 25-year-old woman across Tennant Street, Birmingham, on 19 October 2014, minutes before she was attacked.
The woman had shown "remarkable courage" by allowing the release of the footage, West Midlands Police said.
An image of a key witness, known as Kevin, has previously been released.
The witness, who is believed to be in his 20s, with dwarfism, left the Walkabout bar on Broad Street with the woman at 04:00 BST.
The pair walked towards Granville Street, where the suspect - described as a black man - spoke to Kevin and scooped the woman into his arms, leaving Kevin alone, police said.
A short time later a report was made to the police when a member of the public found the woman in a highly distressed state.
Det Con Danette Calvey said: "There will undoubtedly be people who will watch these images and wrongly judge the woman.
"It must be remembered that this woman has been attacked and that she has displayed remarkable courage by allowing us to release the footage.
"She hopes that these new images may jog someone's memory and that their call may make the difference to her attacker being caught or left to roam the streets."
Det Con Calvey said police were still looking for Kevin, who is believed to have short dark hair.
Asked about the gap between the attack and the CCTV being put out, the force said it did not take decisions to release "footage like this lightly" due to the distress it could cause victims.
But the force said with the woman's consent it had "deemed the time is now right" in the hope the CCTV would prompt new leads.
