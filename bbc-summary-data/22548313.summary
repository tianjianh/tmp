The midfielder's existing deal was due to expire in June, and there had been uncertainty over his future.
"I'm absolutely delighted. Everybody knows I always maintained the dream to stay," the 34-year-old said.

"I want to thank Mr Abramovich for making the dream a reality. I love this club, the staff, the players and especially the supporters."
Lampard became the club's all-time leading scorer last week, overtaking Bobby Tambling's 202-goal record.
He has made 607 appearances for Chelsea since his £11m move from West Ham in June 2001.
Ex-Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is widely tipped to take over from interim manager Rafael Benitez at the end of the season.
The return of Mourinho is thought to have had a bearing on Lampard staying.
Earlier in the month, Lampard said it would be a "great thing" if Real Madrid manager Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge.
Lampard had been linked with a move to the United States, but said: "The thought of helping the club to more success in the forthcoming years is all I ever wanted. I couldn't be happier.
"We've been talking for ages, and even though it went on for quite a period it was always amicable."
Chelsea signed Lampard from West Ham in an £11m deal in 2001. He has won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and a Champions League during his time at the club.
He has scored 17 goals for Chelsea in all competitions this season - his best return since 2009-10, when he netted 27 times.
Benitez said: "Frank is a great professional. He has worked hard in every training session and now, at the end, I think we could see he has improved.
"Some people were surprised when I said that but he has scored a lot of goals in this period. Maybe it was because we were managing him quite well."
Ron Gourlay, Chelsea's chief executive, added: "Frank has been an important player for Chelsea Football Club for a long time and has played a significant part in the club's success.
'We have been talking to him since the end of last year and our discussions have been entirely positive throughout."
