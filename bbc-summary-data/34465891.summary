[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Officials in north Wales have held an investigation after a patient at a Wrexham health centre was given a potentially fatal dose of insulin.

The individual should have received a short-acting type of the drug, but was given a long-acting variety.
Details of the so-called 'Never Incident' - where serious harm or death could occur - were revealed in a report to the Betsi Cadwaladwr health board.
The findings will be discussed by the board at a meeting next week.
According to the quality and performance report, the incident at the unnamed clinic took place in August.
It was one of four separate 'Never Incidents' reported to the board so far in 2015.
In July, a swab used during a surgical procedure at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire was unaccounted for, leading to a patient requiring an additional x-ray test to ensure it had not been left inside them.
In June, a patient underwent treatment on the wrong knee at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
In April, another patient had a procedure carried out on the wrong body part at Glan Clwyd.
This incident has already been the subject of a serious incident review report, which has been passed to the Welsh government.
Jill Newman, assistant director for improvement and business support at the health board, said a full investigation has begun into the August incident, with immediate steps taken to prevent similar errors in future.
A review of the missing swab case has also taken place with "learning points" identified and an action plan being developed.
In the third case, the patient with the wrong knee treatment has gone through follow-up appointments and is pain-free, the report said.
