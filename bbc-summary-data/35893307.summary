The Kaduna State government let fans in for free at the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, which led to severe overcrowding.
The draw keeps the Pharaohs on top of Group G by two points from Nigeria.
Nigeria took the lead on the hour through Warri Wolves' Etebo Oghenekaro before Roma winger Salah's equaliser.
Some supporters climbed up floodlight scaffolding to watch the game, while others sat on the roof of neighbouring houses. No off-pitch incidents were reported.
Only the top two teams from each group are guaranteed progress to the next round in the race to reach Gabon.
