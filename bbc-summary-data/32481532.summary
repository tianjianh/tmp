The Eurasian, Iberian, Canada and Bobcat.
The Eurasian lynx used to be native to Britain and is the biggest - around 60cm tall - about the same size as a Labrador.
The Iberian lynx is the rarest wildcat in the world and can be found in parts of Spain and Portugal.
You can find the Bobcat in North America and the Canada lynx lives in Canada and Alaska.
The Lynx is listed as threatened on the endangered species list, as many poachers hunt them for their fur.
Lynx are usually only active at night and hunt deer, rabbits and hares for food.
