Former Cardiff City captain Jason Perry has challenged fans of the club who are calling for head coach Paul Trollope to be sacked.

The Bluebirds are bottom of the Championship after four consecutive defeats - their latest 2-0 by Leeds.
Perry says Trollope inherited many of the team's problems.
"Do you trust those people at board level to make a decision yet again to bring somebody else in?" Perry asked on BBC Radio Wales.
"That problem is still there. There's nobody with a footballing background on the board."
After losing to Leeds, Trollope claimed he had the backing of club owner Vincent Tan.
Perry added: "He understands his problems at Cardiff City.
"And my one worry is those problems haven't started this season - they've been there last season.
"There's a lack of pace in that squad. They've been struggling for forward players to stretch defenders.
"They've been struggling for legs in midfield - is that because the board won't back him?
"Cardiff City are bottom of the league and that's not by accident because the performances reflect that."
Another former Bluebird, Danny Gabbidon suggested Trollope should be treated the same way as his predecessor Russell Slade.
Slade was regularly the subject of fans' disapproval during his tenure from October 2014 to May 2016, before becoming the Welsh club's head of football ahead of leaving to take over at Charlton Athletic.
Gabbidon said: "He should probably get the same amount of time that Russell Slade had.
"But the more games you lose, the more the pressure mounts.
"It certainly isn't right at the minute.
"Two defeats in a week, three goals conceded against Preston, two more against a team [Leeds] struggling in the Championship themselves.
"They're lacking creativity, they're conceding goals. They don't really look like scoring any and it is worrying times for Cardiff City."
Former Cardiff striker Nathan Blake is pessimistic about their hopes for a season in which they have scored six goals and conceded 14 while winning only once in eight games.
"It's only going to get tougher," said Blake. "There's something missing throughout the club.
"There's a spark missing. What you see there on the pitch on a Saturday is just the evidence of the overall feeling at the club."
Trollope takes his team to Rotherham, a club three places above them in the table, in their next game on Saturday, 24 September.
