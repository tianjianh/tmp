There had been fears two people were in the fire at the Special Ops Desert Storm on Borough Road, St Helens which broke out at about 17:00 BST on Monday.
Fire crews spent the night tackling the blaze which caused the roof of the building to collapse and the evacuation of Pilkington's factory nearby.
A large number of tyres ignited in the fire, the fire service said.
The spokesman added that six crews tackled the blaze at its height.
