Doncaster sign Sheffield United defender Andy Butler on loan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers have signed Sheffield United defender Andy Butler on loan until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old joined the Blades in the summer but made just one appearance, before being loaned out to former club Walsall last month.
He played seven times for the Saddlers and boss Dean Smith had been keen to retain his services.
Butler joins a Doncaster side that is currently one point above the relegation zone.
