At the Place de la Republique people hug, cry, lay flowers and a few sing the national anthem. The site is close to the Petit Cambodge restaurant and Le Carillon bar where gun attacks occurred last Friday.

After the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015 the Place de la Republique was where a million people gathered in a show of unity.  And following last week's attacks, it is again a scene of memorial and strength.

The deadliest attack of the night of 13 November came at a concert venue in Boulevard Voltaire, in the 11th district, where rock group Eagles of Death Metal was playing. The 1,500-seat Bataclan hall was sold out. Eighty-nine people died as attackers fired Kalashnikov-type assault rifles into the crowd. Many others are in a critical condition in hospital.
