European Challenge Cup: Gloucester 20-10 La Rochelle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester secured top spot in their group and a European Challenge Cup quarter-final place with victory over French side La Rochelle at Kingsholm.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Greig Laidlaw landed a penalty before converting tries from Rob Cook and Billy Twelvetrees as the hosts led 17-3 at the break.
The French side's only first-half points came from Julien Audy's boot.
Benjamin Lapeyre got La Rochelle's try after the break, only for Laidlaw to respond with a second penalty.
Despite making several changes for the European fixture after their Premiership loss to Exeter, the hosts still had six internationals in the starting line-up, including Scotland scrum-half Laidlaw, who kicked half of Gloucester's points.
Matt Kvesic, the only Cherry and Whites player included in Eddie Jones' new-look England squad on Wednesday, came off the bench in the second half.
Gloucester director of Rugby David Humphreys told BBC Radio Gloucestershire:

"The big thing today was getting the win and remaining unbeaten with five wins out of five and securing a home quarter final, and we've done that.
"The first half was pretty good. Going in at 17-3 was a good spot to be in but we knew La Rochelle would come out very physically in the second half, and we knew had to defend well. They had a big pack and we tried to move them around and create mis-matches individually but we didn't manage to take any other opportunities.
"Thoroughout the pool we've only secured one bonus point so far that's a disappointment because at this stage every point matters. We'll now prepare well (for the last game) and pick a team to go to Zebre and win."
