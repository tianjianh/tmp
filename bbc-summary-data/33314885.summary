Pupil-premium impact 'will take time', says spending body

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Money allocated to schools for poorer pupils is yet to make an impact, the spending watchdog has said in a report.

The National Audit Office (NAO) said although the pupil premium had "potential", there was still "more to do" by schools and government.
The government says it wants every child to benefit from a good education, regardless of their background.
Funding in some of the poorest schools had fallen by 5% in the past three years, the NAO estimated.
About Â£2.5bn was given to schools in 2014-15 as pupil-premium funding - money allocated for children from poorer backgrounds.
Two million children between the ages of five and 16 qualify for extra funding, out of seven million school-aged children.
The aim of the pupil premium is to "close the gap" between richer and poorer children by improving academic performance.
The NAO report says although school leaders are now focusing on improving outcomes for poorer children, the educational gap between poorer and wealthier children has changed only marginally.
"While the attainment gap has narrowed since 2011, it remains wide and, at this stage, the significance of the improvements is unclear," the report says.
The NAO is calling for a review of the way money is calculated for disadvantaged children, because not all of them are being identified for extra funding.
The introduction of universal credit and free school meals for all infants, it says, make it more difficult to identify disadvantaged pupils.
And some schools in the most disadvantaged areas are actually worse off because of cuts in other areas of the schools budget.
"Some schools with very disadvantaged intakes have less money per pupil now, in real terms, than in 2010, despite the extra funding provided by the pupil premium," the report says.
"We estimate that the per-pupil funding of 16% of the most disadvantaged secondary schools fell by more than 5% in real terms between 2010-11 and 2014-15."
Meanwhile, the NAO says, the impact of the pupil premium is reduced because it is often not being spent effectively.
Ofsted, it says, following school visits between September and December 2014, found "poor provision" for disadvantaged pupils in 8% of primary schools and 21% of secondary schools.
And the NAO estimates schools have spent an extra Â£430m on teaching assistants since the introduction of the fund, calling this a "high-cost approach".
The report says: "Research suggests that the typical deployment and use of teaching assistants, under everyday conditions, is not leading to improvements in academic outcomes.
"Schools could waste money on ineffective activities for many years without challenge."
Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: "The high degree of local discretion has benefits and costs.
"Some schools don't appropriately focus funding on disadvantaged pupils, and some spend funds on activities which are not demonstrably effective."
A government official said: "The NAO's report recognises the important role which the pupil premium has had in improving educational outcomes, and ultimately life chances of some of the most disadvantaged young people.
"However, we know there is more to be done to tackle educational inequality and we will consider the findings of the NAO report carefully."
