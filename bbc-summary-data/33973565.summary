He said she was a resident of Hong Kong, and reports there suggest she was Vivian Chan. The Foreign Office would not confirm the name.
A school where Ms Chan studied said she was a "tremendous role model".
Britons have not been advised against visiting Bangkok, but they have been told to "take extra care".
Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: "Deeply saddened to hear a British national was killed in the horrific Bangkok bombing. My thoughts are with her family & all those affected."
Nine foreigners were among those killed in the attack at the Erawan Hindu shrine. More than 120 people were injured.
Thai police have released images of a suspect they want to question.
Reports suggest Ms Chan was 19 and had been studying law in the UK.
The Harrow International School Hong Kong said people there were "deeply saddened" by Ms Chan's death.
In a statement, the school said: "Vivian was a cherished member of the school's first cohort of leavers in June 2014.
"She was a tremendous role model in and a hugely committed, caring and supportive member of our school community; she will be sorely missed.
"The school has been in contact with Vivian's family to express its most sincere condolences on her passing and is co-ordinating condolence and support arrangements for its students, alumnae, teachers and parents."
Mr Hammond called the bomb attack a "callous act of violence against completely innocent and unsuspecting members of the public".
He said: "My thoughts are with the victims, their families and loved ones, and with the Thai people.
"Foreign Office officials are in close contact with the Thai authorities and have offered UK assistance in the investigation of this abhorrent act."
Thai government spokesman Maj Gen Weerachon Sukhontapatipak said no motive was being ruled out, but that the bomber did not appear to be Thai and the attack was "quite different" from previous bombings by southern Thai insurgents.
