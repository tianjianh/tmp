The long-awaited Transit Elevated Bus ran its first test in Hebei province this week.
Powered by electricity, the bus is able to carry up to 300 passengers.
The scheme's prompted criticism from some though, as vehicles must be less than two metres high to pass under what's been dubbed a "bus on stilts".
