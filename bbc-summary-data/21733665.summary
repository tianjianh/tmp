[SN]TITLE[SN]
Issa Hayatou is re-elected unopposed as Caf president

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameroonian Issa Hayatou has been re-elected unopposed as Confederation of African Football (Caf) president for a final four-year term in office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 66-year-old, who was voted into power in 1988, has already said this seventh term will be his final period as head of the organisation.
Hayatou, who was applauded by delegates at the Caf congress in Marrakech, also received a special certificate from Fifa to commemorate his silver jubilee on its  executive committee.
Ivorian Jacques Anouma wanted to oppose Hayatou at the elections, but a rule change prevented him from doing so.  His attempt to overturn the decision to disqualify non-executive members from the election was rejected by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas).
Hayatou used his re-election to make reference to Anouma's challenge.
"The presidents of the federations approved an amendment preventing a few of them from participating in the race for the Caf presidency, which now permits only those who have held positions of responsibility within the institution to run for presidency," Hayatou told delegates.
"The conduct of the Executive Committee along with the members of national associations during this case was exemplary. The principle of sovereignty of the General Assembly was recognised by the Court of Arbitration for Sport."
Hayatou, the son of a sultan from the northern city of Garoua, represented Cameroon at basketball and middle-distance running.
He is the fifth Caf president and by far the longest serving.
