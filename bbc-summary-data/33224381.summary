Body parts belonging to Becky Watts, 16, were found at a house in Bristol in March.
Shauna Hoare, 21, has been charged alongside her boyfriend Nathan Matthews, 28, Becky's stepbrother.
New forensic tests had helped to establish the circumstances around her death and led to new evidence in the case, police said.
The pair also face further new charges, including conspiracy to commit false imprisonment, preventing lawful burial and possession of a prohibited weapon.
They have also been charged with four counts of making indecent images of children.
Mr Matthews, from Warmley, has also been charged with sexual assault and voyeurism, in allegations not related to Becky.
He faces a fresh charge of perverting the course of justice and is due to stand trial in October.
Det Supt Liz Tunks said it had been a "meticulous and exhaustive" investigation.
"Our thoughts and sympathies are with Becky's family," she said.
"This has been a very difficult time for them and they have had to endure yet more pain as we have worked to understand the full circumstances surrounding her death."
Four others - Karl and Donovon Demetrius, both aged 29, Jaydene Parsons, 23, and James Ireland, 23 - are all charged with assisting an offender.
Becky was last seen at her family home in Crown Hill, Bristol, on 19 February.
Her body parts were found at a house in the Barton Hill area of the city on 2 March.
