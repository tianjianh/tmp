"Cascading" water at a temperature of about 80C [176F] brought down a suspended ceiling at the Victoria Centre store at about 22:40 BST on Tuesday.
It poured through from a rooftop room, leaving the top floor under three inches of water.
Stock was "significantly" damaged.
The building itself was also damaged, and the shop remained closed on Wednesday.

One firefighter said: "We were struggling to find the source of the leak.
"Crews were deployed to salvage stock, [but staff] are going to be busy for a number of days."
A spokeswoman for John Lewis said the store would remain closed on Wednesday as there was no power or lighting.
She added: "We are assessing the damage and have already started the clean-up operation, which will continue as our partners arrive for work this morning."
