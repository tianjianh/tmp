Smoke was seen coming from the windows and roof of the unoccupied Banbury Road building at about 23:30 GMT on Saturday following a suspected arson attack.
Twenty-six firefighters went inside the burning property to check no-one was trapped.
Incident commander Guy Dunkley called it a "challenging incident due to the complex layout and size of the building".
He said: "The swift action of the initial crews brought the fire under control, limiting the damage to the rest of the building."
Thames Valley Police and South Central Ambulance Service were also at the scene.
A fire investigation team is working with police to discover the cause of the blaze.
A second fire in the city overnight is also being investigated.
A club doorman called the fire service at 02:04 after a fire started at a hair salon on the Cowley Road. It is being treated as suspicious.
Police said they were "keeping an open mind" as to whether the two fires were linked.
