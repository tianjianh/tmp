The Nigeria international, 27, told BBC Sport: "I feel at home here and once the opportunity to extend was finalised, I signed it straight away.
"Playing with this incredible squad and in front of our amazing fans gives me a special excitement and buzz.
"I can see the direction the club is going and I feel honoured to be a part of the long-term plan."
The Super Eagle joined the Hornets from Udinese in July 2014 and his 20 goals helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 2014-15 season.
He scored 17 goals in 42 games last season as the Vicarage Road side finished 13th in the top flight and reached the FA Cup semi-final.
Since arriving at the club Ighalo has scored 37 times in 80 appearances.
Ighalo, who has played in Norway, Italy and Spain, has also established himself with his country, scoring three goals in nine international appearances.
