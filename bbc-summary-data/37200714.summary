The haze is an annual feature of life in the region. At its largest, it measures hundreds of kilometres across. It spreads to Malaysia, Singapore, the south of Thailand and the Philippines, causing a significant deterioration in air quality.
It has been blamed for illness and death.
Dry conditions and wind directions affect how the haze lingers, as the BBC's weather presenter Ben Rich explains.
