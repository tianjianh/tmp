MP Drew Hendry believes there are plans for the tanker to dock on Wednesday.
The officer trainees, who are studying at City of Glasgow College, are among 2,500 seafarers stranded on Hanjin vessels.
Ports around the world are refusing to let the troubled company's ships dock after it filed for bankruptcy.
Seafarers union Nautilus named the cadets as Ruaridh Hanna, David Gorniak, Graeme Deacon and Gavin McPhail.
Three of them joined the Louisiana vessel in May and were due to leave on 2 September, the union said.
It understood that they have been told the vessel will berth in Singapore on Wednesday morning.
Mr Hendry, the SNP's transport spokesman at Westminster, said an earlier plan to transfer the cadets at the weekend failed.
Marine services company CMI Offshore had offered to use a ship transfer vessel to get the cadets off the tanker and take care of any documentation.
However, the plan fell through.
Mr Hendry called on the UK government to put pressure on Hanjin to ensure the cadets get home safely.
He said: "I now believe that there is a proposal for the vessel to dock on 28 September.
"The cadets have been let down before when a previous ship transfer arrangement failed to materialise so we must now ensure that this proposed berthing happens.
"I am grateful to the Seafarers Union, Nautilus and CMI Offshore Group for their help in keeping the pressure on, but The Foreign and Commonwealth Office must now also put pressure on Hanjin to make sure that his vessel berths safely on Wednesday and that arrangements are in place to bring the shipmates home.''
Last week one of the cadets, Mr Hanna, from Beauly in the Highlands, told BBC Radio Scotland he was trying to stay positive.
A spokesman for the Nautilus seafarers union said: "Nautilus believes it is imperative that these cadets are allowed to return home at the earliest opportunity and that their ordeal is finally brought to an end.
"We hope that all the various parties involved in the operation and management of the vessel will put an end to the uncertainty which has dragged on for too long."
The troubled shipping group has debts of more than $5bn and has struggled to raise funding to rescue $14bn (Â£10.5bn) worth of cargo stranded round the world following its collapse.
Hanjin filed for receivership in South Korea in August after attempts to bail out the indebted company failed.
There are an estimated 89 Hanjin ships out of its 141-vessel fleet in difficulty, and some have been seized by creditors.
