The 29-year-old joined Spurs in 2014 but returned to former club Sevilla on loan and went on to win the Europa League with the Spanish team.
He signed a four-year deal at White Hart Lane but has played just 25 times for the club - and was sent off on his Premier League debut.
"I am very happy to join a great team like Roma," Fazio said.
