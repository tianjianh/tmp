Andre Ayew vows to 'get better' after Swansea winner at Villa

Swansea City match-winner Andre Ayew says there is better to come from him as he grows more accustomed to the Premier League.

Ayew, 25, scored a late winner against Aston Villa on Saturday to end Swansea's six-match run without a win.
The Ghana midfielder has now scored five goals in 11 appearances since joining Swansea on a free transfer from Marseille over the summer.
"I believe if I continue to work hard I can do much more," he said.
"It's about getting to know the league better, getting to know my players better. They are helping me with that and giving me the confidence.
"I'm sure with time I can even get better."

Ayew was disappointed not to have given Swansea the lead at Villa Park when a slightly heavy touch allowed on-rushing goalkeeper Brad Guzan to smother his shot in front of goal.
The miss proved even more significant as Guzan's save set Villa on their way to a counter attack that brother Jordan Ayew finished to put Villa ahead.
"It's good for him, but it's even better for us because we got the three points. I'm happy for him but I'm happier for us," added the elder Ayew brother.
Swansea's visit to Villa had been billed as a meeting between two managers under pressure.
Garry Monk's position at Swansea had been brought into focus after failing to win since August, while Tim Sherwood was under far greater scrutiny with just one win to Villa's name all season.
Doubts over Sherwood's future will intensify, as he acknowledged after the match, but Ayew insisted there has been no tension within the Swansea camp.
"The manager never showed any pressure," he said.
"He stayed confident and believed in us. We also believe in what we do and believe in what he proposes to us in training.
"We have great confidence in our manager. That wasn't an issue at all. We just wanted to win because we are all like a family.
"When things are difficult in a family you need to stay united and fight together. That's what we did."
While happy to accept the plaudits for his winning goal, Ayew described Gylfi Sigurdsson's equaliser as the "real match-winner".
Sigurdsson scored a trademark free-kick six minutes after Swansea had fallen behind, giving the visitors fresh impetus to believe a first away win of the season was possible and fuelling Villa's fears of losing again.
"If we hadn't have scored that it would have been a whole different game. But we got the goal and the game changes," said Ayew, already a contender for the best signing of the season.
"We're happy and we hope we're going to continue you like that."
