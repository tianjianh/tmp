[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mary Lou McDonald names politicians she says were involved in tax evasion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Sinn Féin representative has used parliamentary privilege to name Irish politicians she claims were involved in a tax evasion scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme allowed people to deposit money outside the Republic of Ireland but still have access in the state.
There were no records in Ireland of the deposits.
Five former ministers named by Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald have denied they held so-called Ansbacher accounts.
Ms McDonald had also alleged that an inquiry into the evasion scheme was halted because it involved former government minister Des O'Malley.
Mr O'Malley was also a founder and former leader of the Progressive Democrats party.
Ms McDonald said the inquiry into the scheme was shut down in 2004 by Mary Harney, who was the minister responsible and also leader of the Progressive Democrats.
The others named as being involved in the scheme were former EU commissioners, Ray MacSharry and Maire Geoghegan Quinn of Fianna Fail; former Fine Gael finance minister Richie Ryan; former Fianna Fail justice minister Gerry Collins and an "S Barrett".
