[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers consolidated second place in the Premiership as Ian Cathro lost his first match as Hearts head coach.

The hosts had the better first-half chances and moved into the lead when Rob Kiernan headed in James Tavernier's free-kick.
Hearts had earlier netted through Don Cowie, but the midfielder was flagged offside.
A long throw-in by Lee Wallace found its way to Barrie McKay to poke home Rangers' second.
Mark Warburton's side now lead Hearts by five points and go four clear of Aberdeen, who have a game in hand. Celtic, with three games in hand, lead the division by eight points.
Hearts had beaten Rangers 2-0 in Robbie Neilson's last match in charge on 30 November, with Jon Daly in interim charge for last weekend's 2-2 draw with Ross County.
Warburton's men had recovered from their loss at Tynecastle by beating Aberdeen to reclaim second place and Rangers were determined to hold on to it with several openings before Kiernan scored.
Wallace was wide with one effort and saw another saved and Kenny Miller lobbed wide from a promising position.

However, the home fans would see their team in front by half-time, Kiernan powerfully nodding home Tavernier's free-kick. It was the defender's first goal since joining Rangers in June 2015.
Rangers continued where they left off in the second half and took advantage of sloppy defending by Igor Rossi and Facyal Rherras when Wallace's throw was not cut out and McKay applied the finish - his first goal since netting in the League Cup in July.
Joe Garner and Miller's replacement Martyn Waghorn had further efforts as the home side finished strongly, with one of Waghorn's shots requiring a fine block by Jack Hamilton.
Hearts' best spell had come in the first half and Cowie celebrated after finishing on the rebound following a Callum Paterson shot that was saved by Wes Foderingham.
However, the visitors and their new head coach, who joined after spells on the coaching staff at Rio Ave, Valencia and Newcastle, would be left frustrated by the linesman's raised flag.
Hearts' Jamie Walker fired wide but was later booked for simulation in what proved to be a disappointing debut for 30-year-old Cathro.
Match ends, Rangers 2, Heart of Midlothian 0.
