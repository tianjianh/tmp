The actor will join Emma Watson as Belle and Dan Stevens as the Beast, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
Lumiere is a charismatic maitre d' who is turned into a candelabra when a curse is cast over the Beast's castle.
Stanley Tucci has also been cast as Cadenza the grand piano, a new character described as a neurotic maestro.
Filming on the live action adaptation of Disney's 1991 hit is set to start in May, and will be released in US cinemas on 17 March, 2017.
In January it was announced that Harry Potter star Watson had been cast as Belle.
Josh Gad, who voiced Olaf the snowman in Disney's animated hit Frozen, is also on board as Gaston's sidekick LeFou.
Other stars include Luke Evans as villain Gaston, Sir Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Audra McDonald as Garderobe and Emma Thompson as Mrs Potts, the castle teapot.
The original is one of the few animations to be nominated for a best picture Oscar, and spawned a Broadway play which ran for 13 years.
