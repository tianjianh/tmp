Family's 'joy' at raising £100,000 for son's brain tumour treatment

A family have told of their "unspeakable joy" after raising more than £100,000 for their son to have pioneering brain tumour treatment.

Ollie Gardiner, 12, from Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, recovered after initially being diagnosed in May 2015.
But earlier this year his parents were told the cancer had come back, and his condition was considered "incurable".
The fundraising effort was to get him a new treatment not available on the NHS. Ollie described the news as "amazing".
His father Peter said they were "taking each day at a time" and were "hugely grateful for knowing we have an army of supporters behind us".
But the family said on a Facebook page for Ollie: "We are not out of the woods yet".
The original plan for Ollie's treatment was to take him to Austria, but his parents have since found a specialist in London who is setting up a trial, which would provide the "one credible treatment for Ollie's relapse".
"We still don't know what the cost will be, and we shall keep fundraising to ensure Ollie gets all the medicines he needs," Mr Gardiner said.
"I can't describe the relief of finally getting a treatment in place and that we won't have to tear our family in two for so long."
Mr Gardiner said his son would shortly have surgery to install equipment required for the treatment.
"We wouldn't be in a position to do this without your help.
"Ollie and our whole family will be forever grateful to you," Mr Gardiner wrote in a message on his son's page.
