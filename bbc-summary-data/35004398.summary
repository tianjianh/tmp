A four-screen Everyman cinema and burger-chain Byron are the first two tenants announced for Bell Court.
Demolition of existing units and building work for the new site is set to start in the new year, with the site opening in 2017.
More tenants for the site are set to be announced later, developers UK & European Investments said.

Previously known as Stratford Town Square, when finished the site will cover more than 70,000 sq ft (6,503.21 sq m), with a 14th century bell previously hanging from Bell Court reinstalled at the High Street entrance.
A former supermarket and existing retail unit will be demolished to make way for three ground-floor restaurants, a two-storey restaurant, the cinema and retail space.
Entrances onto High Street, Rother Street, Terrett Court and Wood Street will also be redesigned.
John Stacey, asset management director for the company, said the "important" project hopes to make the area "a desirable and high quality destination".
Lynda Organ, Stratford District Council's portfolio holder for finance and physical resources, said the Bell Court redevelopment will make the area a "thriving hub" for residents and visitors.
The council's planning committee approved the plans.
