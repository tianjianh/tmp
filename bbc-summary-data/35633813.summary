Green Party MP Caroline Lucas says she is "disappointed" at Tory London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith's decision to campaign for an EU exit.

Ms Lucas said the environmental campaigner was a "friend" but that it was "overwhelmingly the case" that EU laws helped protect nature.
She also said the public would lose interest if the campaign became "16 weeks of facts and figures".
Mr Goldsmith said he would vote Out because of "democratic accountability".
Ms Lucas told the BBC she wanted to see a "values-based and visionary pitch" for the UK to remain a member of the EU in order to keep voters interested.
She said she did not know which factors influenced Mr Goldsmith's decision, but said the environment benefited from the "cross-boundary solutions" of the EU.
Setting out his reasons to campaign for Out in a City AM article, Mr Goldsmith said: "Real power in Brussels rests in institutions that are accountable to no one."
