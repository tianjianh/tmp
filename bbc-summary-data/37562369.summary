Howell was the club's leading wicket-taker in the T20 Blast this summer, with 24 at an average of 16.04.
The 28-year-old will join up with Bangladesh Premier League side Khulna Titans in November, despite warnings about the security of western players.
"We are a club on the up and I want to be a part of that," he said.
"I love playing with this group of players and I believe we can win more trophies together."
