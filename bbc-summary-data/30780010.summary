Cadbury's Creme Egg outrage and other 'ruined' recipes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They came for our biscuits. They came for our tea. Now they want our eggs. Cadbury's Creme Eggs, that is.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A recipe change by Cadbury's US owners has provoked the online outcry.
It's because the shell is now made from "standard, traditional Cadbury milk chocolate" not Dairy Milk.
Mondelez International, owned by Kraft Foods, is also introducing five eggs in a pack instead of three and six-packs. They're on sale with singles and 12-packs.
Kraft Foods bought Cadbury in 2010 and its global snacks business under the name of Mondelez International.
A Mondelez International spokesman said: "The fundamentals of the Cadbury Creme Egg remain exactly the same - delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love.We have always used a range of milk chocolate blends for different products."
The spokesman added the eggs may have used Dairy Milk in its shell in recent years but it has never been advertised as such.
Mini Eggs are also made from standard traditional Cadbury milk chocolate.
Creme Eggs were first sold in the UK in 1971 and they're only sold from January in the run-up to Easter.
Anyway, while you process your yellow gooey outrage, here are some other recipe changes that didn't go down well.
The most famous recipe change came in 1985.
Coca-Cola made its first formula change in 99 years (since 1886) when it launched New Coke.
People were so outraged the company was forced to restock shelves with the original coke.
It rebranded to Coca-Cola Classic three months later.
There were hundreds of complaints after Kellogg's changed the recipe for Special K in May 2013.
A petition was started and the firm's Facebook page had a deluge of unhappy cereal eaters.
The recipe for Special K had been unchanged since 1983.
The firm was criticised in 2012 after a change in its recipe for Milk Tray.
The orange truffle replaced the traditional orange cream.
There was also a big debate about changes to the hazelnut whirl.
Coffee creams and mocha-flavoured chocolates were ditched entirely as was the old paper menu.
Twinings changed a 180-year recipe for its Earl Grey in 2011.
Four months later the tea company reintroduced the original under a new label - Earl Grey The Classic Edition after complaints from tea drinkers.
United Biscuits cut the fat from McVitie's Digestives in 2009.
Fans said the result was a blander biscuit.
However, the company claimed it hadn't changed the recipe for more than two years.
In November 2010 Heinz reduced the salt in the popular brown sauce.
Its fans weren't happy.
It used to contain 2.1g of salt per 100g but was reduced to 1.3g to meet new government criteria but calories and carbohydrates both went up.
Michelin-starred chef Marco Pierre White even sent back his sausages and mash, covered in HP Sauce, at Piers Morgan's Kensington pub The Hansom Cab in 2011 because he thought the food was dodgy.
It turned out he didn't like the new taste of the sauce.
