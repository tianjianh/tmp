St Paul's protest: Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser quits

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Church of England should do nothing which could "lead to violence" against anti-capitalism protesters, the canon chancellor of St Paul's Cathedral has said after resigning from his post.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Giles Fraser quit "with great regret and sadness", having been sympathetic to activists camping in the churchyard.
He told the BBC he hoped a solution between the two sides would be negotiated, rather than enforced.
The cathedral will reopen on Friday lunchtime after a week-long closure.
It shut on health and safety grounds because of the large number of tents outside.
A special service will be held to mark the reopening at 12:30 BST but its dome and galleries will stay shut "for the time being", a spokeswoman said.
Differences over the handling of the protest are thought to have prompted Dr Fraser's decision, the BBC's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said.
Demonstrators, who are protesting against alleged corporate greed and inequality, have vowed to remain for several weeks.
The City of London Corporation's planning committee is due to hear legal advice on Friday and decide whether to take court action against the demonstrators.
Occupy London Stock Exchange (OLSX) said it had reorganised the camp to allow the cathedral's reopening, but said the issue of legal action was "a minefield" in terms of land ownership and the human rights.
Dr Fraser, who was a former vicar of Putney, had taken up the cathedral post, a Crown appointment, in 2009.
"This is not a simple issue and I don't think anybody is trying to claim moral high ground on this at all," he said.
"My colleagues who've acted differently to me are quite right in saying that they want to reopen the cathedral; they want the cathedral to get on with its life.
"And, if I can argue their side as well, the truth of the matter is there are all sorts of people who are being adversely affected by the camp and I would like the camp to move on too, because I think it does have an effect on small traders and ordinary people in the area.
"But what I'm not prepared to do is sanction the use of force in order to do that."
After Dr Fraser's resignation, the Dean of St Paul's, the Right Reverend Graeme Knowles, said he was "sorry to see him go".
"Giles has brought a unique contribution to the life and ministry of St Paul's," he said.
"He has developed the work of the St Paul's Institute and has raised the profile of our work in the City.
"We are obviously disappointed that he is not able to continue to his work with Chapter during these challenging days.
"We will miss his humour and humanity and wish Giles and his family every good wish into the future."
Ronan McNern from OLSX said Dr Giles was a "man of principles" and activists were "very grateful for the respect and support" he had shown them by defending their right to protest.
"The fact that he has resigned shows a clear split within the cathedral."
Another spokesman for the group said if Dr Fraser wanted to join the camp they would provide him with a tent.
The protesters said they were still open for dialogue.
When the camp was first set up, Dr Fraser said he was happy for the demonstrators to stay and asked police to scale back their presence.
He has refused to sanction the use of force to remove them as pressure mounts on the cathedral to join in legal action against protesters, our correspondent said.
The Bishop of London, the Rt Revd Richard Chartres, who had also called on the protesters to go, said Dr Fraser was an "important voice in the Church" and should continue to be heard.
"I regret his resignation because his is a very important voice, and while obviously it's a matter between him, the dean, and the rest of the chapter, I've got a certain pastoral responsibility for Giles.
"I think his is a voice which really ought to be heard," Dr Chartres said.
"It would be a tragedy if it was silenced."
The cathedral claimed to be losing Â£20,000 a day since its closure.
