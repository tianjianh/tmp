Alfie Mawson headed in Adam Hammill's cross to open the scoring and set up Winnall's first after half-time.
Dale's Nathaniel Mendez-Laing pulled a goal back, but Winnall turned in Ashley Fletcher's cross to make in 3-1.
Marley Watkins drilled in a fourth before Winnall nodded in to complete a treble and Kevin Long headed the sixth.
Rochdale manager Keith Hill told BBC Radio Manchester:

"If I'm too hard on the players now after that type of result, that could have a double negative.
"There are enough negatives in today's performance and result to last a season. I've got to come up with the right solutions.
"If I go too heavy and too hard on the players, it could break them for the rest of the season."
