Hamilton Accies: Giannis Skondras signs new Hamilton contract

Greek defender Giannis Skondras has signed a new one-year contract with Hamilton Academical.

Accies had announced at the end of last season that the 27-year-old had decided to return to his homeland.
But the right-back, who joined Accies in January after leaving PAOK, has now agreed a new deal.
Skondras, who made 18 appearances for the Scottish Premiership club, will be available for Saturday's League Cup game at home to Queen of the South.
