A new exhibition has opened reflecting the history of a centuries-old game of football.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Royal Shrovetide Football, which is played on Shrove Tuesday and Ash Wednesday each year in Derbyshire, dates back to at least 1667.
It features residents of Ashbourne competing to move a ball to posts at either end of the town.
The new exhibition includes balls from games past, photographs, film footage and newspaper clippings.
Shrovetide historian Trilby Shaw said it featured some balls that had not "been seen for generations".
This year's game takes place on 28 February and 1 March.
