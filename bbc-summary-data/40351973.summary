[SN]TITLE[SN]
Two men cleared of Bishopbriggs school shooting

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two men have been cleared of shooting a man outside a primary school as pupils left for the day.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Burns, 56, and Alexander Porter, 48, both from Paisley, denied attempting to murder 35-year-old Ross Sherlock.
The shooting took place at about 15:00 on 24 September 2015 outside St Helen's Primary in Bishopbriggs.
Judge Lord Matthews formally acquitted Mr Burns and Mr Porter of the attempted murder due to "insufficient evidence".
Mr Sherlock, who was at the school to collect his daughter, was shot at three times with a handgun by a man wearing a yellow fluorescent jacket.
One of the bullets hit his right arm and fractured it.
He ran off and the gunman was seen getting into a silver Volkswagen Golf. The car was discovered on fire at about 15:30 in Wood Lane, Bishopbriggs.
A number of parents who were picking up their children at the time, including Mr Sherlock, gave evidence at the High Court in Glasgow.
None of them could identify the gunman or the getaway driver.
Mr Burns and Mr Porter are still on trial at the High Court in Glasgow accused of an acid attack on journalist Russell Findlay in Glasgow's west end on 23 December 2015.
They deny the charge.
The trial continues.
