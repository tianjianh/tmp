Wolves head coach Walter Zenga has attributed their unbeaten start to the season to his players' spirit.

Zenga's side came from behind to win 3-1 at local rivals Birmingham City and seal a second league win this term.
When asked about his starting XI having 10 players who were at the club last season, he told BBC WM: "They're good players and they only need a warm up.
"They understood what is the spirit of Wolves and what they have to do to create enthusiasm."

Of Wolves' starters against Blues, only striker Jon Dadi Bodvarsson did not play for the club last season and the Iceland striker got on the scoresheet as Wanderers scored three times in the second half to cancel out Che Adams' opener for the hosts.
"Our style is to give 100% all the time in training," Zenga continued. "Not only in the physical standpoint but concentrating on what you are going to do every single day.
"I don't know where we are [in the table] and I don't know how many points we have because the first man in this club who has to stay calm and concentrate is me."
