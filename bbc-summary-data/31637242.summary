Morgan Spence, from Kilbarchan, already has experience in recreating movie classics in Lego and has been used in a Red Cross disaster campaign.
The 15-year-old put together a scene from The Grand Budapest Hotel for the chat show.
He said a minute of footage takes weeks in Lego brick time and that he wants to take up filmmaking as a career.
He told Kimmel: "I've always had a love of Lego, even since I was three years old, and it's still my hobby now.
"It depends on how complex the film I'm recreating is but usually for say a minute of film it can take a couple of weeks."
And the young Renfrewshire animator revealed that he had even swallowed the odd piece of Lego in his time.
