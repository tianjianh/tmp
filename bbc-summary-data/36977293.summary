[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ian Bailey facing trial over Sophie Toscan du Plantier murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A British journalist has been ordered to stand trial in France for the murder of a film producer in the Republic of Ireland almost 20 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sophie Toscan du Plantier was found beaten to death near her cottage in Schull, County Cork, on 23 December 1996.
Ian Bailey, a neighbour of the victim, was arrested in Ireland over her killing but was never charged.
A magistrate in France has decided he should stand trial in the country.
Mr Bailey, who is originally from Manchester, has consistently denied involvement in the death of Ms Toscan du Plantier.
Her killing has become a notorious and protracted case of unsolved murder.
Mr Bailey, 59, was held twice over the killing but has never been prosecuted.
He tried to sue authorities in the Republic for wrongful arrest over the murder but lost his case in March last year.
He claimed in court that his life had been destroyed because police blamed him for a crime he did not commit.
In 2012, the Supreme Court in Dublin turned down an attempt by France to have him extradited.
After a long investigation, authorities in France now say he should face trial, although a date has yet to be set.
