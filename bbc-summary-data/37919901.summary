The 25-year-old Northern Ireland midfielder helped Thistle to two wins and two draws during the month.
England-born Barton, who has one cap, joined the Glasgow club this summer after leaving Portsmouth.
He followed up a fine October with a fine goal in a 2-1 defeat by Aberdeen at the start of November.
Barton started his career with Preston North End before spells with Crawley Town, Coventry City and Fleetwood Town.
