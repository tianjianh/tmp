[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number one Johanna Konta produced a superb battling display to reach the Miami Open semi-finals with victory over Romania's Simona Halep.

Tenth seed Konta gave up the only break of the first set but hit back to race into a 3-0 lead early in the second.
Third seed Halep recovered to force a tie-break but Konta dug deep to take it to a decider, which she won at a canter en route to a 3-6 7-6 (9-7) 6-2 win.
Konta now faces either Venus Williams or world number one Angelique Kerber.
The other semi-final will be between Caroline Wozniacki and Karolina Pliskova.
Halep, who saved a match point in her win over Sam Stosur in the previous round, edged an even first set thanks to a lone break of the Konta serve, but struggled at the start of the second as Konta took control.
The Briton was just a point away from opening a 4-0 lead but that was the cue for Halep to push again, claiming a vital hold and breaking in the next to get the set back on service.
"I went up to a 3-0 lead and had chances to go 4-0 up, but she's an incredible player and I knew it wouldn't be over until we shook hands," said Konta.
An unpredictable second set was decided in Konta's favour after a scrappy tie-break, after which a clearly rattled Halep was unable to find her rhythm as Konta eased away to victory in two and a half hours.
"I'm really happy to have come through and am looking forward to the next round," added Konta. "It's going to be a tough one."
In the men's event, Italy's Fabio Fognini beat second seed Kei Nishikori of Japan 6-4 6-2 to become the first unseeded player in 10 years to reach the semi-finals.
Fognini, 29, had beaten Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Feliciano Lopez to reach the last eight and will now play either Rafael Nadal and Jack Sock.
In the men's doubles, Britain's Jamie Murray and partner Bruno Soares bowed out at the quarter-final stage after a 2-6 6-3 10-8 loss to sixth seeds Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.
