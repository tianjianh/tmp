[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote in next May's Holyrood election have taken a step closer following backing from MSPs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A report by the Devolution Committee endorsed the change laid down in the Scottish Election (Reduction of Voting Age) Bill.
Last year's referendum saw those aged 16 and 17 being allowed to vote.
The committee report followed months of evidence gathering, including from young people themselves.
It is expected that the bill will be passed by Holyrood in time for the Scottish Parliament election.
The MSPs welcomed work being done by the Electoral Commission and others to raise teenagers' awareness of their rights and the process for registration and voting.
But it said that more action was needed to ensure that issues linked with elections were discussed in secondary schools.
The report said: "The committee believes that more should be done by Education Scotland, local authorities and the Electoral Commission to ensure that all local authorities across Scotland and the relevant education bodies are best supporting the discussion of election issues in schools and colleges."
In the aftermath of last year's independence referendum the committee had highlighted the need for national guidance to combat inconsistencies in schools about what issues could and could not be discussed.
Their report has now recommended Education Scotland reviews and updates its guidance "to ensure consistency in this area".
Committee convener Bruce Crawford said: "All parties represented on the committee and the parliament agree that 16 and 17-year-olds should be able to vote in future elections.
"The experience of last year's referendum - and the enthusiasm and engagement it generated - demonstrated that young people not only want a voice, they want a vote.
"In our evidence session we have heard from those involved in administering elections, in compiling registers and from representatives of young people, including young people themselves.
"While the committee believes that more needs to be done to ensure that schools and colleges are best supported to help discussion of election issues, we unanimously support the general principles of this Bill."
