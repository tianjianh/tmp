Channel 4 has told Noel Edmonds there will be no new deal for the studio version of game show Deal Or No Deal.

Edmonds has hosted the show, in which contestants open red boxes to win money, since 2005.
Channel 4 said the studio-based show will end this autumn but further episodes will be filmed on tour around the UK at the end of the year.
The broadcaster would not confirm whether the touring version would continue beyond that.
But Edmonds has been offered three new game shows on the channel.
One, with the working title Cheap Cheap Cheap, will be set in an "eccentric general store", with contestants asked to guess the cheapest of three items. Thirty episodes have been commissioned.
The other two shows have only been given pilot episodes at this stage. One has the working title Noel Edmonds' Sell or Swap and will see studio contestants bidding live on second-hand and antique items.
The other is simply billed as "a brand new studio-based big money game show".
When it launched, Deal Or No Deal was credited with reviving Edmonds' career and each episode was watched by three million people at its peak in 2006.
The show has given away more than Â£40m in prize money over almost 3,000 episodes, and the format has been sold to 76 countries.
Channel 4 chief creative officer Jay Hunt said: "I remember watching Deal or No Deal launch and watching it grow to become a hit that captivated audiences for over a decade.
"A lot of the credit for that must go to Noel and his exceptional presenting. As the studio shows ends, I'm delighted he'll now be taking Deal or No Deal to the audience."
