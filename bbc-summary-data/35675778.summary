[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The U's took the lead from a corner when Argyle defender Peter Hartley headed past his own keeper.
Plymouth quickly levelled when Curtis Nelson headed in a Jake Jervis corner.
The visitors led once more when Kemar Roofe rifled in his 21st of the season from 20 yards, before Argyle substitute Craig Tanner headed in from a corner to leave both sides with a point.
Plymouth also saw striker Reuben Reid crash a header off the crossbar early in the second half, before seeing his follow-up cleared off the line by Jonjoe Kenny.
Oxford also had a chance to win the game, but Nelson made a last-gasp tackle to deny Danny Hylton as he homed in on Luke McCormick's goal.
