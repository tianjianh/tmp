The Premiership champions began the defence of their title with a thumping 6-0 demolition of Ballymena United and travel to Taylor's Avenue on Wednesday.
"We lost at Carrick the last time we were there near the end of last season so we have to be careful," said Baxter.
"After that it's Linfield at home so it's a big week to open the season."

The Crues will again be without skipper Colin Coates, who serves the last of his two-game suspension, while Matthew Snoddy and Andy Mitchell are both recovering from injury.
"It was a pleasing opening day and our performance levels were high but we have to keep them high. It's still early days and we must continue in the vein we have started.
"We looked good pre-season and I enjoyed what I was seeing. We've worked hard in all the training sessions but it's about taking that onto the pitch on a consistent basis," added the Crues boss.
Last season's runners-up Linfield began their campaign with a 2-1 success over Ballinamallard and now entertain Oran Kearney's Coleraine, whose scheduled opening game against Portadown on Saturday was called off.
The south Belfast side won all four league encounters against the Bannisders last season.
Glenavon are another club with title aspirations and they will aim to build on their victory over Carrick when they face Ballymena at the Showgrounds.
"We are putting together a brand new side and it will take time. Wednesday's game offers a good opportunity for the players to respond to the defeat at Seaview," argued Ballymena boss David Jeffrey.
The Lurgan Blues are unbeaten in their last seven meetings with the Braidmen.
Belfast sides Cliftonville and Glentoran will hope to continue their winning starts to the season when they meet at Solitude, while Dungannon Swifts entertain newly-promoted Ards.
Portadown get their campaign underway by hosting Ballinamallard, whose manager Gavin Dykes was impressed by his side's display in the 2-1 reverse at the hands of the Blues at the weekend.
"I was disappointed with the result but thrilled with the performance against Linfield. We are undergoing a rebuilding process and hope to add another forward player to our squad before the end of the week.
The players are working hard and I'm pleased with their application and attitude," said Dykes.
There will be live coverage of Wednesday night's full programme of games on BBC Radio Ulster medium wave and the BBC Sport website from 19:30 BST.
