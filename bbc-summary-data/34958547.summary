Taylor, 26, hit 14 fours in her 110 from 106 balls, adding 181 with Bridget Patterson (74) as the Scorpions made 264-7 from their 50 overs.
England spinner Laura Marsh took 2-41 for NSW but was then out first ball.
The hosts, WNCL champions for the last 10 years, were bowled out for 210.
Taylor, who made history last month as the first woman to play Australian first-grade cricket, was named as player of the match.
She will now switch formats to line up for Adelaide Strikers in the inaugural Women's Big Bash League (WBBL), a Twenty20 tournament which will run alongside the men's Big Bash.
Eight current England players - Taylor, Katherine Brunt, Kate Cross, Charlotte Edwards, Heather Knight, Natalie Sciver, Lauren Winfield and Danielle Wyatt - are signed up for the WBBL, as is ex-England all-rounder Nicky Shaw.
The WBBL begins next Saturday, 5 December with Cross and Winfield's Brisbane Heat side taking on Sciver's Melbourne Stars.
