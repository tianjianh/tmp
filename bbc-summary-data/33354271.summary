Danny Blind has been appointed as the new Netherlands head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 53-year old succeeds Guus Hiddink, who left his position on Monday after just 10 months in charge.
Blind, who was Hiddink's assistant, won 42 caps during a 20-year playing career with Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam, and also managed Ajax.
Hiddink, 68, lost five and won four of his 10 matches during his second spell in charge, with the Dutch third in their Euro 2016 qualifying group.
He apologised for leaving the national side five points behind leaders Iceland and three adrift of the Czech Republic in Group A.
