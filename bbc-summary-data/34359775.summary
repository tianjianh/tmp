Scores of cannabis plants have been discovered growing in a remote area of disused land in south-west London.

Police found the cannabis patch, covering an area the size of a football pitch, after a call from a member of the public in Kingston.
They found more than 150 plants, some more than 5ft (1.5m) tall. The plants are to be destroyed.
PC Sarah Henderson said it looked like "a small forest of Christmas trees and was complete with a gazebo".
The plants were found near Lower Marsh Lane.
"Whoever set this up used a really remote spot - the only way to get there was a 20-minute walk through wasteland.
"But all their time, trouble and gardening skills will go unrewarded, as the whole lot will now be destroyed by police," she said.
There have been no arrests and inquiries continue, the police said.
