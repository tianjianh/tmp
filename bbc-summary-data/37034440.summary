Head coach Paul Trollope says every player at Cardiff City "has their price," before the transfer window closes.

Defender Fabio Da Silva is closing in on a Premier League return with promoted Middlesbrough.
He could be followed out of the exit door if acceptable bids are made.
"We don't want to lose anyone in the group, but [at] any club apart from the top ones, every player has their price and you have buy-out clauses," he said.
"In terms of players going, the Fabio one has been well-documented but nothing has changed on that, it is an ongoing process.
"Obviously there are a few players at the club we are willing to listen to offers for and that won't change between now and the end of the window.
"We talk about it as a club, as a head coach I get a very big say in that, but like any club, players have their prices and if clubs reach that price and turn the players' head, it is very difficult.
"If players have high offers, obviously you listen to those offers."
Trollope, who has left the Welsh coaching set-up to focus on his managerial career, says he has spoken with defender Jazz Richards.
Richards, formerly a Swansea player, was booed by Cardiff supporters in their season opener at Birmingham for his apparent reluctance to 'do the Ayattolah' - a cult Cardiff celebration which involved tapping your head with both hands.
Cardiff even went to the lengths of releasing footage that showed Richards did do the celebration at St Andrews.
Trollope told BBC Radio Wales Sport that he does expect Richards to "respect the club's traditions."
"I spoke to Jazz, he is aware of the club's traditions and obligations and it is something that happened during the game that I was not aware of," Trollope explained.
"We have got evidence and he assures us that he did it, which I think some of the supporters saw.
"But moving forward I don't think it will be a problem.
"He performed at a good level for us on Saturday, we were pleased with his contribution, but we don't need these things going on around it.
"He's aware of our expectations. He was focused on the game and he did it, that's the main thing and it is a learning curve for him for the next games as to what he should be doing."
Cardiff travel to Trollope's former club Bristol Rovers tomorrow night for a clash in the first round of the EFL Cup.
