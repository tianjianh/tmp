Dai Young: Wasps director of rugby has 'two number one scrum-halves'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young says he is looking forward to seeing how the battle between the club's two senior scrum-halves, Dan Robson and Joe Simpson, develops in the future.

Simpson, 27, started the season as first choice but 24-year-old Robson has started the past nine games after Simpson injured his ankle in January.
Robson scored two tries on Sunday as Wasps won 34-20 at Newcastle.
"I think Dan's been outstanding," Young told BBC Coventry and Warwickshire.
"I don't think he's grabbed as many headlines as some others this season, but he's been excellent for us."
Robson, an England Saxon international, joined Wasps from Gloucester last summer and has scored five tries since Simpson, who has one full England cap, has been unavailable after damaging his ankle in Champions Cup action against Leinster.
"We haven't got a number one and number two scrum-half, we've got two number ones," added Young.
"One's going to have to hold a chair for a while and the other's going to keep pressure on him. I'm sure that'll ebb and flow throughout the next few seasons."
Wasps have won eight of their past nine Premiership games, including three in succession, and sit in third place, one point behind Exeter Chiefs.
They are also seven clear of Northampton Saints, who they play at home on Sunday, in the final play-off place.
"It's a nice place to be," Young said. "We're well in contention to finish in the top six - we'd have to have a disaster for us not to there now. The top four is there as well for us to have a crack at.
"Northampton is a real shoot-out for us - we're in a great position."
