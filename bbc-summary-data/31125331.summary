It means patients, visitors and staff will not be allowed to smoke in any of its buildings and grounds.
The trust said smokers would be given help to stop and patients could be prescribed nicotine patches during their stay.
The ban is being brought in at its clinics, community hospitals and health centres from 2 March.
Stuart Bell, chief executive of the trust, said: "As a healthcare provider we have a duty to provide a setting that promotes good health and we didn't feel the current policy around smoking was in keeping with this philosophy."
The Headington-based trust runs eight community hospitals in Oxfordshire.
It also provides specialised services including mental health and eating disorder treatments across Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Swindon and Bath and North East Somerset.
