The project, called Historical Dances in an Antique Setting, is the work of Argentine artist Pablo Bronstein.
Three classically-trained dancers will be seen weaving up and down the Duveen Galleries "striking elegant and refined poses".
The free installation opens on Tuesday with live performances from 1100-1700. It runs until 9 October.
Bronstein's work also features two large-scale architectural structures which are overlaid with images of Tate Britain's exterior architecture.
The effect is described as "visually turning the gallery inside out".
"Grand architecture is one of the things I'm most interested in, so it was a rare opportunity to be able to create work in such a unique setting as the Duveen Galleries," Bronstein said.
"The commission also presented a perfect and challenging opportunity to work with performance on a large scale."
Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said: "Pablo Bronstein's work consistently makes for deliciously jarring encounters between past and present, and between art and society. It's fantastic to see his work come to life in the aesthetic and institutional grandeur of Tate Britain's Duveen Galleries."
