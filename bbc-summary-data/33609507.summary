Police water cannon faults all addressed, Met chief says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dozens of problems with police water cannon use cited by the home secretary have been addressed, the Metropolitan Police commissioner has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Theresa May recently announced her decision not to allow police to use them and said 67 faults had been identified with the way they operated.
Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe told a meeting at London's City Hall: "We believe we've addressed all of them."
Mrs May also raised concerns about the impact on public trust in the police.
The home secretary's ruling, which applies across England and Wales, comes a year after three of them were bought by the Metropolitan Police at a total cost of Â£328,883.
The issues she highlighted included improving the effectiveness of water jets, ensuring the public address system was audible, replacing a defective water pressure sensor and the need for training to use the equipment in poor light.
London Mayor Boris Johnson, who was also at the meeting, commented: "They sound like pretty trivial problems to me."
Sir Bernard described them as "snagging" issues.
He said: "We do think that those were less of an issue than obviously some fundamental things that the government wanted to consider."
When she made her decision, Mrs May said water cannon could cause serious injuries and that authorising their use would place at risk the historic principle of policing by consent.
Mr Johnson previously said the Met Police would continue to train on the three water cannon bought last year.
Water cannon are used in Northern Ireland, but have never been deployed in the rest of the UK.
