John Lewis, from Virginia, has been responding to tweets sent to his handle @johnlewis following the release of the store's 2016 festive advert.
He was sent a cushion personalised with the message: "Merry Christmas @johnlewis 'not a retail store'".
John Lewis the store said it was a thank you for fielding wayward tweets.
Mr Lewis has suffered the same festive problem for at least the last two years.
He was inundated with messages following the release of the John Lewis Christmas advert - starring Buster the boxer dog - on Thursday.
He replied to his correspondents with witty messages which include the retail store's actual Twitter handle @johnlewisretail.
One user Marsha wrote: "Ahh wow @johnlewis has done it again. Festive brilliance. #bustertheboxer  #JohnLewisAdvert #TheMagicOfChristmas."
Mr Lewis replied: "While I am both brilliant and festive, I have done it exactly zero times. @johnlewisretail."
Michael Kelly tweeted Mr Lewis to ask whether the dog in the advert was available in the store or online, adding: "My lad wants one and Xmas is gonna be insufferable if I can't get it!"
He responded by saying: "My dog is a Shepard named Sandy, not a Boxer named Buster. You probably want to check with @johnlewisretail."
John Lewis said it sends Mr Lewis a Christmas gift for his efforts in directing the mistaken tweets to the correct handle.
He posted a picture of his latest present package on Twitter which also included a cuddly toy Buster, personalised wrapping paper and Christmas crackers.
A John Lewis retail spokeswoman said: "This is our busiest time of the year and we know that although he's not a retail store it can be busy for John too.
"We hope he can take a little time out to enjoy these gifts as much as we enjoy his tweets."
