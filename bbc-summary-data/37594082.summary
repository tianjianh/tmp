[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 1-4 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter came from behind to thrash Barnet and condemn them to a sixth straight game without a win in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bees were an obvious threat from set pieces and John Akinde gave the home side a 12th-minute lead with a thumping header from Ryan Watson's corner.
But Jake Taylor fired in a terrific shot from 25 yards which arrowed into Jamie Stephens' top corner to draw Exeter level in the 43rd minute.
And they were ahead almost immediately after the break, Reuben Reid's clever back-heeled pass finding Lee Holmes to finish.
The home side looked stunned and the Grecians added a third six minutes later when Stephens spilled an Ollie Watkins shot and David Wheeler followed up to score.
Barnet almost pulled one back with 20 minutes remaining, but substitute Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro saw his shot cleared off the line by Watkins.
And their fate was sealed by Reid's 81st-minute penalty after Mauro Vilhete tripped Taylor in the corner of the box.
