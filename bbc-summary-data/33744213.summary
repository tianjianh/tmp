Camps slotted home after Donal McDermott's pass fell to him to open the scoring early on.
Peterborough's best chances came before the break when Jon Taylor and Joe Gormley both tested the goalkeeper.
Dale secured the win when striker Ian Henderson found Reuben Noble-Lazarus who fired home as they beat the Posh for the first time since 2006.

"It's not a one game season by any stretch of the imagination and you don't know what to expect, but we've been preparing to play like that.
"I was pretty relaxed because I've got used to the fact it's a 46-game season no matter what happens on the first game.
"I'm really pleased with the performance but I'm really pleased with the lads, the fact that they're taking ownership of it now - I've got to trust my future in these players."
