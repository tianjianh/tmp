Marcus Bignot: Solihull Moors manager keen to sign contract at Damson Park

Marcus Bignot, the manager with no contract at National League part-timers Solihull Moors, says he is now ready to sign his first deal at Damson Park.

The ex-Crewe, Bristol Rovers and QPR right-back, who led the Moors into the fifth tier of English football for the first time in April, has worked without a contract in six years at Damson Park.
But he is now finally ready to put his loyalty to the club in writing.
"I've always done it the old school way," Bignot told BBC Sport.
"The first agent I had was a big agency. The second was Eric Hall and that was all done on a handshake. I never signed anything. A handshake was as good as anything written down.
"I've never had a contract here. But they now know I'm loyal. I want to manage higher up one day, but I want to do it the right way."
Now, with the appointment of former Swindon Town chairman Jed McCrory to the Solihull board and the club's plans to further expand their off-field operation, Bignot feels the time is right to secure his immediate future.
"I must be the only manager in this league that's not got a contract," he added. "It's unsettling. The way the club is changing off the pitch I feel it's only right I have some security."
Ahead of Saturday's trip to Maidstone, Solihull are currently 17th in their first season in the National League, three points clear of the relegation places.
After winning three of their first five games, the Moors then shipped 14 goals in losing their next four matches.
Three successive draws have steadied the ship, but last week's early second-half strike by Jamie Osborne in the 1-1 home draw with Boreham Wood was their first goal in three games.
