The event, which happens on the Isle of Wight in the UK, will stage a two-day festival at the Canadian city's Hanlan's Point Beach.
It'll take place on the weekend of 12-13 June on the shore of Lake Ontario.
"We have waited 12 years to decide to launch another Bestival outside the UK," said organiser and Radio 1 DJ, Rob da Bank.
"Our beloved Besitval has grown into one of the most important festivals in the global calendar.
"It took a really special city, and an even more exciting site, with Toronto and Toronto Island, to make us take the leap.
"So, the waiting is over and we are so excited to be launching in North America in June, with a classic Bestival line-up waiting to thrill, intrigue and party.
"We cannot wait."
No acts have been announced yet.
Bestival was launched in 2004 and is now held over four days in Robin Hill Country Park.
The Chemical Brothers, Underworld and The Jacksons are among the first acts to be announced for this year's festival, which takes place between 10-13 September.
Its theme is "Summer of Love" - with festival goers encouraged to wear fancy dress to match.
Sister event, Camp Bestival, takes place at Lulworth Castle in Dorset on 30 July until 2 August and has run each year since 2008.
Underworld are also headlining that event - alongside Clean Bandit and Kaiser Chiefs.
