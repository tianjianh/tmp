Gloucestershire batsman Michael Klinger says he has still not given up hope of playing for Australia - even though he is 35.

Klinger has been in stunning form for Gloucestershire this season helping them reach the One-Day Cup final.
This comes off the back of a fine season in Australia, but he continues to be overlooked by selectors.
"What I've done over the past 18 months is over and above anybody else," Klinger told BBC Points West.
Klinger, who fired an unbeaten 137 in Gloucestershire's One-Day cup semi-final win over Yorkshire, added: "I try my best to keep putting some pressure on. That's what they've asked me to do when I've spoken to them in past.

"If I keep doing that then I am confident that one day I might get a positive phone call from the chief selector Rod Marsh."
Melbourne-born Klinger admits time is against him, but hopes the forthcoming series against Bangladesh could see him given a chance.
"You always hold out a bit of hope," he said.
"There is still the Bangladesh Test series coming up and I think they need to replace three players so if they take my form in Australia - 1000 runs last year -  hopefully it'll fall my way some time.
"I know if someone else is doing the same that I'm doing but they are 26, then they will go for them. But Chris Rogers showed the way by coming in at 35 and having two strong years helping the team forward."
Klinger. who will captain Gloucestershire in the One-Day Cup final against Surrey at Lord's on September 19, says he could play for Australia in either format, which acts as further motivation.
"Whether it's a Baggy Green or a shorter format, going forward it keeps me playing well and with desire."
