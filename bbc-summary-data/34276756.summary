[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ian Hopkins is new chief constable for Greater Manchester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Hopkins has been appointed the new chief constable for Greater Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Currently GMP's deputy chief constable, he succeeds Sir Peter Fahy who announced his retirement in July after seven years in the role.
Mr Hopkins said he was looking forward to building on the "excellent work" done by his predecessor.
He has been with Greater Manchester Police (GMP) since 2008 following roles with Staffordshire, Northamptonshire and Cheshire Police.
Mr Hopkins was named as the preferred candidate by Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner and Interim Mayor Tony Lloyd.

Considered to be one of the top five jobs in UK policing, the new chief constable will have his work cut out from day one.
One hundred million pounds has been slashed from the force budget since 2010 along with more than 1,000 officers and as many civilian staff. It's feared planned reforms of the way the police are funded could disproportionately affect big city forces such as GMP, cutting a further £75m.
So these are challenging times and that's even before you consider increased workloads in areas such as investigations into alleged historic abuse.
It's a big job with huge pressure as indicated by the fact that only two people wanted it, despite its £185,000 salary.
By appointing 'in-house', Police and Crime Commissioner Tony Lloyd has gone for someone who already knows the force and many of its officers.
A recent survey by the local Police Federation found morale among rank-and-file officers is poor and they've already expressed the hope that Mr Hopkins will make efforts to turn that around.
Mr Lloyd said: "Ian is a highly regarded figure in British policing and has extensive experience of the challenges of policing Greater Manchester.
"I'm confident that Ian is the person to lead GMP and work with me to build safer, stronger communities."
Mr Hopkins beat the chief constable of Cheshire Police, Simon Byrne, to the position.
His appointment is expected to be rubber-stamped at a meeting of the Police and Crime Panel next week.
Sir Peter was appointed chief constable of GMP - one of the largest police forces in the UK - in 2008 and is paid a £193,000 annual salary.
His time in office included the 2012 murders of policewomen Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone by Dale Cregan, and the mass poisoning of patients at Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport by nurse Victorino Chua.
After stepping down, he will become chief executive of the children's charity Retrak.
