Further fall in the number of crimes recorded in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crime has fallen again in Scotland, according to official figures.

In the year to the end of March 2015 there was a fall of 5% in the number of crimes recorded by Police Scotland.
The total of 256,350 recorded crimes is the lowest since 1974 but sexual crimes were up by 11%, to their highest level since 1971.
More than half of the overall decrease was down to a sharp reduction in the number of thefts and vandalism reported to police.
The largest fall was recorded in Moray where there was a drop of 18%.
In Aberdeenshire and Highland, the overall decrease was 17%.
The number of crimes reported in Shetland was about the same as in the previous 12 months - one of five council areas where the figures were static.
Police said the increase in the number of sexual crimes recorded was partly due to increased confidence of victims to report offences, a change in the definition of some sexual crimes and a rising number of historic allegations.
Other figures:
East Lothian was the only local authority that recorded an increase (6%) in attempted murders and serious assaults over the past 10 years.
In the same 10-year period there has been a 50% decrease in homicide in Glasgow City.
Crimes of handling an offensive weapon decreased by 67% since 2006-07 when these crimes were at the highest level since 1971.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: "Recorded crime has fallen for the eighth year in a row and is now at its lowest level for 41 years, violent crime is down 6% and crimes of handling an offensive weapon (including knives) have reduced by 67% since 2006-07.
"These strong statistics are backed by over 1,000 extra police officers since 2007, protecting the public and keeping communities safe.
"The falling figures around violent crime are especially encouraging and are testament to increased policing and to the huge amount of groundbreaking work being done by the Violence Reduction Unit and the Scottish government's No Knives, Better Lives programme amongst others to educate our young people about the dangers and consequences of becoming involved in any form of violence."
Police Scotland's Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick said: "Local policing remains at the heart of our service and the decreases in crimes of violence, including attempted murders and serious assaults, dishonesty and anti-social behaviour - issues which communities tell us are amongst their greatest concerns - are very welcome."
Karyn McCluskey, director of the Violence Reduction Unit, said: "Reducing violence is a complex challenge. The Violence Reduction Unit has always been clear that long-term planning is crucial to making Scotland one of the safest countries in the world.
"Nevertheless, we cannot be complacent and there cannot be any diminution of our efforts."
Scottish Conservative justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell said: "It's all very well to say these figures are the lowest in 40 years, but that fall is based on data that does not include 'offences' such as stalking.
"That's not an honest approach at all, and when you see an increase in sex crimes, it illustrates just how important it is these numbers stand up to scrutiny.
"Police Scotland also has work to do when it comes to the clear-up rate, particularly considering such varying results depending on where people live."
Liberal Democrat justice spokeswoman Alison McInnes said: "I'm concerned that the fall in clear up rates reveals the real impact of backfilling.
"We need a wide inquiry into the operations of Police Scotland to give officers and communities confidence that lessons are being learnt.
"It would be reckless of SNP ministers to allow the clear-up rate to continue to slip without any examination as to why."
