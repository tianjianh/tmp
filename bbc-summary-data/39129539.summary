Kevin Nolan: Notts County's revival down to intelligent players

Manager Kevin Nolan says Notts County's remarkable revival is down to having intelligent players who learn quickly.

The Magpies had lost 10 League Two games in a row when Nolan was appointed on 12 January and were just one point and one place above the bottom two.
But the win at second-placed Plymouth Argyle was their fourth in nine games under Nolan and took them eight points clear of the relegation zone.
"This is not a time to relax now," Nolan told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"This is the time to work even harder and that is what we are going to do. We will continue to do that because that's what we are doing behind the scenes as a backroom staff."
The victory over Argyle was achieved thanks to Jorge Grant - one of four players who moved to the Meadow Lane club towards the end of the January transfer window.
Former Newcastle and West Ham midfielder Nolan also registered as a player but is yet to feature, while experienced striker Shola Ameobi has recently signed.
Four games into his tenure, Nolan insisted that they were not in a relegation battle, despite at that time being in an identical position to when he took charge.
He added: "I didn't know the players personally, but once I got to know them I knew I had intelligent footballers, who could handle what I would throw at them.
"They have done that tremendously and they keep working hard."
The 34-year-old said he and chairman Alan Hardy both shared the same "110% work ethic", adding: "The lads know that and it's brilliant they have brought into it and are getting the results because of it."
