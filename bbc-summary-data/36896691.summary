EU referendum: Man cautioned for illegally voting in Powys

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has been given a police caution for illegally voting in the EU referendum at a Powys polling station.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, who has not been named, committed an offence of personation under election legislation when he pretended to be someone else to cast their vote.
Polling station staff knew the real person and recognised he was an imposter.
They reported the matter to Dyfed-Powys Police.
Det Con Robert Seymour, of the force's fraud team, said: "Members of the public must be aware that it is illegal to vote by pretending to be someone else, even if they've been asked to do it as a favour by the person they are pretending to be.
"Voters can always vote by proxy, which is different to the actions taken by the male on this occasion".
