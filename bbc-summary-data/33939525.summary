A section of the East Yorkshire coastline is beginning to collapse after a large crack appeared in the cliffs at Mappleton beach.

A cordon has been put in place around the 50m crack, which was spotted on Wednesday, and people have been warned to avoid the cliff top.
Geologists described it as a "landslip in action" and said the cliff was "continuously slipping".
The council said "about 2,000 cubic metres" were in the process of falling.
Coastguard rescue officer and geologist Daniel Escreet said: "It's a huge danger. It's continuously slipping, it's a landslip in action.
"It'll be moving very slowly at the moment. But it could move very quickly at any time."
Michael Ball, the council's principal engineer, said: "It's the fastest eroding coastline in Europe.
"We've seen a large crack develop and the cliff is unstable.
"We've taken measures to make the area safe. We've put up fencing today. It's very likely it's going to give away soon... the next few tides could bring it down.
"People have to be aware that it's a dangerous situation to be standing too close to the cliff edge and getting too close to the base of the cliff, because material can fall down at anytime."
