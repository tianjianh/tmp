[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scottish League Cup: St Johnstone 3-0 Falkirk

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two Danny Swanson penalties in a remarkable first half helped St Johnstone to victory over Falkirk.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side were awarded three spot kicks in that first period, the first of which from Liam Craig was saved by Danny Rogers.
But Swanson was more clinical as Tommy Wright's side made it two wins from two in the League Cup, leaving Falkirk with just three points from three games.
Joe Shaughnessy scored from close range in the second half to kill Falkirk off.
The visiting side were stunned by referee Bobby Madden's decision to award Saints those three crucial first-half decisions, venting their anger at half-time.
There was little doubt about the first award as Swanson was brought down by Tom Taiwo just inside the penalty area.
But Rogers guessed correctly and pushed Craig's tamely-hit effort away to his right.
Paul Watson was then penalised for grappling with Shaughnessy as a Craig corner was swept into the box and this time Swanson took responsibility.
Rogers was a little unfortunate not to make a second stop as he got a hand to Swanson's shot, but it had too much power and Saints had a deserved lead.
Falkirk's bemusement turned to fury when Madden pointed to the spot again seven minutes before the break, with Luke Leahy pulling the jersey of Graham Cummins.
Swanson gave the keeper no chance on this occasion as he hammered the ball to his right and into the net.
Falkirk had new signing John Rankin in their midfield and he unleashed a trademark long-range strike, which brought Alan Mannus into action for the first time, the keeper tipping the ball round the post.
And Shaughnessy ensured there would be no way back for Peter Houston's team when he tapped over the line from a yard out after Cummins had headed goalwards.
