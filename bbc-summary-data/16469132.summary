Northampton Saints full-back Ben Foden believes his rivalry with Harlequins' Mike Brown can benefit both players and England.

Foden, 26, scored his third try in two matches as Saints beat Quins 24-3 in the Aviva Premiership.
But he told BBC Radio Northampton: "If he continues to perform, I'm going to have to push myself to the limit.
"Hopefully it'll bring out the best in both of us and put England rugby in a good place."
Interim England coach Stuart Lancaster will name his squad for the Six Nations on Wednesday, with Brown expected to return for the first time since the tour of New Zealand in 2008.
Also 26, he has scored 10 tries in 17 starts for Quins to help them reach the top of the Premiership table.
Meanwhile, Foden is hopeful that Saints will again contribute a good number of players to the England squad for next month's tournament, after he joined Tom Wood, Chris Ashton, Courtney Lawes and Dylan Hartley at the 2011 World Cup.
"We're performing well and if guys are fit, hopefully we'll see a few more representing the green, black and gold," he added.
