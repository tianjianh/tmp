Kent's police commissioner has scrapped her youth commissioner role, blaming media attention.

Ann Barnes created the job to represent the views of young people on policing.
The first youth commissioner, Paris Brown, resigned over comments she made on Twitter.
The second, Kerry Boyd, was investigated over claims she had a relationship with an ex-councillor and her referee for the Â£15,000-a-year role.
Ms Barnes said she could not put another young person through the pressure of the role.
She said a youth advisory group would replace it.
Speaking in front of the Kent and Medway crime panel, she said: "The demands placed on one young person, I cannot justify anymore.
"Even though I do think a youth commissioner was a good concept and she [Kerry Boyd] did a good piece of work."
Mike Hill, who is the chairman of the crime panel, which holds Ms Barnes to account, said he was pleased the role had been scrapped.
