The 20-year-old withdrew after facing 23 balls and will undergo a scan.
"Hameed has retired hurt with Lancashire 17-0," the Red Rose outfit posted on social media.
Hameed made his England debut in India last year and scored 219 runs in three Tests before a finger injury forced him out of the final match of the series.
He missed the Champion County match in Abu Dhabi in March following sinus surgery.
