The 53-year-old, who signed a three-year deal as Rangers boss in May after a spell in caretaker charge, leaves a day after a 1-0 defeat by Derby left the team 13th in the Championship.
Rangers director of football Les Ferdinand said the move was made in the "best interests of the club".
Former boss Neil Warnock, who has been acting as an adviser at Loftus Road, has been placed in temporary charge.
A statement on the club's website added they would begin "an immediate recruitment process" to find Ramsey's successor.
Rangers are attempting to return to the Premier League at the first attempt following their relegation in May.
Ferdinand said Ramsey had fallen short of expectations, which were increased by the club keeping hold of "key players" in the summer.
"Keeping these players at the club has seen the mandate change, owing to what we believe this squad is capable of," he added.
"We're all desperately disappointed it hasn't worked out with Chris. He has had to deal with this shift in expectation and has worked incredibly hard in doing so."
During the summer, the club expected striker Charlie Austin and midfielders Leroy Fer and Sandro to leave.
Just hours before he was sacked Ramsey, who made 11 permanent signings in the summer, had said he faced a "massive challenge".
He was the second Championship manager to lose his job on Wednesday after Huddersfield sacked Chris Powell.
