[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford University college squatter legal action adjourned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legal action to remove squatters from a building in Oxford has been adjourned for seven days.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Campaigners had asked that the former car showroom, which is owned by Oxford University's Wadham College, be designated as homeless housing.
Midcounties Cooperative holds the lease for the ground floor of the Iffley Road property and has applied to Oxford County Court for a repossession order.
But it has now asked for seven days to try to reach an agreement.
In a statement the Co-op said the adjournment was to give "time to continue to work towards a collaborative outcome".
Elise Benjamin, from campaign group Iffley Open House, said the adjournment had given them "a bit of a breather".
She said: "Our aim is to negotiate with the Co-op to find some sort of solution that will keep people housed."
The site, which the college hopes to redevelop into student accommodation, is currently home to 14 people and has been vacant for two years.
Campaigners took over the site on New Year's Eve have asked for the site to be officially designated as homeless housing.
On Monday, Lewis Cairns, who is homeless and living in the squat, described it as a "godsend".
