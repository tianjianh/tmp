Ben Ashworth, 35, from Preston, finished his last race in Berlin.
He started his charity runs in April in Blackpool before running marathons in Windermere, Wakefield, Northampton and the Isle of Man while undergoing chemotherapy.
Mr Ashworth said he was "tremendously happy" to complete the feat and raise more than Â£15,000 for charity.
He finished the Berlin race in four hours 56 minutes, three minutes over his personal best in Ramsey, Isle of Man.
He said: "I really wanted to beat my [personal best] in my last marathon but I'm tremendously happy to have run six and raised so much money."
The former librarian who has three daughters, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2012.
Before he became ill he had run the Great North Run, a half-marathon, but said it was his dream to conquer a full marathon.
Earlier this year he decided to set himself the "massive challenge" of running six.
Mr Ashworth said his treatment has made it "very hard at times".
"My preparations for most of the marathons have been less than ideal, but I've not been able to wipe the smile off my face when I've lined up at the start line," he said.
"When I signed up to run the Berlin marathon I didn't know if I would be well enough. I'm so lucky to be able to say I've [done it]."
