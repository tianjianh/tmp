He won 26 of the 48 votes cast to clinch victory in the first round.
The elections were organised by Fifa's Normalisation Committee, who had been put in place to manage the Togo FA's affairs after an internal crisis.
Akpovy's major tasks are to streamline the country's football administration and restart the domestic league.
He said: "I will turn the fortunes of Togo's football.  I am going to make sure that we start the league by 15 May 2016 because we need young talented players to fill up our national teams."
Togo play Tunisia home and away in Match as part of the qualifiers for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.
