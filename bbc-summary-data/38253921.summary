A soap cop turned beauty queen has said burglars who stole three pageant crowns in a raid on her home have left her and her family devastated.

Robyn Morrison, a real life police officer in Australia before playing Terri Hall in Neighbours in 2002, was burgled early on Wednesday evening.
She said the crowns were not of enormous value, but "were irreplaceable".
Mrs Morrison said the gang also stole electrical items and pageant jewellery.
Two of the crowns taken were won by her daughter Halle-Blu Morrison, 12, who became the first British contestant to be crowned junior Miss Galaxy International, in Florida, in August.
This followed her success in junior Miss Galaxy UK.
Mrs Morrison, who was crowned Mrs Europe Galaxy at the same event, said her daughter's crowns were irreplaceable - and has posted pictures on social media to alert anyone who may be offered the items, or sees them for sale online.
She said the gang - who were caught on CCTV at the family home in the Bradford area - had possibly been looking for a safe, as they had "trashed the house and smashed everything".
Before appearing in Neighbours, Mrs Morrison worked undercover for the police in Sydney.
During that time she dealt with victims of burglary, and said she now knows exactly how bad it feels.
An iPad, Xbox and laptop were also stolen, along with other items of pageant jewellery.
Mrs Morrison - who went by her maiden name Robyn Charlesworth when she appeared in Neighbours - is married to Dewsbury Rams head coach Glenn Morrison.
Anyone with information about the raid is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police, which said it was investigating the burglary.
