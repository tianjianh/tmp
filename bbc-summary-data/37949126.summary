About 20 homes in the Westland Street area were evacuated for four hours following the discovery of a suspicious object at 20:45 GMT.
Army bomb experts were called to the scene and the object was taken away for forensic examination.
It was later declared to be a viable pipe bomb device.
Ch Insp Gordon McCalmont said the security alert caused "considerable disruption to a large amount of local residents".
"I would like to thank those people affected for their support and patience while we dealt with this viable device to make the area safe."
Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in councillor Colly Kelly said the device was discovered by a dog walker and found near a youth club that was packed with children at the time.
He described the incident as "disgusting" and said the local community had been left angered by the disruption.
Mr Kelly said whoever was responsible do not "represent the people of Derry".
