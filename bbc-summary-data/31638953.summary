FM Group is behind the application for the Ury Estate development, near Stonehaven.
The "world class" course is backed by American multiple Major winning golfing legend Jack Nicklaus.
The plan is for the restoration and conversion of Ury Mansion House into a hotel and clubhouse, and dozens of homes.
Jonathon Milne, director of FM Group, said: "This much-anticipated and highly welcomed golf development stalled during the recession but is now fully back on track and, if it proceeds, will really put Stonehaven on the map, attracting tourists and boosting business in the town."
He said an independent report showed the proposed championship golf course and associated housing development could generate £55.5m into the Aberdeenshire economy over a 15-year period and create 200 new jobs.
Jack Nicklaus said: "Aberdeenshire is a beautiful area and this site is particularly special.
"I have visited on a number of occasions, and I think Ury Estate provides us all the components to create a memorable golf experience."
