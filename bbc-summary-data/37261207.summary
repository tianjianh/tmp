The former Everton and Manchester City midfielder died after being hit by a train at West Allerton station in Merseyside. The death is not being treated as suspicious.
To honour Tynan, a minute's applause is also being held at Women's Super League and Women's Premier League matches.
The Football Association said it was "deeply saddened" by the death.
WPL Northern Division side Fylde said on Twitter that they were retiring Tynan's shirt in her "loving memory".
"We want to remember Zoe in the best possible way: a hugely talented player and an immensely likable character," Fylde manager Luke Swindlehurst said.
Tynan played for England at various youth levels and was recently included in the under-19 squad for a training camp at St George's Park.
