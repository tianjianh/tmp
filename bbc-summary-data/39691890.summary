The violence raised the death toll to 23 in three weeks of protests.
Ombudsman Tarek Saab said several others were seriously injured and "between life and death".
The latest protests were sparked by the decision by the Supreme Court to take over the powers of the opposition-dominated National Assembly.
The court's reversal of the ruling was not enough to stop a wave of demonstrations.
On Monday a man was shot dead in a pro-government demonstration in the city of Merida and another man was killed in the nearby town of Barinas.
Merida state Governor Henrique Capriles, one of Venezuela's main opposition leaders, tweeted that "paramilitary groups" were responsible for the killings.
12 people have been killed in pro- and anti-government demonstrations this month so far.
Another 11 people died on Friday when a bakery was looted in Caracas.
What is behind the crisis in Venezuela?
There have been anti-government protests across cities in Venezuela almost daily this month, while government supporters have been holding marches to show their loyalty to President Maduro.
Both government and opposition supporters as well as bystanders have been killed.
There is little sign of the protests subsiding as the opposition has vowed to "stay on the streets" until presidential elections due to be held at the end of 2018 are brought forward.
Vatican-backed talks held late last year failed to yield any notable agreements and ended after the opposition accused the government of intransigence.
Opposition groups have called on their supporters to hold sit-ins across Venezuela on Monday in a continuation of their protests.
