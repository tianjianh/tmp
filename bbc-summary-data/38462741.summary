An opponent has yet to be named for the fight at the Titanic Exhibition Centre, where Conlan defeated Hungarian David Koos on points last month.
Conlan remains undefeated with 11 knock-outs in 18 victories.
"He has a style and determination that never fails to excite," said promoter Frank Warren.
"Belfast is a proud boxing city which always generates an incredible atmosphere at every event.
"The recent 'Homecoming' event on 5 November at the Titanic Exhibition Centre showcased the strength and depth of talent in Irish boxing and I believe we are coming into a golden era with Jamie right at the forefront.
"The atmosphere his fans produce is special and that's why I will do everything possible to make sure we secure Jamie his world title chance in Belfast in 2017."
