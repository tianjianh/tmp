[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ulster suffer Louis Ludik and Darren Cave injury setback

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster pair Louis Ludik and Darren Cave face spells on the sidelines after picking up injures in Friday's Pro12 defeat by Connacht in Galway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ludik is out for four-six weeks with a fractured cheekbone and Cave could miss four weeks because of a calf tear.
However, Charles Piutau is among six players set to return for the European Champions Cup opener against Bordeaux.
Stuart Olding, Luke Marshall, Andrew Trimble, Franco van der Merwe and Dan Tuohy are also expected back.
Having Piutau, Marshall (both concussion), Trimble (toe), van der Merwe, Tuohy (both ankle) and Olding (right adductor) available after injury would be a major boost for Kiss ahead of Sunday's trip to France.
Utility back Ludik and centre Cave were both forced off as Ulster suffered their first Pro12 loss of the campaign.
Ulster remain top of the Pro12 standings although just one point separates the top four.
