Sinitta on Zayn Malik quitting the tour: It's burn out

You often see her wearing unusual outfits at Simon Cowell's pad during judges houses on X Factor.

But it seems Sinitta has a good idea why Zayn Malik had to pull out of the One Direction tour.
In a statement the band said he'd been "signed off with stress", and Simon Cowell's wing lady thinks that's down to their punishing schedule.
Sinitta reckons it's "burn out", and that the singer could probably do with a few decent nights of sleep.
"I know their schedule has just been non-stop ever since they left the show (X Factor)."
Unfortunately for Zayn, taking a few days off is often all that's needed to spark rumours that he's leaving the band.
"Nothing like that's been announced," said Sinitta.
"Let's just see what happens.
"When we don't see them here, it's not that they're resting, it's that they're in another country.
"They're literally promoting their records non-stop around the world, so they don't get a lot of downtime."
The X Factor judge was also keen to dismiss claims Simon Cowell's record label Syco had been pushing the boy band too hard.
"They are hungry, they are excited, they want to go and meet all the fans.
"They're trying to meet all the fans' demands and not leave anybody out.
"But it's hard to be there for everybody all the time, but we've only got One Direction."
