The former headquarters of Royal Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh is to be turned into an Italian restaurant.

The chain Di Maggio's is to move into the historic building in St Andrew Square.
The Â£2m refurbishment will mean it can cater for 200 diners and have two bars.
The building, which was the headquarters until RBS moved to Gogarburn in 2005, is just three doors down from the RBS flagship branch for customers, Dundas House.
The 9,500 sq ft venue will feature the double height former banking hall with neoclassical and art deco original features.
It forms part of The Registers, a development by Chris Stewart Group, which will also have 50 luxury serviced apartments, new shops and offices.
Work is due to start in October 2017.
Tony Conetta, managing director of The Di Maggio's Restaurant Group (DRG), said: "This is an incredibly exciting project for us, in both an iconic building and location.
"The Edinburgh Grand's banking hall is rich in history, both for the capital and Scotland as a whole, and by carefully retaining and restoring the many original features we will bring this heritage to life.
"Our luxury restaurant and bar offering will have a Scottish influence at its heart and will make a significant contribution to Edinburgh's vibrant food and drink scene."
Meanwhile, city centre hotel Courtyard Edinburgh is creating 100 jobs ahead of its opening in December.
Courtyard Edinburgh, from Marriott International, is a contemporary four star hotel next to the Playhouse.
General manager Douglas Winfield has recently made a range of key appointments to start the recruitment drive.
