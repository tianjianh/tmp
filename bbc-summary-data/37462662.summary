[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have arrived in Canada with their children, five years after they visited the country as newly-weds.

The couple, along with Prince George, three, and 16-month-old Princess Charlotte, were greeted by Canadian PM Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire after landing in Victoria.
William said his children were starting a "lifetime of friendship" with Canada.
The trip is Charlotte's first official royal visit.

Later, in Victoria, the duke addressed a crowd of thousands outside the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, saying: "When we were here last time, we had been married only three months.
"The warm welcome that you gave us at that important moment in our lives meant a lot to us - and we have never forgotten it.
"That is why we are so pleased that George and Charlotte can be with us in Canada this time round, beginning their own lifetime of friendship with this wonderful country."

This was a still rare chance to see the Cambridges as a family of four.
Prince William and his wife continue to shield their children from the spotlight.
They landed in a city named after William's great-great-great-great-grandmother.
Despite the honour, Queen Victoria never made it to this part of her empire.
Her descendants will be here for eight days.
They represent the future, as things stand, of the throne she once occupied - in both the UK and some 4,000 miles away in Canada - where the British crown replaced a French one.
Despite a sizeable minority of the population yearning for a Canadian-born head of state, there is, as yet, no concrete political drive to change the status quo.
That status will be bolstered - at the very least emotionally - in the coming days by the images that will be captured of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and their parents.

The royal couple also attended a wreath-laying ceremony at the cenotaph in Victoria, as part of a service to honour the 158 Canadian service personnel who died during the War in Afghanistan.
On their eight-day visit their official engagements will include visiting pregnant women struggling with addiction and meeting First Nations communities.
Canada, a federation of former British colonies, is part of the Commonwealth with Queen Elizabeth as its head of state.
Their visit has been highly anticipated in Canada.
"A match made in paparazzi heaven" was how one Canadian newspaper greeted the news that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge would meet Mr Trudeau and his family.
Writing in The Globe and Mail, Daniel LeBlanc said the "glamorous" meeting would "add to the number of glitzy photo opps that have marked [Mr Trudeau's] first year in power".
But the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Janet Davison said the visit was "more than just photo opps" and was an attempt to "put a more modern glow" on the Royal Family, in a country where the Queen is the head of state but some people would prefer to move away from the monarchy.
The Vancouver Sun's Steven Hume said locals in Victoria, where the Duke and Duchess will arrive, were "still crazy for" the royals although the proportion of people with British roots had declined.
