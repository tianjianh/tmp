Jonjo Shelvey: Wolves players' evidence in racial abuse case 'compelling'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle United midfielder Jonjo Shelvey's five-game racial abuse ban was upheld on the strength of "clear and compelling" evidence by three Wolves players.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dominic Iorfa, Matt Doherty and Cameron Borthwick-Jackson all testified against Shelvey, 24, regarding comments made to Morocco midfielder Romain Saiss.
Their evidence confirmed that Shelvey had referred to Saiss' ethnic origin.
There were also "serious concerns" over the credibility of Shelvey's evidence.
England international Shelvey has chosen not to appeal against his fine and ban but maintains he did not use racially abusive language.
The incident between Shelvey and Saiss, 26, in Newcastle's 2-0 home Championship defeat by Wolves in September was started by the dismissal of Magpies midfielder Vurnon Anita.
The evidence presented by Wolves came from the three players, as well as assistant coach Rob Edwards, team doctor Matthew Perry and ex-coach Andrea Butti.
Shelvey called on team-mates Gayle and Aleksandar Mitrovic, the Serbia forward, for his defence.
The independent panel came down on the side of the Football Association, decided the organisation had "discharged its burden of proof on the balance of probabilities", and found Shelvey guilty.
Shelvey has been suspended for five games, required to pay Â£100,000, attend an FA education course, pay the costs of the hearing and was warned about his future conduct.
He had already confirmed he would not be appealing against the suspension, which starts with the visit of Sheffield Wednesday on 26 December.
