[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dover Athletic 1-4 Boreham Wood

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boreham Wood registered a stunning upset, winning 4-1 at 2015-16 play-off semi-finalists Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It looked positive for the Whites early on, as last season's 21-goal man Ricky Miller beat keeper Grant Smith from the penalty spot.
But Miller blotted his copybook by receiving his marching orders after the break for two yellow cards.
The Wood seized the initiative with the extra man, and Kenny Davis levelled with a penalty of his own. Bruno Andrade stabbed the visitors into the lead midway through the second half - but incredibly the best was yet to come for Luke Garrard's men.
Angelo Balanta added a third from close range, and Andrade smashed home a free-kick to complete a jamboree night for the Meadow Park club.
