Election 2015: Party leaders debate issues

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leaders of Scotland's four main parties will participate in a BBC debate on Sunday ahead of the general election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ruth Davidson of the Scottish Conservatives, Willie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Jim Murphy from Scottish Labour will all take part.
The Sunday Politics Scotland studio debate, presented by Gordon Brewer, will air at 11:35.
It will be shown on BBC One Scotland.
Elsewhere on the campaign trail, the Scottish Conservatives will focus on welfare, citing research appearing to show the Scottish public back them on the capping of benefits.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will campaign in Paisley, where she will meet former Labour supporters who have moved to her party and set out an SNP "guarantee" to Labour voters.
Scottish Labour will lead on pensions, warning full fiscal autonomy - which would see all taxes and welfare run by Holyrood and is supported by the SNP - would leave pensioners Â£1,000 a year worse off.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie will challenge the SNP to abandon the "accelerated pathway" to another referendum, saying any uncertainty will damage the economy.
