BSE: Change in status in NI could be worth £12m annually to beef industry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A change in disease status for Northern Ireland's beef industry could be worth £12m a year, it has been claimed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Northern Ireland currently has "controlled risk" status for BSE, a cattle disease.
The Department of Agriculture is consulting on whether to apply for regional "negligible risk" status.
If successful, the industry believes it would mean an "improved global image" that would open up new markets.
The decision to grant it rests with the World Organisation for Animal Health - an inter-governmental organisation on animal health.
Eating BSE-infected meat was linked to an outbreak of brain disease in humans in the 80s.
Since then strict controls have been imposed on parts of the carcass which can be used for food.
Those measures and a ban on animal feeds containing meat and bone-meal have all but eradicated the disease.
The last confirmed case in Northern Ireland was in 2012.
As 11 years have elapsed since that animal's date of birth, the authorities can apply for the enhanced status.
Scotland is in the same position.
A confirmed case in Wales last June means the United Kingdom can not make a country-wide application until 2020.
England is expected to defer its decision until then.
The Republic of Ireland got "negligible risk" status in May last year, but lost it again the following month after a case was detected in County Louth.
It has been returned to "controlled risk" status and can not reapply until 2021.
The consultation document acknowledges that "negligible risk" status brings trade advantages and could save the industry £1.2m a year spent on disposing of material which can not be sent for food.
But it said it could also mean having to re-negotiate current contracts leading to the potential for trade disruption.
It said given the potential for a sporadic BSE case, the resultant loss of "negligible risk" status could generate "considerable public concern and negative publicity".
It could also mean the requirement to recall some products, and the loss of some markets opened up by the new status.
The consultation closes in mid June.
