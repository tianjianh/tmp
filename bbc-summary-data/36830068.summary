"Pre-season can be hugely lucrative," football finance expert Rob Wilson told BBC Sport. "A club does a tour, they sell more products, there's more branding and more sponsors start to get involved.
"If they can generate £5m or £10m from a two-week tour, that's more than what some of the other clubs will get."
According to Wilson, from Sheffield Hallam University, China is an attractive proposition for the future due to its position as an "untapped" but "serious player" in the football market.
"What we've seen in the past 10 years is big clubs going further and further afield," Wilson added. "They are looking to leverage new markets, like China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Australia is not doing too bad."
Champions Leicester, Arsenal, Chelsea, Crystal Palace, Swansea and Southampton were among the teams to play in the United States.
However, Premier League clubs' trips could have a negative effect in the long run, according to USA Today sports columnist Martin Rogers.
"There is interest - the games are pretty well attended," said Rogers. "But as the American fan becomes sophisticated, they'll soon get tired of a second-string Chelsea side or a second-string Liverpool side.
"They know the difference between an exhibition game and a Major League Soccer game."
