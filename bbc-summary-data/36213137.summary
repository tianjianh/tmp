Goals Soccer Centres set to unveil new strategic plan

Five-a-side football company Goals Soccer Centres is set to reveal a new strategic plan, after completing a full review of its operations.

The review, led by new chairman Nick Basing, was set up after Goals reported its first annual loss in 12 years.
The company said it expected to complete the review within the week.
The news came as Paisley-based rival Powerleague announced it had opened the first of its "next generation" centres in London under a £40m expansion plan.
East Kilbride-based Goals currently operates 46 centres in the UK and one in California.
In a statement at the company's annual general meeting on Thursday, Mr Basing said: "The review of the company has included a wide-ranging view of the market, the performance of the company in recent years and an assessment of all assets that the company operates, along with consumer insights.
"We are drawing it to completion by next week and we will announce the results of this review together with the strategic plan shortly afterwards."
The review is one of six "short-term priorities" identified by Mr Basing when he took over the role of chairman in March.
Goals appears close to completing another of those priorities - finding a new chief executive.
Mr Basing said: "We have concluded the search for a high-quality CEO. Our expectation is that we will be able to announce details imminently."
Mr Basing also reported that a near-term operational improvement plan was being implemented, adding that the company had been "encouraged by the early signs".
However, he added: "On current trading, I can report that like-for-like sales are marginally negative for the first 18 weeks of the year.
"However, the significant decline in last year's second half has been eroded.
"This first quarter of trading in 2016 compares against positive sales growth in the same period last year."
In a separate development, Powerleague announced it had officially opened the first of its "next generation" five-a-side centres in west London.
The move marks the start of a £40m expansion plan by owners Patron Capital to open 13 new UK centres over the next three years.
The new facility takes Powerleague's overall number of centres to 49 and strengthens the brand's presence in the south-east of England - a key growth area for the operator.
The Next Generation programme marks a departure for Powerleague from its traditional focus on large three-acre sites.
Under the new approach, the company is looking to build pitches on as little as 0.5 acres - including at the top of multi-storey car parks, in underground spaces and on the roofs of buildings.
