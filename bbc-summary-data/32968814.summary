East of England Ambulance university courses fail to gain approval

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The issue of paramedics, who may not qualify until next year after two university courses failed to get approval, will be investigated, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has promised.

It comes after the Health and Care Professions Council said more work was needed on the University of East Anglia and Anglia Ruskin University courses.
The East of England Ambulance Service (EEAS) recruited the paramedics.
But, gaining approval was a university responsibility, the EEAS said.
The GMB said the ambulance service needed to "take responsibility".
Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South, raised the matter in the House of Commons.
He said the course had not been accredited and trainee paramedics had been left "Â£4,000 out of pocket" (the cost of the course).
Mr Hunt agreed he will take up the issue of the training of paramedics at EEAS.
Anglia Ruskin and the University of East Anglia both said they were working on a solution with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) who had asked for more information before it would approve the scheme.
UEA also said review was a normal part of the approval process and it would "begin delivery of the diploma by the end of this year".
The ambulance service, under fire from patients and the Department of Health for poor response times, had pledged to recruit and train 400 paramedics.
Recruits who had been "learning on the job while studying" were told in a letter the universities' failure "does not affect the development undertaken within the trust or ability to work after successfully completing it".
Tony Hughes, GMB union representative at the EEAS, said: "The EEAS should have ensure the course was in place in its entirety. It is not acceptable that halfway through their course they are told they can't complete it.
"This has just come out of the blue. Once again the EEAS is blaming others... and not taking the responsibility themselves."
Chris Hartley, East of England Ambulance Trust communications director, said the service had hundreds of frontline vacancies at the start of 2014.
"We are working closely with them (the universities) to ensure students are able to complete their qualification with as little delay as possible," he said.
The trust is also looking at other education providers with an existing approved programme.
