The 25-year-old, who had earlier finished fourth in the slopestyle, landed two triple corks to take top spot from Sweden's Henrik Harlaut on countback after both men scored 88.
Snowboarding big air will be making its Olympic debut next year in Pyeongchang.
Woods' compatriot Katie Ormerod had earlier won bronze in the women's snowboard slopestyle behind American pair Julie Marino and Jamie Anderson.
