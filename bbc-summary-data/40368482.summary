The former England international, who will turn 37 halfway through next season, is the oldest striker playing in the Premier League.
But Crouch is confident that he can go beyond the end of his current two-year deal, which expires in June 2018.
"Getting to a certain age where people are supposed to be retiring has made me hungrier," he told BBC Radio Stoke.
"I want to stay around for a lot longer yet. I love what I do.
"Coming in every day and playing football, then having a match at the end of it all, to work towards, is something that I've always loved and still want to do."
Crouch, who joined the Potters from Tottenham Hotspur for Â£10m in 2011, has scored 54 goals in 201 appearances for the club, more than he managed for any of his seven previous sides.
His tally includes 10 last season - seven in the league and a hat-trick at Stevenage in the League Cup - which made him Stoke's top scorer,
If Crouch carries on finding the net at Stoke beyond his 37th birthday on 30 January, he would join a select band of footballers who have scored in the Premier League in their 38th year.
Newcastle's Les Ferdinand and Gary Speed were both 37 when they scored final top-flight goals, as was goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel when he got his first, for Aston Villa in a 3-2 defeat to Everton in October 2001.
After firing Hull City to promotion in 2008, Dean Windass made just five appearances, and only one start in the top flight for the Tigers. But, at the age of 38, he did score against Crouch's Portsmouth before being moved on to Oldham.
Mick Harford (Wimbledon), penalty king Graham Alexander (Burnley), Blackburn midfielder Tugay, Crouch's own current boss Mark Hughes (also at Blackburn) and England full-back Stuart Pearce, with West Ham, were also 38 when they netted for the last time.
But the oldest was Teddy Sheringham, who scored the last of his 146 Premier League goals at the age of 40, for West Ham against Portsmouth on Boxing Day 2006.
