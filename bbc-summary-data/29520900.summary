Six memorable moments of The Apprentice as it turns 10

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The contestants change every year, but our reaction is always the same: "Can you believe they just said that?!"

The Apprentice has treated us to some fascinating people who we can't help but watch.
With Lord Sugar at the helm, they take on task after excruciating task, where mistakes are made, fingers are pointed and someone is fired.
There have been so many amazing moments in the last decade.
Here are six of our favourites:
"I'm Stuart Baggs The Brand. Everything I touch turns to sold." It was the first thing Stuart Baggs said on series six and thus a star (ahem) was born.
It didn't end there, with him also claiming: "I'm not a one-trick pony. I'm not a ten-trick pony. I'm a whole field of ponies, and they're literally all running towards this job."
We think he would have got on seriously well with series five's Ben Clarke, you know, the one that mentioned he had an honorary scholarship to top military academy Sandhurst about 5,000 times.
His strapline: "To me, making money is better than sex."
Then there was Alex Epstein from series six who came out with: "Be different. When everyone is zigging, you should zag."
Remember when Shibby Robati from series six said: "My first word wasn't mummy; it was money."
It was one of many countless claims which have been made over the years to impress Lord Sugar, though quite clearly aren't true.
There was more gold to come from good ol' Shibby, his highlight being when he promised a posh London hotel 1,000 breakfast rolls and delivered just 16.
He then advised the irate chef to tell the guests to "go on the Atkins Diet".
Not surprisingly Shibby didn't last long after that.
Of course Nick Hewer and Karren Brady are a good team, but who could forget the Nick and Margaret years.
The pair would together stare frostily at every batch of contestants who dared to enter, a mixed expression of horror and confusion across their faces.
Margaret never had time for compliments or praise, instead choosing to coolly rip the teams' performances apart with remarks like: "Never before in the history of car washing have so few cars been washed by so many people in such a long time."
This complemented Nick's dry humour perfectly.
One of our favourite quips was when the teams in series six had to set up a boutique.
Sales were slow so Stella (who went on to win the show) was made to stand in the shop window to attract customers.
Nick's take on the situation was as follows: "Behind me, you can see Stella in a short dress, waving at people from a window. In Manchester? No. In Amsterdam? Maybe."
In his team's advert for breakfast cereal Phillip Taylor decided a character who wore his underwear over his trousers called Pantsman was the best way to sell it.
It wasn't.
He crashed and burned in the task and the boardroom.
Our favourite dig came from Nick who claimed Phillip (or Pantsman as we prefer to call him) "took logic and tortured it until it screamed".
On the flipside Phillip was more successful with the ladies and struck up a romance with fellow contestant and runner-up Kate Walsh.
Before series six, most of us would not know the difference between cedarwood and sandalwood, but thanks to eventual winner Yasmina Siadatan and one of her teammates we know all too well that when trying to make cheap body care products you really shouldn't confuse the two.
For cedarwood costs just Â£26 a kilo, sandalwood is a whopping Â£1,200 a kilo.
Nick pointed out the mistake, but in his glorious fashion waited until it was too late.
The words "I'll leave it with you" were left hanging in the air as he sloped away from the grim looking contestants.
Oh, we love a good villain and there are just so many to choose from.
However, Debra Barr from series five certainly deserves a mention.
Her rivals physically cowered away from the 23-year-old during boardroom arguments and when Lord Sugar fired her in the penultimate episode she told him he had made "the biggest mistake of his life". (We think he got over it).
And we can't forget Katie Hopkins, who was fairly outspoken in series three long before she was being controversial on daytime TV shows.
Remember when she called one of her female rivals, "too orange to be taken seriously".
Now many might claim Lord Sugar to be a villain, but with lines like this, we would have to disagree: "Could it be you're here because you're good with words and know the right thing to say at the right time?
"I know the words to Candle in the Wind. It don't make me Elton John."
The Apprentice returns with a double bill on 14 and 15 October on BBC One.
