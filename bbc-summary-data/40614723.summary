[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of Wales' biggest youth movement has quit after concerns from staff about her leadership.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sioned Hughes was appointed less than two-years-ago to lead Urdd Gobaith Cymru towards its centenary in 2022.
But BBC Cymru Wales' Newyddion 9 has learned trustees intervened after staff voiced a lack of faith in her ability.
The Urdd, which has 53,000 members, said she had left after a "mutual agreement". Ms Hughes declined to comment.
There is no suggestion that Ms Hughes had misbehaved or there was maladministration in any way.
In a statement the Urdd said: "Sioned Hughes and the movement had come to a mutual agreement that her employment as chief executive is to come to an end.
"The Urdd thanks her for her service and wishes her well in the future."
