Caerphilly Castle Ladies' results in the Women's Welsh Premier League will be wiped out.
This season the side, whose first team walked out last summer, also found themselves on the wrong end of 36-0, 28-0 and 26-0 scorelines.
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) said the club had taken the move "with regret".

The team, known as the Castle, found themselves in the headlines following the latest defeat, which meant the side had let in 219 goals and scored just one in 10 games.
Club officials had said earlier this week they were putting a "brave face" on the results and had no intention of giving up, but the statement issued through the FAW indicated the club will focus on bringing on youth players.
It said: "With regret, the club has decided to withdraw its membership from the Welsh Premier Women's League with immediate effect.
"Caerphilly Castle is very proud of its tradition of nurturing young footballing talent over the years but the club has found it difficult to compete at the highest level of Welsh Women's Football this season.
"The committed officials of the club fully intend to continue their passion of developing players throughout the different age groups and hope to return to the Welsh Premier Women's League as soon as possible."
The senior team's results will be wiped from the records, but the club wished the 11 sides remaining in the league luck for the rest of the season.
In terms of numbers participating at all levels, Caerphilly Castle rival Cardiff City for the title of biggest women's club in Wales.
They finished mid-table in the last two Welsh Premier League seasons, and in 2010 lifted the Welsh League Cup.
