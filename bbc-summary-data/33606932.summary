[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The car which set a land speed record for Sir Malcolm Campbell has been brought back to the scene of the triumph in Carmarthenshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Blue Bird, which was built in 1919, set a record 90 years ago of more than 150mph (241km/h).
The car, now kept at the National Motor Museum in Hampshire, was driven at low speed by Sir Malcolm's grandson, Don Wales, at Pendine Sands.
It was fired up for the first time in 50 years following a rebuild last year.
