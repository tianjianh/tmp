An experienced teacher and social worker of 20 years, Mrs Jumbe-Kahura left her well-paid job at a child rights organisation to return to her first love: Teaching.
Named as one of the top 10 finalists of the Global Teacher Prize this year, she is a volunteer at two schools in Kilifi County, where she encourages smaller groups and more interactive learning, such as field trips, to inspire pupils' creativity.
She also sits on Kilifi County Education Board, which manages teaching in more than 400 schools and also runs her organisation Lifting the Barriers, which supports hundreds of pupils with everything from uniforms and sanitary facilities to sexual health education and careers coaching.
