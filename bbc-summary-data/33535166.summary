Murphy the German Shepherd found himself feeling a little under par - after swallowing six golf balls.

The problem came to light when seven-year-old Murphy became sick while eating a bone.
His owner, David Larson, of Jarrow, took him to a vets in Newcastle where staff took X-rays and spotted mystery objects in his stomach.
Vet Mandy Ball immediately operated on him, removing the balls. Murphy has since made a full recovery.
Mr Larson said: "There were some foreign bodies inside his stomach but the vets couldn't identify what they were, so [they] operated at their hospital and saved his life.
"I've only had him for 18 months and he has never come into contact with golf balls during that time, so they must have been lodged inside him for a long time. I've noticed since the operation he is much brighter and much more playful."
