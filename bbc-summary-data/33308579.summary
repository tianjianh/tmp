[SN]TITLE[SN]
Paul Liam Duddy: Court told of 'paramilitary threats'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who has pleaded guilty to drugs offences was recently threatened by paramilitaries, Londonderry Magistrates' Court has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Liam Duddy, from Ardnamoyle Park in Derry, appeared in court on Monday where he admitted possession of herbal cannabis, diazepam and viagra.
Police found the drugs in his bedroom when they searched his home in April.
The court heard he was threatened while he was serving a community service sentence for a separate conviction.
His defence solicitor told the court that the Probation Service was now trying to find another location outside Derry to enable Duddy to complete his community service.
He added that his client was now in rehab and had not used drugs since police made the seizure on 21 April.
The judge imposed a Â£250 fine on Duddy and ordered that the drugs must be destroyed.
