Watson, 24, was fined $12,000 (£9,043) for jamming her racket into the grass having squandered three match-points.
The fine is almost one-third of her total tournament prize money (£30,000).
Italian Fabio Fognini was handed a record $20,000 (£15,702) penalty for his conduct during a 2014 match.
Elsewhere, defending champion Serena Williams was fined $10,000 (£7,536) for smashing her racket during her second-round win against Christina McHale.
Serb Viktor Troicki was also fined $10,000 for his rant at chair umpire Damiano Torella during the climax of his five-set loss to Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
The reaction came a result of the official over-ruling a line call that gave Spaniard Ramos-Vinolas match point, which he took.
