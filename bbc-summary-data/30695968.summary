[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clarence Edwards, 26, was found with stab wounds following a disturbance on Charles Street outside the RBase club in the early hours of Sunday.
Mr Edwards was taken to hospital but later died of his injuries.
His family said: "No mother should have to bury their child - our lives will never be the same again."
The statement continued: "Clarence was a beautiful son; he was a brother, a father, a nephew, uncle and great friend to many.
"He loved life; he loved his family and his friends.
"Clarence wanted nothing more than to make people happy.  He wanted to be a father and see his son grow up, but cowards have taken his life so soon."
Two men have been arrested by police on suspicion of his murder.
A 37-year-old is still being questioned while a second, aged 26, has been bailed.
Mr Edwards was jailed for his role in the 2011 death of John Lee Barrett.
Mr Edwards was convicted of violent disorder and sentenced to two-and-a-half years in March 2013.
He was one of 12 men jailed over that death.
