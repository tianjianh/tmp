Thomas Allsopp's Audi A8 was clocked hitting 149mph on the M6 Toll - and he later told police he only stopped because he had run out of petrol.
He only had a provisional driving licence and was uninsured, so he should not have been on the road at all.
The 24-year-old, from Leicestershire, was given a suspended sentence.
PC Jim Barry, who works with the Central Motorway Police Group, said his driving was "extremely reckless and dangerous".
"At one stage he overtook a recovery truck on a blind bridge entering Minworth village," he said.
"Allsopp showed no remorse and said he had no intention of stopping for officers - only stopping because he ran out of fuel - and agreed he didn't give his three passengers any opportunity to exit his vehicle."
West Midlands Police officers on street racing patrols on the A38 originally spotted him parked across an emergency vehicle access slip road to the motorway on 27 December.
They approached him but he sped off down the A38, and was caught on camera weaving in and out of traffic.
Police followed him along the M6 Toll, where he ended up crashing through exit barriers.
Allsopp, from Roston Drive in Hinckley, admitted dangerous driving and other motoring offences.
He was given an eight-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Birmingham Crown Court on Monday.
He was also ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for 18 months.
