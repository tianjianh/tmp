Council reveals Dumfries DG One centre repair cost contribution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has revealed the scale of its financial contribution to major repair work at its flagship leisure centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year Dumfries and Galloway Council refused to release the details following a BBC Scotland news website Freedom of Information request.
It has now confirmed it will pay just over £1.3m towards remedial works at the DG One centre in Dumfries.
The case was taken to the Scottish Information Commission but the council has now voluntarily revealed the sum.
The DG One centre shut in October 2014 but a legal wrangle between the council and the original builders meant works could not start for nearly two years.
They finally got under way in September last year with a timeframe of about 18 months for completion.
The £17m centre opened in 2008 but suffered a string of problems which led to its complete closure in 2014.
The total cost of repairing the issues uncovered is just short of £10m and contractors McLaughlin and Harvey started site works on 5 September last year.
Dumfries and Galloway Council had refused to reveal the scale of its contribution when first sought via an FOI request.
However, it has now confirmed the figure to be £1.301m.
