The Scotland lock has been forced to have further surgery for the broken forearm he picked up in October's European Challenge Cup game with Lyon.
Edinburgh said in a statement: "Grant has, unfortunately, fallen into a percentage of people who can have a delayed healing response."
Gilchrist picked up his injury shortly after being named Scotland captain.
New national coach Vern Cotter had earmarked the 24-year-old to lead the squad in the autumn Tests against Argentina, New Zealand and Tonga.
But Gilchrist did not feature in any of the games because of his injury.
The decision for revision surgery was taken after consultation with upper limb specialist Mr Doug Campbell at Spire Hospital Leeds," added Edinburgh's statement.
"Following a period of rest, Grant will continue his rehabilitation under the care of the Edinburgh Rugby and Scotland medical teams."
