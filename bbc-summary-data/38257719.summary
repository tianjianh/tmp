The 42-year-old had regained the lead from Frenchman Armel Le Cl√©ac'h, but was second as he passed the halfway mark just off New Zealand's south island.
Thomson's next milestone is to turn north at Cape Horn as he heads towards the finish port of Les Sables d'Olonne.
Gosport-based Thomson  is aiming to be the first Briton to win the race.

"There are a few hectic days to come and I will certainly be approaching them with caution to make sure that I keep Hugo Boss (Thomson's boat) in one piece," he said.
"It's over 1000 miles behind me to third place, so at least I have some breathing space behind so I can worry about looking forwards, which I think is really important".
