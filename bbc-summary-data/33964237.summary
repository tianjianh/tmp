Josh Henson, from Rhondda Cynon Taff, was 300m (980 ft) away from the Erawan Shrine having a meal when the blast happened on Monday.
He said shops had shut early and traffic was at a standstill as medics tried to deal with the casualties.
But he said Thai authorities had dealt with the situation "superbly".
Mr Henson, of Brynna, was celebrating his 10-year-old cousin's birthday when the bomb exploded.
He and his relatives quickly began checking social media and news services to find out what had happened before returning to their hotel near the bomb site.
"It was just a horrible atmosphere and we just felt on edge and just so uneasy walking down the main street," he said.
"There was traffic - the cars were just stopped still. It was a very uneasy walk, it was not nice at all.
"We do feel a level of safety as we have been watching the news and we have found out about how they are dealing with the situation at the moment, [but] there is a level of caution that we do have to take."
Mr Henson said he and his family had planned to visit the capital's Grand Palace on Tuesday but they would be changing their plans on the advice of the Thai authorities.
The Erawan Shrine, which was crowded at the time, is a major tourist attraction and foreigners, including Chinese, are among the reported casualties.
No-one has yet said they carried out the attack, but Thailand's defence minister Prawit Wongsuwon said the bombers had "targeted foreigners... to damage tourism and the economy".
