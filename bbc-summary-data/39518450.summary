Leeds International Festival features 35 events over nine days, with both ticketed and free elements.
BBC Broadcaster Lauren Laverne will host an 'Empowering Women with Tech' conference and a new film about Leeds United will be given its premiere.
Andrew Cooper, festival chair, said it would "change perceptions" of the city.
Running between April 22-30, it coincides with the yearly Live at Leeds music festival and will also see talks about cyber security and sustainable fashion.
The festival is being funded by Leeds Business Improvement District, a not for profit organisation which promotes the city.
Documentary 'Do You Want To Win' tells the story of Leeds United from 1988-1992 and features interviews with former players including Gordon Strachan and Vinnie Jones.
Mr Cooper said: "When people come to Leeds they realise things have changed significantly over the last five years and people are saying, 'this is different, there's something happening about Leeds, there's a buzz about it'.
"Events really shape a place and put it on a map - we want to do that through the festival and really celebrate everything about Leeds."
