Crematorium worker Derek Snow in baby ashes investigation loses job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A senior member of staff at an Aberdeen crematorium being investigated over its handling of babies' ashes has lost his job.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crematorium superintendent Derek Snow was suspended from his role at the Hazlehead facility last month.
Former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini is investigating the possible mishandling of ashes at crematoria around Scotland, including Hazlehead.
An earlier council investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing.
The city authority is now recruiting a new crematorium manager.
The crematorium at Hazlehead was among those across the country investigated after it emerged staff at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh had been burying babies' ashes in secret for decades.
BBC Scotland revealed last year that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period.
A group of parents alleging wrongful disposal of ashes launched legal action against Aberdeen City Council at the Court of Session in February.
And the local authority later revealed it changed its processes for the cremation of children from November last year, recovering ashes and returning them to parents in all cases.
