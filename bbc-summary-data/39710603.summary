[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ex-teacher Gordon Fleming admits sexual abuse of girls

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Powys primary school teacher has admitted a string of historical sex offences against young girls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Swansea Crown Court heard that Gordon Fleming, from Oswestry, Shropshire, abused two dozen children over a six-year period in the 1970s and 80s.
The 66-year-old pleaded guilty to 24 counts of indecent assault against girls under the age of 13.
Judge Geraint Walters told Fleming he should expect to receive a "significant prison sentence".
Fleming, who was convicted of a similar offence at Chester Crown Court in 1992, blew a kiss to his wife in the public gallery before being taken down to the cells.
He was remanded in custody and will reappear at Swansea Crown Court on 5 May ahead of his sentence.
