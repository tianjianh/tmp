The result puts Gerard Lyttle's men two points behind Glenavon who drew 1-1 at home to Ballymena United.
Carrick had taken the lead in the 20th minute when defender Andrew Doyle headed in from James Wright's corner.
Jay Donnelly headed in a 55th-minute equaliser and Hughes drilled in the late winner on 89.
Cliftonville manager Gerard Lyttle: "We are delighted to get the win and it is nothing more than we deserved.
"In the first half they threw a lot of high balls in to the box and to be fair I think we coped really well with them apart from one lapse in concentration when they scored.
"But our fight and determination were there. We showed great heart and there was no way we were going to lose that game."
Carrick Rangers manager Gary Haveron: "We were the creators of our own downfall really.
"The first goal was avoidable, a cross in to the box and the lad attacked the ball well but I would expect our keeper to make a save on that one and he has held his hands up in the dressing room.
"We failed to clear for the second goal and the ball falls to a boy you don't want it to fall to and he has put it away well."
