The company now licenses the brand for its devices, after Blackberry decided to outsource the development and manufacture of its smartphones.
The device was unveiled ahead of the start of the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona.
TCL's Nicolas Zibell told the BBC's Chris Foxx that he hoped to revive the brand with "strong products".
