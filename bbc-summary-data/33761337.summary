Milton Keynes Council has estimated the case against Tina Beloveth Powerful will cost around £8,000.
Powerful has been found guilty of fraud, but has failed to turn up for sentencing on three occasions.
Milton Keynes North MP Mark Lancaster said taxpayers should not have to pay for the trial.
The case against Powerful is being brought by Milton Keynes Trading Standards.
The council told the BBC it will have cost "around £8,000" when finished.
Tina Beloveth Powerful timeline:
•17 October, 2014: Tina Beloveth Powerful was first listed to appear at magistrates' court, but failed to attend
•11 November, 2014: The case was adjourned three times, including two no shows, before Powerful pleaded not guilty
•24 April: On the seventh time the case had gone to court, the trial had to be adjourned after Powerful shouted at magistrates
•19 June: Powerful found guilty
•10 July: Powerful supplied a sick note to the court, case adjourned
•17 July: Powerful failed to attend sentencing for a second time. A warrant was issued for her arrest
•24 July: Despite being arrested and bailed to appear at the court, Powerful again failed to attend. An arrest warrant, without bail, was issued
During the trial, the court heard Powerful has no income.
Mr Lancaster, said: "Despite her best efforts to avoid it, justice has finally caught up on Tina Beloveth.
"It's clear the cost to the taxpayer has been disproportionately high as a result of her failing to turn up to court. I believe that she and not the taxpayer should pay for this."
Powerful, 47, from Milton Keynes, was described as "dishonest" at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court after being found guilty of fraud and false advertising.
