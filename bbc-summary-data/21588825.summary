[SN]TITLE[SN]
£5m bid for new Kenilworth railway station

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire County Council has bid for £5m of government money to go towards the construction of a new railway station in Kenilworth.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £11.3m station would be served by a local service between Leamington Spa and Coventry.
The government has set aside a total of £20m to pay for 75% of the cost of either building or renovating stations in England and Wales.
The rest of the money for the scheme would come from the county council.
It is hoped work would begin on the site by autumn next year if the authority is successful with its New Stations Fund bid.
Councillor Peter Butlin, the Conservative-run council's portfolio holder for transport and highways, said: "With the introduction of the new train service, the benefits are going to be felt over a much wider area as it will help relieve overcrowding on existing services.
"It is also going to provide better access to employment opportunities in the Coventry and Warwickshire sub-region and support economic growth."
