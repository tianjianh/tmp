NI legal aid payments: Barristers in 'determined' mood over strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barristers are determined to continue a strike over cuts to legal aid payments for "as long as is necessary", the Bar Council of Northern Ireland has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barristers have withdrawn from all new criminal cases requiring legal aid, in protest against the reduced payments.
Bar Council chairman, Gerry McAlinden, said the cuts meant barristers will not get "any money" for aspects of cases.
But the justice minister said Northern Ireland could not continue to fund the UK's highest level of legal aid pay.
David Ford, who is facing cuts to his departmental budget along with other Northern Ireland Executive ministers, has introduced new rules this month that reduce the legal aid payments available to lawyers who undertake criminal case work.
Last week, it emerged that the Bar Council of Northern Ireland and the Law Society have joined forces in a legal action against the minister, in an attempt to get the High Court to overturn the new payment rules.
Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster, Mr McAlinden said: "What these rules simply mean is that, for a lot of the work that is required to properly do a case - a criminal case or a civil case - the lawyers will not get any money.
"Basically, what in essence is happening under the 2015 rules in relation to criminal cases is that, for the work that is required - such as looking at documents that are disclosed by the Crown, looking at expert reports, looking at the documentation that is necessary to determine whether those expert reports are accurate in their conclusions - that type of work will not be paid under these rules."
The Bar Council chairman added: "It means that there is the potential for corners to be cut, in terms of the proper investigation when looking at criminal cases, and that cannot be allowed. Criminal practitioners must be properly remunerated for the work that is required to protect the defendants' interest. It's a simple matter of justice."
Mr McAlinden said the mood among his colleagues was "one of utter determination to ensure that this action holds for as long as is necessary, so that the message gets across to the minister that enough is enough".
Speaking on the same programme, the justice minister said he had to be "realistic about the money that is available, in terms of protecting the public, in terms of things like essential policing services, prisons, youth justice, probation".
"All of those have to be dealt with within the justice budget and we cannot continue to fund the highest rates of legal aid, and that is the reality of what is being asked."
Mr Ford faced down a similar legal aid strike by solicitors in 2011, but eventually, a number of law firms agreed to work for reduced payments.
The barristers' action only affects new criminal cases, as they will continue with cases that began before the new payment rules came into effect earlier this month.
