Non Stanford column: 'Our business is to win medals'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The wait is almost over. This is it. I can't wait. My Olympic season starts this weekend.

It's all about medals at this summer's Olympic Games in Rio and I'll make no secret of that.
Team GB will certainly expect to bring a medal home between the three of us in the women's squad. That is our business. We need to deliver.
My season starts on Sunday in the latest round of the World Triathlon series in Cape Town.
I'm really looking forward to getting back out there and seeing where I am at the end of this stage of my training.
The body feels ready after a good winter of training and I think I am now ready to get away from my home in Leeds and do some travelling and get back to racing.
There's the social side too, seeing a lot of old friends you only see on the circuit.
I am not putting too much pressure on myself though as the idea is to be in peak condition by August.
But I suppose you never go into a race not wanting to do well and I hope that I am able to fight for a place on that podium.
I don't have the kind of pressure others do, I have been qualified for a few months and that means all the pressure will come in August. At the moment, it's all just building towards that.
It is just the pressure that we as athletes put on ourselves.
This year has been quite exciting, waiting and delaying the start of our season and watching the Olympic selection process unfold.
I didn't watch Helen Jenkins' victory in the Gold Coast World Series event in Australia because it was the middle of the night.
But I did wake up just as she was crossing the finishing line and had a cheeky check on Twitter.
It was fantastic and I was absolutely delighted to see Helen produce such an incredible performance
It shows what sort of athlete she is, getting it right on the day, when it really, really counted in her battle for the GB place against Jodie Stimpson.
That is what the Olympics are really all about.

She seems to be in a strong position, she knew she needed to win in Australia and from a personal point of view, I would be really surprised if Helen doesn't get selected.
But at the end of the day, it is down to the selectors and comes down to what they are thinking and what they see.
They are looking to help Team GB to bring home as many medals as possible.
If two-thirds of the team is made up of Welsh girls, I think would be great for us and reflect very well on Team Wales.
I don't envisage getting a chance to return to my hometown Swansea before the Olympics.
It's going to be a while until I see the Welsh coast again, but the beaches in Rio are pretty cool.
Non Stanford was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Catrin Heledd.
