[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 1-0 Guiseley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Guiseley remain winless in the National League after they fell to a defeat at Sutton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Connor Brown had a debut to forget for the Lions when he diverted a Kevin Amankwaah cross into his own goal.
The U's built early pressure with Chris Dickson, Roarie Deacon and Dan Wishart wasting good opportunities to open the scoring before Brown's own goal gave them the lead just before the break.
Bottom club Guiseley almost equalised when Jordan Preston had a 30-yard effort denied by a wonderful save from Ross Worner before Preston and substitute Michael Rankine had golden chances to level from close range late on but could not convert.
