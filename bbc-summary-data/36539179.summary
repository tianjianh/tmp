The 27-year-old, who scored three goals in 52 appearances for the Exiles last season, has agreed a two-year deal with the Gills.
The Irishman has previously played under Gillingham boss Justin Edinburgh at Rushden & Diamonds and Newport.
"When I found out there was interest from Justin, I was more than happy to work with him again," he said.
Edinburgh signed Byrne from Barnet in summer 2014, when he was in charge at Rodney Parade, and considered a move for the former Nottingham Forest trainee in January.
Byrne becomes Gillingham's first signing of the summer.
