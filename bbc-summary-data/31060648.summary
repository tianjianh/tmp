A new mural has been unveiled in Belfast to commemorate the city's shipbuilding heritage.

The mural on Pilot Street contains 58 images that relate to the maritime and social heritage of Belfast port over the last two centuries.
Five historical figures including James Connolly, Jim Larkin and Winifred Carney are also included.
The group behind the mural say they hope it will boost tourism and engage people in the docks history.
Brian Quinn, from the Shared History Interpretive Project (SHIP), said it had been a "painstaking but rewarding process" putting the mural together.
"We had the idea of putting together a new mural because the previous one had been damaged," he said.
"We wanted to put something together that really told the story of the people who worked in the shipyards
"It will be a great opportunity for people to learn more about this part of Belfast. There's a lot more to shipyards than Harland and Wolff and the Titanic.
"Each picture on the mural tells a story and we have a booklet which explains each picture and why it was chosen".
Many of the photographs in the mural were provided by members of the local community who have a connection to the docks.
SHIP plan to hold lectures in front of the mural and give talks to school children and tourists.
Mr Quinn's great uncle John Quinn is also commemorated in the mural.
A docker by trade, he was also a key player in the union movement alongside Jim Larkin and James Connolly and the 1907 strike.
"It will be a very proud moment to see his picture on the mural," he said.
"We want to thank everyone who has helped us put the mural together and we hope people like it."
