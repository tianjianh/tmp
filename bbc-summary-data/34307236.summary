[SN]TITLE[SN]
Henry V 'secret' chapel opened for Agincourt anniversary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Westminster Abbey is opening Henry's V's chapel - rarely seen by the public - for guided tours to mark the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The chapel was built within the shrine of Edward the Confessor.
Henry V ordered the chapel's construction so prayers could be said for his soul after he died.
Tours of the chapel, located at the east end of the abbey, will be led by the Dean of Westminster on the eve of the battle's anniversary on 24 October.
A public ballot for places will open on Tuesday, with six places available per tour, a spokesman for the Abbey said.
Henry V ascended the English throne in 1413
The Battle of Agincourt took place on 25 October 1415 in a muddy field in Picardy, northern France, and was just one battle between the English and French in the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453)
Henry V had been leading his troops back to Calais when the French blocked his path to the sea in order to engage him in fighting
The English forces secured victory in about three hours
The fame of the battle spread because the French had outnumbered the English fighters, although the exact figure/ratio is disputed
The chapel is not usually open to the public because of its access issues.
