[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A final consultation event has been held on proposals to use a former Scots nuclear plant to store radioactive waste from redundant submarines.

Chapelcross, near Annan, is one of five sites being considered but is the only one north of the border.
Capenhurst in Cheshire, Sellafield in west Cumbria and Aldermaston and Burghfield, both in Berkshire, are the other possible locations.
The consultation was at the Victoria Halls in Annan on Friday.
Councillor Ronnie Ogilvie, who chairs the Chapelcross Site Stakeholders Group, said it was important as many people as possible took the opportunity to examine the proposals and express their opinion.
The UK government has pledged that public opinion will be taken into account in deciding the final location.
Consultation will run until February around all the locations on the shortlist.
Ministers are planning that waste from nuclear-powered Royal Navy submarines which have left service would be stored at one of the sites until "some time after 2040" when the UK's deep level underground waste dump is available.
