The crisis behind BeatBullying's collapse

For a decade it provided vulnerable young people with a lifeline - then it disappeared overnight.

Two months after the BeatBullying Group shutdown its services, there are calls for an investigation into how and why this happened.
Anti-bullying charities, former employees and young service users are all demanding answers.
The Charity Commission says it's their intention to publish a full report next year.
The BeatBullying Group looked after both the anti-bullying charity BeatBullying and the mental health charity MindFull UK.
Back in October bosses admitted it was having money problems, and agreed to call in an administrator in a bid to keep the company running.
Since then though the charity has gone into voluntary liquidation with debts of more than £1 million.
Board trustees have told Newsbeat they've been advised not to discuss the circumstances that led to its sudden collapse.
That silence has been met with frustration from young service users, former employees and other charities.
Alex Holmes is the Vice Chair of the Anti-Bullying Alliance.
"This was public money and clearly if that hasn't been used effectively there needs to be an investigation into that," he said.
"I think there's a real role for the Charity Commission to play here, questions for the trustees to answer and ultimately the management team."
Newsbeat has approached the Charity Commission on numerous occasions, but so far they've refused to talk to us.
In a statement they said: "We have met the trustees of the charity who have provided us with information about how the charity got into this position.
"We are currently analysing this information, along with information from other sources, to determine whether there are any regulatory concerns."
Over the past three years the BeatBullying Group's received over £2 million in public funds.
In 2011 the Office for Civil Society awarded the charity £1.3 million to expand its services.
It also received funding from the Cabinet Office, European Commission and £850,000 donation from ITV's Text Santa Appeal.
The broadcaster says they're still seeking legal advice over that donation.
Leann used the online chatroom service on both charities websites almost everyday.
"I'll never have answers and that's one thing I hate," she said.
"I feel quite angry towards everything because it's affected how I trust the new people coming in to my life."
And Leann isn't alone.
16-year-old Chloe started having problems at school and began worrying about exams, she didn't want to speak to her friends about it.
It was then she turned to Mindfull UK.
Chloe said: "They gave you really good advice, pushed you to speak to people and were always just there on a daily basis if you needed them.
When the service went offline Chloe said it felt like "someone had died".
If you want to talk about bullying, the BBC Advice pages have links to charities which can help.
Several former employees who have contacted Newsbeat say the charity was badly run.
One told us many staff are still waiting to be paid, while another claims the office became increasingly hostile as money problems continued to mount.
It's not clear how many staff are affected, but the 2012 accounts said it employed 44 and had more than 5,000 volunteers.
BeatBullying's founder Emma-Jane Cross and former executives Ross Banford and Sarah Dyer have since set up another company called Digital Impacts.
Banford told Newsbeat: "We would really like to stress that we would never set up any new organisation that would be in direct competition with any BB Group programme.
"We are simply developing a new product and business," he said.
