Mavididi has yet to make a first-team appearance for the Gunners, but was the top scorer for the club's Under-21 side last season with 17 goals in 30 games.
The 18-year-old, who can operate as a winger or striker, joins after the Addicks loaned Nicky Ajose to Swindon.
"He's certainly got the key components to succeed in what I call 'real' football," said boss Karl Robinson.
"He has the power, the game intelligence and this move is one that he has to grab with both hands."
