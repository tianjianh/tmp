The Cardinals took the lead through Matt Robinson's third goal of the season, a fine long-range effort.
Gateshead levelled just before half time though, Ryan Bowman converting a penalty after James Curtis was fouled by Brian Saah.
Robinson was denied by Gateshead goalkeeper Sam Russell late on as neither side could find a winner.
The result leaves both sides near the middle of the table, with Gateshead eight points from the play-offs with three games to play and Woking safe from relegation despite a winless run that stretches back to January.
Woking boss Garry Hill told BBC Surrey:

"You are always happy with a point but you want to win games and I felt over the 90 minutes if any team was going to win or deserved to win it was going to be us.
"The frustrating part was in the last five games we have been 1-0 up and 2-0 up in those ones. We are giving away cheap goals and we've invited teams back in the match from experienced players."
