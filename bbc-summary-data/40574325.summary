[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Hall scored his 250th career try to help Leeds Rhinos remain second in Super League with a come-from-behind victory over Hull FC at Headingley.

Hull prop Scott Taylor squeezed over for the first-half's only try, and Marc Sneyd's drop goal just before the break put the visitors 7-0 up.
Hall responded with a milestone try in the corner, before Jack Walker's score put Leeds ahead for the first time.
Josh Griffin and Mahe Fonua went close for Hull late on, but Leeds survived.
With 10 minutes remaining Griffin looked to dive over but his effort was chalked off following a forward pass, and some desperate defending by the hosts helped deny Fonua as he knocked on.
Leeds' victory, coupled with Salford's defeat by leaders Castleford, ensured Brian McDermott's Rhinos will start the Super 8s in second place, and completes the club's remarkable return to being a force.
A stuttering start to their 2017 campaign left McDermott facing pressure to keep his job, after the club's battle to avoid relegation via the Qualifiers last season, having collected the treble just 12 months before that.
The win to seal their place in the top four - which comes with the added bonus of an extra home match in the Super 8s - was both costly and hard fought after centre Stevie Ward suffered a head knock and Keith Galloway was forced off with an Achilles injury inside 12 minutes.
Leeds are now unbeaten in eight meetings between the two sides, with the pair facing one another next in the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup on Saturday, 29 July.
Leeds Rhinos boss Brian McDermott:
"It was dogged. There was a lot of fight, I don't think there was much finesse about it.
"I thought in the first half we challenged Hull a bit with the ball but they were very solid defensively.
"We had 14 men for a lot of the game. It was not pretty, but sometimes it doesn't have to be.
Hull FC coach Lee Radford:
"We'll have to strip everything back to put it right, as a coach there's plenty to go at. We're second in the comp for errors and it's not pretty.
"It jumps out at you, the basic schoolboy handling errors that, for whatever reason, have really crept in.
"It's a theme of conversation we're having every week and it can't continue."
