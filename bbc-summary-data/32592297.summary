Emily introduces her 6m (20ft) graphics screen which will show every result from across the country. You can also get a preview of the technical wizardry that will have Jeremy Vine standing in the House of Commons and outside 10 Downing Street without leaving the studio.
Election 2015 begins at 21:55 BST on Thursday on BBC One in England, and at 22:30 BST on BBC Two in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It will also be streamed live on the BBC News website.
There will also be coverage on the BBC News Channel and BBC World News.
The video works best in full screen.
The Election 2015 studio is at the BBC Elstree site north of London. Click to see a timelapse video of the impressive set being put together.
Presenters include David Dimbleby, Huw Edwards, Laura Kuenssberg, Andrew Neil, Sophie Raworth, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine. Emily Maitlis will be monitoring the exit polls and all the results as they arrive using a six-metre touch screen. Click to see it in action.
Part of the Election 2015 studio is given over to a huge green screen area. Here Jeremy Vine will be able to walk among three-dimensional graphics to explain how the political parties are faring in their key battlegrounds and how the chamber of the House of Commons could look as the distribution of MPs becomes clear. Watch the video to see Jeremy in action.
The engine driving the BBC's election analysis is a team of psephologists - people who study elections - who will be analyzing every result across the country to identify voting patterns and trends that help to give a picture of the shape of the next government.
