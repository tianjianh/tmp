Euro 2016: Who made your best XI of the group stage?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The knockout stage of Euro 2016 starts on Saturday - but who do you think have been the most impressive players so far?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
By Friday morning more than 131,000 people had selected their best XI from a long-list of the star performers in the group stage.
And here is your team of the tournament so far, slotted into what was overwhelmingly the most popular formation - 4-4-2.
It was an extremely close-run thing in several positions - Northern Ireland goalkeeper Michael McGovern, currently without a club - was selected 33,000 times, 1,000 more than Germany's Manuel Neuer.
Germany's Jerome Boateng was the most popular pick in the centre of defence with 55% of people naming him. Italy's Leonardo Bonucci was second, just ahead of Azzurri and Juventus team-mate Giorgio Chiellini.
England midfielder Eric Dier and Croatia's impressive wide man Ivan Perisic were extremely unlucky to miss out - both just 1,000 selections shy of Germany's Toni Kroos.
But by far the most popular pick was Gareth Bale, selected in 95% of teams, followed by France's West Ham forward Dimitri Payet, who appeared in 88% of your selections.
Three players from the home nations made it into the XI - and all are back in action over the next few days.
