You wanted to know why there were so many elephants around Coventry.
You asked if a hill fort in Shropshire had ever been excavated and if the University of Birmingham had once used its coal mines as bomb shelters.
We were asked about the fate of two hospitals in Staffordshire. Here's how we answered your questions.
All around the city symbols of elephants can be spotted on crests, windows and pillars.
Coventry's sports centre is even known as The Elephant due to its colour and shape.
Midlands Today reporter Joan Cummins explored some of the city's elephants with local historian Pete Walters.
A project called Walking with Elephants is planned as part of Coventry's bid for City of Culture 2021.
Historic England says the site, which it calls Pan Castle, is believed to be all that remains of a motte and bailey castle. It has been given Scheduled Ancient Monument status by the government because it is a well preserved example of one of these earthworks, introduced to Britain by the Normans.
The only known excavation of the site was carried out by soldiers in 1916 and Shropshire Council's historic environment manager, Andy Wigley, believes they were troops stationed at the large Prees Heath camp.
The dig uncovered the remains of a bridge, but Historic England believes that "extensive buried remains of structures" probably still survive under the ground, along with "artefacts and organic remains".
Well, earlier this year, health bosses closed two wards containing 47 beds at Cheadle Community Hospital, saying they hoped it would enable more patients to recover at home.
The North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) says neither Cheadle Community or Leek Moorlands hospitals themselves are due to close.
At the Leek site, the CCG says there is currently work under way to seek people's views about the number of beds - adding that no closure decision would be taken "without full public consultation".
We got in touch with Luke Harrison at the university to do some digging.
He said: "I know there is certainly discussion about provision of air raid shelters, including references in the wonderful diaries of Sir Raymond Priestley, Vice Chancellor and in the minutes of the Finance and General Purposes committee.
"I haven't found any references to the mines being used in the catalogue listings we have so far and I would have expected to see this noted as a point of interest.
"There are about a mile of phoney coalmine snakes beneath campus. It was built in 1905 to give mining students experience of working underground."
