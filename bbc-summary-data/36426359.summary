Wrexham chief executive Don Bircham has said that manager Gary Mills' transfer budget will not be affected by a shortfall of £200,000.

The National League side need the money after signing a 99-year lease to regain control of the Racecourse Stadium home.
But Bircham has denied that finances will impact on their on field goals.
"We've secured Gary's budget. The first thing we do is get that sorted. We've protected that, we've ring fenced that. Bircham told BBC Wales Sport.
He continued, "It's a budget that's competitive. It starts at the same level as last year then we work on the same principle.
"If Gary takes us beyond budgeted games, in other words the FA Cup or FA Trophy or whatever means of income he may secure like the transfer of a player, we'll then be in a position to offer him more.
"I want to reassure the fans that we have a competitive budget. Our target will always be promotion, or at least the playoffs. Gary's well aware of that target and that target stands."
Wrexham missed out on the National League play-offs in Mills' first season in charge and next season will be their ninth year outside of the Football League.
The club have so far made seven signings this summer, including the return of defender Martin Riley from Tranmere Rovers.
Mills is keen to add further new faces before the start of the campaign in August and is still awaiting news on contract offers to existing squad members Connor Jennings and Simon Heslop.
Wrexham are instead hoping to plug the gap in finances with a rise in season ticket prices, the first rise in four years, and are currently on track with sales.
"There is a shortfall that we need to balance this year and that figure we've talked to the fans about that," Bircham added.
"It's around £200,000 and we need their support with that. But moving forward it will bring great commercial streams that will benefit the football club.
"It also brings big responsibilities, significantly heavier work load, but it's wonderful to have an asset particularly our great stadium which is so historic and means so much to the fans.
"We'll see great benefits towards the end of next season."
