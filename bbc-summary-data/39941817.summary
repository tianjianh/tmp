Express Motors driver suspended after France crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A driver whose coach crashed during a school trip through France has been suspended for six weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Melvyn Lane from Porthmadog, Gwynedd, was driving for Express Motors when he went into a ditch on a motorway on 23 July last year.
Two pupils from Bournside School in Cheltenham were seriously injured, and more than a dozen others were hurt.
Lane admitted in February taking less than the compulsory nine hours of rest time before driving.
He was fined £246 plus £480 charges and costs.
Lane was investigated by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency and a hearing took place in Welshpool, Powys on Monday.
It heard Lane failed to record that he had worked a 23:30 BST to 08:00 night shift for an out of hours GP service before starting a 14:15 to 22:00 shift with Express Motors.
The Traffic Commissioner suspended his public licence until 1 July.
Express Motors of Penygroes also pleaded guilty to failing to ensure a driver had sufficient rest, and the company was fined £1,250, plus £725 charges and court costs.
