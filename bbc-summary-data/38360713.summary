[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford United 0-1 Northampton Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marc Richards struck a stoppage-time winner as Northampton snatched a dramatic derby victory over Oxford in front of a sell-out 11,790 crowd at the Kassam Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Harry Beautyman knocked Matt Taylor's corner back across goal and Richards stuck out a foot to flick the ball home at the far post.
That brought an end to Oxford's eight-game unbeaten run, but the U's only had themselves to blame with some wayward shooting and poor decision-making in the final third, as they failed to find the net at home for the first time this season.
Northampton created the better of what few chances there were in the opening hour.
Taylor's stinging shot from 20 yards was too hot to handle for U's goalkeeper Simon Eastwood but his defenders were on hand to clear.
Cobblers centre-half Lewis Nyatanga unbelievably headed a Taylor corner over the bar from just five yards.
At the other end Chris Maguire threatened from free-kicks and the Scot also forced Adam Smith into a smart save down at his right post, but Oxford struggled to get beyond the visitors' well-marshalled defence.
In the second half it was again Northampton who almost broke the deadlock, Paul Anderson somehow failing to turn in a Richards header back across the face of the goal.
