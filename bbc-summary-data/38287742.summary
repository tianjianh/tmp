[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Santokh Minhas, 67, raped the victim at his home in Shropshire, in 2015, and threatened her with repercussions if she told anyone.
He was arrested after the victim told a friend and police were notified.
Minhas, of Broadway, Shifnal, was found guilty of rape and sentenced at Hereford Crown Court on Friday.

Det Con Pauline Newton of West Mercia Police said: "Minhas exploited his victim's vulnerability with his manipulative behaviour and as a result she has suffered terribly."
Ian Willis, acting district crown prosecutor from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's rape and serious sexual offences unit, said a "dangerous sexual predator" had been brought to justice.
"The conviction of Santokh Minhas, a man who preyed on a vulnerable female, was largely down to the evidence given by the victim in court," he said.
Minhas, who was cleared of five charges of rape, was also put on the sex offenders register for an indefinite period and ordered to pay Â£2,800 in costs.
