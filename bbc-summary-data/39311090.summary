[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Delays in Welsh Government payments to hundreds of farmers is putting a strain on the farming industry in Wales, a union has warned.

The Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) said about 500 businesses were still waiting for their payments from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to be processed.
Huw Jones, of the FUW, told Newyddion 9 the delays were "unacceptable".
But the Welsh Government said no payment window had been set.
The FUW said the majority of those facing delays were in Gwynedd, with 21% of the payment holdbacks through Wales located within the authority.
In Powys 62 people were waiting for funds to be paid, with the majority promised payments by mid-January.
"The delay is unreasonable. The payments are being put through months later than the situation last year," Mr Jones said.
Tegid Jones, a Machynlleth farmer, who is waiting for his CAP payments said he was struggling financially.
He said: "Since December, I've been ringing twice a week. And I'm still none the wiser.
"I've got myself into a big hole, I've got bills and bills going out and nothing coming back in.
"The worst-case scenario is that I'll have to pack it all in."
But a Welsh Government spokesman said 97% of all claims for the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), an agricultural fund for "protecting and enhancing the countryside", had been made.
"Although the Welsh Government is committed to processing the majority of outstanding BPS claims by the end of January - there is no specified payment window," he said.
"As for Glastir, we have not made a commitment on the timing of Glastir payments. However, we aim to process them all by the end of April, except for the most complex claims."
