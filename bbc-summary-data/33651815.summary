The Shore Test Facility reactor at Vulcan in Caithness will now been cleaned up and taken apart.
Last year, the Scottish government criticised UK ministers and the MoD for its handling of a radioactive discharge at Vulcan.
The incident happened in 2012 but was not made public until early 2014.
The UK government said there were no safety concerns following the incident.
Since the late 1950s, Vulcan has been the MoD's facility for testing new designs of nuclear submarine pressurised water reactors.
It is next to, but operated separately from, the civil experimental nuclear power complex Dounreay on the north Caithness coast.
Vulcan is operated by Rolls-Royce and most of the workforce are employed by the engineering company.
Work to remove nuclear fuel and dismantle the Shore Test Facility reactor is expected to take until 2022.
Rolls-Royce said it was developing a plan for the workforce beyond that date.
In a statement it said: "Immediate tactical focus is on safe and accelerated delivery of the various preparations for the defuel and fuel movement programme.
"We are, however, progressing at increasing and appropriate aligned pace on our business planning and development for utilisation and deployment of our nuclear skills in Caithness in 2022 and beyond.
"Fundamental to this planning is ongoing flexible and informed transitional alignment to the overall Rolls-Royce submarines business demands and the UK's submarine and nuclear programmes."
