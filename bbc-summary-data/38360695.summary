[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aston Villa 2-1 Burton Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross McCormack scored the winner for an under-par Aston Villa against Burton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts took an early lead when Leandro Bacuna headed home a deep Albert Adomah cross.
Jamie Ward then levelled for the visitors with an acrobatic volley from 12 yards out.
Lloyd Dyer hit the post as Burton dominated the second half, but they were made to pay for their wastefulness when McCormack tapped home after Jordan Ayew's cross.
Defeat was harsh on the Brewers, who had the better of the game after former Villa trainee Ward levelled before the break.
They nearly salvaged a point in the last second when Mark Bunn produced a superb save from Tom Naylor's header.
Villa, who improved once Ayew had replaced Mile Jedinak, remain unbeaten at home and are now 10th in the table.
Nigel Clough's men have lost their last four league games and are two points above the relegation zone.
Aston Villa boss Steve Bruce:
"We were probably fortunate to win. We had the better chances but we found it a bit of a struggle.
"I do not think anyone who watched the match will think differently. If we are going to go forward our football has got to be better.
"We have tried to breathe a bit of life into the players. It has not been easy after the club had an awful start to the season.
Burton Albion boss Nigel Clough:
"We have produced some outstanding performances in our last four games which we have lost by the odd goal.
"It is especially galling and we do not deserve it. But that is the ruthless nature of the Championship and we have to get on with it.
"We forced their goalkeeper into a few saves, two very good ones late in the game. To come in at half-time at Villa Park having had more possession and more shots was very pleasing."
