[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two more men have been charged with the murder of another man who was found stabbed to death in his home following a suspected burglary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tony Fisher's body was found by his son in Coningswath Road in Carlton, Nottingham, on 9 January.
Jaydon Robert Barton and Nathan Barton, both 22, were charged with murder and appeared in court on Saturday.
Marcus Barton, 41, was charged with Mr Fisher's murder in January and remains in custody.
Vincent Hawkins, 32, of Handel Street, Nottingham, has also been charged with assisting an offender and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court alongside Jaydon and Nathan Barton.
Detectives believe Mr Fisher, 58, was "targeted" because it was thought he had a "large amount of money in the house".
Marcus Barton, of Raymede Drive, Bestwood, who also goes by the name Marcus Pegg, is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 13 May.
Nottinghamshire Police said officers have arrested a total of 18 people during their investigation.
Aside from the four people charged, one 42-year-old man remains on bail pending further enquiries. All others have been released without charge.
