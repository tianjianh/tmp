Swansea can end Man City's top-four dream, says Francesco Guidolin

Swansea City manager Francesco Guidolin insists his weakened side can win on Sunday and in turn ruin Manchester City's Champions League ambitions.

Defenders Ashley Williams and Neil Taylor, goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski and joint top-scorer Gylfi Sigurdsson are all rested ahead of Euro 2016, while Ki Sung-yueng is taking part in military service in South Korea.
Manchester United will finish fourth if they beat Bournemouth and City lose.
"Our players are good," said Guidolin.
Winger Jefferson Montero and striker Alberto Paloschi are also likely to be out with hamstring injuries.
Swansea's lengthy list of absentees would appear to represent grim news for Manchester United's bid to take fourth spot in the Premier League from their local rivals, and the European prize that comes with it.
Manchester City require only a point from Manuel Pellegrini's farewell fixture to guarantee incoming manager Pep Guardiola Champions League football next season.
But Swansea are in fine form with six wins in their last 10 games, and last weekend's 4-1 victory at West Ham was achieved without several of their first-team regulars.
The Welsh side, currently 11th, could leapfrog Stoke into 10th place if the Swans win and Mark Hughes' team fail to beat West Ham.
"The aim is to finish the season well with a good game against Manchester City and get a good result for our position in the table," said Guidolin, who will be in charge for the first time since signing a two-year contract to extend his stay at the Liberty Stadium.
Their late-season rise under Guidolin's command has been based on strong home form, with Norwich, Aston Villa, Chelsea and Liverpool all beaten at the Liberty Stadium since the start of March.
"I hope I can make it five home wins, but it's not simple," said the Italian.
"Manchester City are a top-four team. They are a team of great quality and they have many important players.
"We can play well on Sunday and I hope to see my team play against Manchester City like they have played in this recent period.
"To stop them getting into the Champions League is not a motivation.
"Our motivation is our target, and our target is to improve our position in the table."
