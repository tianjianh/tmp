Part of a major coastal rail route has been shut "until further notice" after cracks appeared in the sea wall over the Christmas period.

Southeastern halted services between Folkestone and Dover Priory in Kent on Christmas Eve.
It is thought the cracks in the wall at Folkestone were caused by the sea.
The operator said there had been more damage to the structure since Thursday and the line would stay closed until it was repaired.
Southeastern tweeted: "While the repairs are carried out buses will replace trains between Dover Priory and Folkestone Central."
"As soon as we receive more information we will send updates out on here with regard to the line closure between Dover and Folkestone," it continued.
"Some high-sSpeed trains will be diverted to Ramsgate via Canterbury West. You can also travel between Dover and London via Canterbury East."
