Simon Makienok volleyed in Callum Robinson's cross from inside the area to give the visitors the lead.
Aaron Wilbraham then headed in an equaliser with 12 minutes to go.
But Johnson found the net with a tame shot from a difficult angle seven minutes later as North End claimed their second win in three games.
Having held firm with the hosts dominating the early stages, North End took the lead as Makienok latched onto Robinson's cross when unmarked in the box.
The visitors should have been 2-0 up by half-time as Robinson collected Makienok's knock-down before firing a shot against the crossbar.
Tammy Abraham hit the post for City in the second half and should have done better when he headed over after Wilbraham had equalised.
But Preston claimed all three points thanks to Johnson, who beat young goalkeeper Ivan Lucic at his near post as Simon Grayson's side extended their unbeaten run against City to seven games.
Bristol boss Lee Johnson:
"We have to work through this period. It feels like Groundhog Day.
"In the first 20 minutes some of the football we played was fantastic, then we give away a really, really poor goal. Bad positioning from our back four has meant we conceded without Preston needing to produce any real quality.
"After that players who were performing at eights and nines dipped to fives and sixes. Then we managed to get ourselves back into the game, but still couldn't see it out.
"Enough is enough and tweaks need to be made. We need a couple of signings in the January transfer window to help the group.
"It's never easy in January, but I know what I want. There is a lot right and a little bit wrong at the moment, but the latter is driving me insane."
Preston North End manager Simon Grayson:
"We have had a good week, with seven points from nine and two good away performances.
"Bristol City came out of the traps fast and we had to weather the storm. We were under the cosh, but we got through it and the first goal was always going to be important.
"It was a great ball in from Callum Robinson and an excellent finish by Simon Makienok. After that I felt we looked comfortable until they equalised.
"A lot of character was shown to win the game from then on. You have to defend well because Bristol City get balls into the box and have some big lads in there.
"Christmas always means a quick turnaround of games, but we go into it with momentum. We won't get ahead of ourselves and have some tough matches coming up, but we will enjoy the next few days."
