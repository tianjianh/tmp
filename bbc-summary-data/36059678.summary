On Friday the two parties held discussions on the premise that Fianna Fáil will facilitate Fine Gael to lead the next government.
The talks centred on the parameters of those negotiations.
They were described as "constructive" by both parties.
Speaking on state broadcaster RTÉ, Minister for Defence and Agriculture Simon Coveney said "long and difficult" negotiations will take place with Fianna Fáil, but he is hopeful a minority government will be formed by the middle of next week.
On Thursday, the leaders of both parties were rejected for the third time in a vote for taoiseach.
Fine Gael's Enda Kenny, was rejected with 52 voting for and 77  against.
His rival, Fianna Fáil's Micheál Martin, was defeated with 43 votes in favour and 91 against.
