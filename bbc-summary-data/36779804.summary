Powell, 22, scored 12 goals in 41 appearances for Championship side Wigan during a loan spell in 2013-14.
He joined United for Â£3m from Crewe in 2012 and was loaned out to Leicester City and Hull City before his contract expired in June.
"He is the one player we wanted this summer and we are so happy we've got him," said Wigan boss Gary Caldwell.
