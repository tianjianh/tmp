[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan Warriors continued their 100% Super League record this season with victory over champions Leeds Rhinos in a rematch of last year's Grand Final.

Warriors dominated the first half at the DW Stadium but only led 6-0 at the break through John Bateman's try after a solo 80-metre run by Dom Manfredi.
Wigan extended the lead with scores from Oliver Gildart, Manfredi, Tony Clubb and Anthony Gelling.
Zak Hardaker's 100th career try gave struggling Leeds a late consolation.
Leeds looked on course to be without a score in a game for the first time since 1998 until Hardaker's intervention, and they remain ninth in the table, with their only victory in five league outings this season coming against Huddersfield in their previous fixture.
The Rhinos, who were 22-20 winners in last year's Old Trafford showpiece, were boosted going into Friday's game by the return of forward Jamie Jones-Buchanan after nine months out with injury.
Wigan were on top from the start, though, having Liam Farrell's early score ruled out by the video referee for an obstruction by Dan Sarginson.
But Shaun Wane's side comprehensively ran out victors to win their fifth consecutive league match this campaign, ahead of Thursday's home match against Super League leaders Widnes.
Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "We had to earn it in the first half. We tried to force it, but in the second half I thought we were ruthless. There were some good attacking plays.
"That was still a good Leeds side. I thought our back five were good and our middles were really good. It was a pleasing performance."
Leeds coach Brian McDermott: "It probably should have been about 24-0 at half-time. Wigan let us off the hook.
"I thought we were way off from the start. The absentees may have had some effect, but the nucleus of our team were off and defensively we were nowhere near (good enough).
"There comes a point in time when numerically you don't want to give yourselves a mountain to climb. I'm confident we will get where we need to be but we're not there yet."
