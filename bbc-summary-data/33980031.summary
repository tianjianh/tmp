Madeira Terraces: Seafront galleries takings 'fall 80%'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Takings are down by up to 80% this year for businesses in Brighton's Madeira Terraces after an unsafe area was cordoned off, businesses have said.

Three galleries based there said the impact had been severe.
It comes after two other businesses were asked to relocate because part of the structure was at risk of collapse.
The council said it understood concerns and would do all it could to ensure traders were not adversely affected while the arches were fenced off.
Part of the terraces were cordoned off earlier this summer, and the council has since said some of the steel and cast iron structures had corroded beyond repair.
Neil Sykes, of Modern World Gallery, said visitors had been forced away by both the fence and parking arrangements that took people to the seaside, not the galleries.
Andy Doig, of Neon Studios, said his business tried to project itself with a beautiful, neat frontage, but the area was now littered with cement mixers and building equipment. He said hoardings were going up that pushed the gallery into a corner, and people only saw a building site.
At Honeysett Gallery, Steve Honeysett said footfall was almost zero now and the effect had been dramatic.
"From the established traders that have been here, we're talking 75%, 80% down on their footfall trade," he said.
A council spokeswoman said measures to support traders had already been agreed, along with parking and road layout changes to make the area safer for residents and visitors.
She said the metal fencing would be replaced with a permanent anti-climb transparent fence at the end of the summer.
"We are happy to explore the idea of local artists decorating it but, in the interests of security, we must ensure it remains reasonably transparent so there are no hidden areas," she said.
