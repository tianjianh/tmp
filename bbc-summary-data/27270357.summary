Paulo Ricardo Gomes da Silva was struck as clashes took place near one of the entrances to Arruda stadium.
Another three people were reportedly hurt as toilet bowls were ripped out of stadium facilities and hurled at rival fans below.
Recife is one of the host cities of the World Cup, due to start on 12 June.
But the matches will be hosted at another stadium in Recife, the Arena Pernambuco, which has been especially built for the tournament.
Brazil's football association decided on Saturday to ban matches in the Arruda stadium until a court of sport has ruled on the case.
The clashes took place on Friday night after local side Santa Cruz drew 1-1 with Parana, from southern Brazil.
The visiting side's fans were leaving the stadium when the toilet bowls were thrown out of the upper tiers of the Arruda stadium.
Police had told the visiting fans to leave the stadium earlier to avoid clashes, local reports said. But they were ambushed by a faction of the Santa Cruz fans.
An investigation has begun into the incident. Earlier this year, Santa Cruz supporters hurled toilet bowls at fans of their local rivals, Sport.
