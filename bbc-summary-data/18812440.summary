Created by journalist Charlie Brooker, the series is a bleak look at modern society, with three vignettes looking at how technology affects our lives.
The first episode, in which a fictional Prime Minister was blackmailed into having sex with a pig, prompted 322 complaints to Ofcom and Channel 4.
But it also won a Golden Rose for best comedy at this year's Rose d'Or Television Festival.
Brooker, who wrote the opening two episodes of the first series,  
          announced its return on Twitter
.
A further three episodes have been commissioned, with filming due to start in August.
Channel 4's head of comedy, Shane Allen, said  
          in a statement
: "British drama seems particularly obsessed with murder and the past, often together. Black Mirror is a rare modern look at where society and individuals could be headed.
"Charlie Brooker exudes that same pioneering spirit of Dennis Potter and Chris Morris with their daring, complex, compelling originality."
Brooker added:  "Half of the things in the first run of Black Mirror seem to be on the verge of coming true.
"If the stories from the second run start coming true then we're REALLY in trouble."
After a heavy advertising campaign, the first series of Black Mirror averaged 1.5 million viewers across its run. It picked up a further 2.1 million views via video on demand services.
