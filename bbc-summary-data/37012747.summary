Gareth Bale: Real Madrid's Wales forward to miss Uefa Super Cup

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales forward Gareth Bale has been left out of Real Madrid's squad for Tuesday's Uefa Super Cup against fellow Spanish side Sevilla.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bale, 27, and Germany midfielder Toni Kroos have not been included after their return from an extended post-Euro 2016 break.
Portugal's Euro 2016 winners Pepe and Cristiano Ronaldo will also not feature for the Champions League winners.
Ronaldo suffered a leg injury in the Euro 2016 final win over France.
Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane has included his 18-year-old goalkeeper son Luca in the squad.
The match takes place in Trondheim, Norway.
Sevilla, who beat Liverpool to win last season's Europa League final, will be hoping there is no repeat of the 2014 Super Cup.
Two years ago in Cardiff, they lost 2-0 to Real Madrid, with Ronaldo scoring both goals.
Sevilla, in their third successive final, also lost the 2015 Super Cup 5-4 against Barcelona in Tbilisi.
