Student Anna Rhodes uncovers painting's real identity

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A student's research has uncovered a case of mistaken identity over a rare 15th Century Renaissance painting.

Anna Rhodes, an MA Art History student at The University of Manchester, discovered the real subject of the German artwork.
First displayed at West Park Museum, Macclesfield, it was titled "The Virgin Mary Releasing a Soul from Purgatory at the Intercession of King David".
But Ms Rhodes has found it was really Saint Catherine of Alexandria.
The painting was part of the inaugural exhibition of West Park Museum when it opened in 1898.
Ms Rhodes, who works as a Collections Manager for Macclesfield Museums, recognised the work's significance whilst researching for an essay.
Her tutor Dr Edward Wouk said: "This painting at West Park Museum was not forgotten but was essentially totally misunderstood and overlooked.
"Her outstanding research has changed our understanding of when the painting is made, where it was made, for whom it was made, and crucially, what it represents."
The painting depicts Saint Catherine of Alexandria, who is also known as Saint Catherine of the Wheel.
It is thought the panel, which was painted by an unknown artist in Nuremberg, would have been part of a larger altar piece dedicated to Saint Catherine, who was martyred in the early 4th Century at the hands of Emperor Maxentius.
Anna Rhodes continued: "When the painting came into the museum's collection in 1898 it was titled 'The Virgin Mary Releasing a Soul from Purgatory at the Intercession of King David'. This had never been questioned and the panel was displayed throughout much of the last century with this interpretation.
"My research shows the painting to actually depict Saint Catherine and the burning philosophers and to originate from the Nuremberg region of Germany."
The museum's oldest painting will be back on display in November.
