US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has reacted angrily after a leading golf tournament was moved from one of his courses to Mexico.

The PGA Tour said it could not find sponsors to hold the 2017 World Golf Championship at Mr Trump's Doral course in Miami.
Mr Trump said the PGA had "put profit ahead of thousands of American jobs".
On the campaign trail, Mr Trump has portrayed Mexico as undermining the US economy.
Understanding the media addiction to Trump
Why has Trump caught Clinton in the polls?
PGA Tour commissioner Timothy Finchem said Mr Trump's current profile had made it "difficult" to attract sponsors.
"It's fundamentally a sponsorship issue," said Mr Finchem.
Luxury car maker Cadillac has reportedly not renewed its sponsorship deal.
"Donald Trump is a brand, a big brand, and when you're asking a company to invest millions of dollars in branding a tournament and they're going to share that brand with the host, it's a difficult decision," he said.
However, Mr Finchem insisted the decision to move the event to Mexico City from Florida, where it has been held for the past 55 years, was not political.
"From a golf standpoint we have no issues with Donald Trump. From a political standpoint we are neutral. PGA Tour has never been involved or cares to be involved in presidential politics," he added.
The PGA Tour has signed a new seven-year sponsorship deal with Grupo Salinas, and the first WGC-Mexico Championship will held in March next year.
Mr Trump said the decision marked a "sad day for Miami, the US and the game of golf".
"This decision only further embodies the very reason I am running for president of the United States," he said.
The venue for the event has not been officially confirmed, but media reports say it will take place at the Club de Golf Chapultapec outside Mexico City.
"I hope they have kidnapping insurance," Mr Trump told Fox News.
Mr Finchem said that a member of his staff had already confirmed that this was in place.
"I haven't inquired about the detail," he said.  "But I made the point  that maybe that's something we don't want to advertise."
