World number three Murray had to play on to a second day after the contest was rained off at 4-4 on Tuesday.
The 28-year-old Scot went a break down in the second set but recovered and faces Gilles Muller of Luxembourg next.
"It was tricky conditions, very windy, completely different to yesterday. When the shadow came across it became hard to pick up the ball," said Murray.
"I lost my timing in the middle of the second set but came up with some good shots towards the end.
"I feel much better on the court. I am hitting my backhand better and it forced Tommy to slice the ball. Then I could dictate the points. It wasn't something I could do early on in the year."
Should Murray reach the final in Montreal he will replace Swiss Roger Federer as number two in the world rankings. He last held the position - the highest of his career - in 2013.
Third seed Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland went out after withdrawing with a back injury as he trailed Australian Nick Kyrgios in the third set.
Croatian US Open champion Marin Cilic also lost, beaten 6-3 6-4 by Bernard Tomic of Australia.
Fourteenth-seed Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria was beaten 5-7 7-6 (7-5) 7-5 by unseeded American Jack Sock, who now plays top seed Novak Djokovic.
Spanish seventh seed Rafael Nadal beat Ukrainian Sergiy Stakhovsky 7-6 (7-4) 6-3, while fourth seed Kei Nishikori of Japan went through with a 6-3 6-3 win over Spain's Pablo Andujar.
