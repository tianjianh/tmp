[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 3-1 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Gray's second-half double earned struggling Hartlepool a comeback win over promotion-chasing Leyton Orient.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The O's started strongly and deservedly led when Bradley Pritchard's strike found the bottom corner of the net.
But Pools were level after 20 minutes, Kudus Oyenuga scoring a penalty following Alan Dunne's handball.
The visitors continued to create the better chances, but Gray's long-range shot went in via Dunne to make it 2-1 and another Gray strike sealed victory.
It was on-loan Crystal Palace teenager Gray's first Pools goals in his second appearance and was harsh on Orient, who could have gone fourth with a win.
They dominated the first half with John Marquis going close, while Mathieu Baudry also had a close-range header saved by Pools keeper Trevor Carson after the interval when the score was still 1-1.
But Hartlepool, who remain 18th but are now 10 points clear of the relegation places, finished strongly and took the points thanks to Gray's fortunate first and calm 12-yard effort with five minutes left.
