Budget 2015: Top tax rises in the Budget

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chancellor George Osborne faced a tricky challenge when trying to raise taxes in this Budget, which was that his party had already promised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
That left him having to raise some of the less well-known taxes.
There's an honourable mention for the bringing forward of payments of corporation tax, which raises an impressive £4.5bn in 2017-18, but by the end of the parliament it would be raising very small amounts.
So, here are the top four tax increases, ranked according to the amount of money the Treasury reckons they will raise in 2020-21.
Did you know all of these taxes even existed?
Top of the pile is the change to the way dividends on shares are taxed.
The government is doing away with the current system of dividend tax credit in favour of a tax-free allowance. The first £5,000 someone earns in dividends will be tax-free.
After that, any dividend income will be taxed at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers.
And the Treasury reckons that will raise just under £2bn in 2020-21.
Second on the list is the rise in insurance premium tax.
From November, the standard rate of insurance premium tax will rise from 6% to 9.5%.
The standard rate is charged on most forms of insurance you might be considering, except for travel insurance and insurance on electrical appliances, which are charged at a higher rate of 20%. There are also some forms of insurance that are exempted, such as long term insurance products including life insurance and any forms of reinsurance.
The hike in tax rates will raise about £1.5bn a year for the Exchequer.
Vehicle excise duty (VED) is what you used to know as your tax disc before they were abolished.
At the moment there are lots of different bands of charges.
For cars registered after 1 April 2017 it will be £140 a year with a few exceptions.
Zero emission cars don't pay any VED at all.
The amounts charged in the cars' first year are divided into 13 bands depending on how much carbon dioxide they emit, from £0 for zero emission cars to £2,000 for the most polluting vehicles.
On top of that, if you have a car that had a list price of over £40,000 when new, you have to pay an extra £310 supplement on top of your standard VED for the first five years.
This one was widely mentioned during the election campaign.
At the moment, you get the tax back on any contributions you make to a pension scheme up to a limit of £40,000 a year.
From April next year, the amount you can save tax-free will fall if you are earning more than £150,000 a year.
For every £2 that you earn above that amount, you lose £1 of your tax-free pension savings allowance, down to a minimum of £10,000.
Bear in mind that these predictions of tax revenue are pretty uncertain. The OBR gives a verdict on how uncertain they are.
Pensions tax relief is rated as the most uncertain ("very high" uncertainty) because of the likelihood that high earners will change the way they save in order to avoid paying extra tax.
