A fourth man was reported missing in Cowes Harbour at about 03:00 BST, sparking a sea search by a coastguard helicopter and two lifeboats.
The search on the Isle of Wight was called off two hours later after the man was found ashore, the RNLI said.
Hampshire Constabulary is investigating the crash, involving the 6m (20ft) vessel, named the Loose Cannon.
The RNLI said the fishing or leisure craft was badly damaged and then floated down with the tide to Trinity Landing, Cowes.
A Cowes pub owner said her staff found the boat at the landing after being alerted by a man who appeared "dazed".
Anne Cook, from the Vectis Tavern, said: "We were tidying up at the end of the night when a man came in bleeding from the head saying that their boat had crashed and there was someone on it with a broken back and it was sinking."
Ms Cook said the man could not give the boat's location, but her staff managed to find it after a "long" search of several jetties.
A spokesman for Isle of Wight NHS Trust said: "The ambulance service responded overnight to an incident in Cowes harbour. Three males were conveyed to St. Mary's Hospital.
"Two of the patients have been discharged. The third patient, who has chest injuries, is stable but may need to be transferred off the island to another hospital."
