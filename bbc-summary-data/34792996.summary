Police are searching for two men who racially assaulted a 40-year-old woman and her daughter on a west London bus.

The woman was with her daughters, aged 11 and 16, when they were attacked on the U1 bus in Uxbridge, on 8 August.
The men, who were with three others, boarded the bus at Crown Walk at 19:45 GMT before getting into an argument with the mother over seating.
The pair punched the woman and her elder daughter, and racially abused all three of them.
None of the victims needed hospital treatment for their injuries.
Police described the two men as white and aged between 16 and 20 years old and said one was bare-chested at the time. The other suspect spoke with a strong Irish accent.
