Durham opener Jennings, 24, replaces Lancashire's Haseeb Hameed, 19, who will miss the remaining two Tests after breaking his left hand.
Hampshire all-rounder Dawson, 26, comes in for Zafar Ansari, who has been struggling with a back injury.
England are 2-0 down in the series with two matches to play. The fourth Test starts on 8 December.
Jennings, born in Johannesburg, captained South Africa at under-19 level. The left-hander, who is the son of former South Africa coach Ray Jennings, then served a four-year qualification period to be eligible for England.
He is set to make his England Lions debut against the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Thursday.
"Keaton's mother was born in Sunderland and at under-19 level he felt the England set-up, from a coaching and opportunities point of view, was the best in the world," Ray Jennings told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I feel blessed that the English media and fans have taken Keaton into their hearts. For me, as a father, I couldn't be more thankful.
"His heart and his love to play in the England colours is unbelievable."
Jennings made his Durham debut in 2012 and was the leading run-scorer in the 2016 County Championship with 1,548 at an average of 64.5.
He is scheduled to join the England squad in Mumbai on 5 December when they begin preparations for the fourth Test, which starts at the Wankhede Stadium three days later.
Like Jennings, Dawson was also selected for the Lions programme this winter, before being released to play for Rangpur Riders in the Bangladesh Premier League.
He made one-day international and T20 debuts for England last summer after impressing on last winter's Lions programme in the UAE. He is also expected to arrive in Mumbai early next week.
He has 130 first-class wickets at 37.47, averages 34.17 with the bat and has a highest score of 169.
Hameed was struck on the hand by India pace bowler Umesh Yadav on the first morning of the third Test, which England lost by eight wickets.
While he is going home to have a metal plate inserted in his hand, Ansari will stay with the squad and continue to receive medical support in India before returning to England on 8 December.
Meanwhile, England say they expect Chris Woakes to be fit for next week's fourth Test in Mumbai despite an X-ray showing a crack on his right thumb.
All-rounder Woakes was injured by a blow to his hand when batting in the third Test defeat at Mohali on Tuesday.
