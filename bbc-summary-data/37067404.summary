[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jonathan Hogg's injury-time goal gave unbeaten Huddersfield Town victory over Barnsley and sent the Terriers to the top of the Championship table.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Huddersfield dominated possession in the first half and took the lead when full-back Chris Lowe gathered Elias Kachunga's pass and fired in.
Barnsley equalised when Alfie Mawson headed home Marc Roberts' throw-in.
Stefan Payne shot against the post for Barnsley before Kachunga's pass found Hogg, who shot into the top corner.
The Terriers deserved their win, with Nahki Wells twice having efforts saved after the break and Rajiv van La Parra firing over from a good position.
Barnsley remain without a win at Huddersfield in more than 10 years, with their last away victory coming in May 2006.
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: "What the table says at this stage doesn't matter. We have 10 points from four matches and every single point has been deserved because of the work ethic of the players.
"It's a good run and we have to keep it going. We can only influence results with our performance.
"We can't promise a result every game but what we can promise is we will keep fighting and working hard."
Barnsley head coach Paul Heckingbottom: "It is always about the result but we came up against a good side in Huddersfield. For us to be disappointed shows how far we have come.
"It was a game of two halves for us. We didn't play well in the first half and let them dictate and didn't pose much threat.
"We responded well in the second half but we couldn't dwell on it at half-time with the players. We just came up with a new game plan. There are a lot of positives to take."
