[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sam Newns caused the two-car crash in the Maddiston area of Falkirk after driving on the wrong side of the road last September.
He pointed a crossbow in the direction of officers who caught up with him.
The 19-year-old was found to be double the legal alcohol limit at the time, and also had two knives, a saw, a machete and an axe in his possession.
Learner driver Newns, from Maddiston, pled guilty to driving dangerously, with excess alcohol and without displaying L-plates, and behaving in a threatening and abusive manner by brandishing the crossbow in the direction of police.
He also admitted possessing the loaded crossbow as an offensive weapon, and having the knives, machete, axe and a set of crossbow bolts in a public place without reasonable excuse.
Sheriff Celia Sanderson deferred sentence until 17 July for reports, telling Newns: "These are serious charges, no doubt you've had that drilled into you."
The court heard that learner driver Newns was speeding on the wrong side of the road at the time of the crash on 18 September.
His Volkswagen Golf ploughed head-on into an oncoming Mazda, leaving the driver and her two passengers injured.
Police caught up with Newns near Limerigg Primary School, on the B825 road between Slamannan in Stirlingshire and Caldercruix in North Lanarkshire.
