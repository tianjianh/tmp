The number of adults volunteering with scouts in Wales is at an all-time high, figures have shown.

The Scout Association said 4,839 adults are currently involved helping the 14,216 registered scouts.
Roles include youth workers, charity trustees and skills instructors.
But Tim Kidd, UK chief commissioner at the Scout Association, said more volunteers are needed, with more than 1,300 youngsters on the waiting list to join.
"Our adult volunteers today seek much more flexible volunteering arrangements than in the past, so that they can fit it around their busy lives," he added.
"Many adults who are signing up with the scouts have a limited amount of time to donate to us, and so we need more volunteers as a whole in order to accommodate the continued demand for scouting among young people."
Scouting has seen 12 consecutive years of growth across the UK in its youth membership and ambassador Helen Glover said volunteers were the "lifeblood" of the movement.
