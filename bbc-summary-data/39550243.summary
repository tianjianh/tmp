[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took 32 minutes before the first shot of the game, Southport's Jamie Allen firing wide with a swerving left-footed effort.
The game finally burst into life in the 62nd minute when a corner fell nicely for home defender Robbie Cundy, who fired home from close range.
The Sandgrounders doubled their lead nine minutes later when Liam Noble's right-wing cross was converted by Rory McKeown, who later struck the base of a post and Allen blazed over the rebound.
