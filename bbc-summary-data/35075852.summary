[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer has successfully given birth prematurely so she can begin intensive chemotherapy to treat cancer.

Heidi Loughlin, 32, discovered she had a rare and aggressive form of breast cancer after falling pregnant with her third child.
The discovery was made in September after she noticed a rash on her breast while feeding her baby son Tait.
Doctors gave her the option of terminating the pregnancy so she could begin aggressive chemotherapy.
But she decided to keep her baby and begin a less aggressive form of treatment so Tait and her other son Noah, aged two, would not lose their mother.
After her initial treatment failed, doctors recommended she undertook intensive chemotherapy which could save her but put her unborn baby's health at risk.
Ms Loughlin, a Metropolitan Police officer from Portishead, north Somerset, decided her only chance of survival was to give birth at 12 weeks early.
Writing on her blog, the mother-of-three said she was "absolutely thrilled" to announce the baby, a little girl, had been born safely.
"Keith and I are absolutely thrilled to announce the safe arrival of our daughter formally known as chocolate mousse," she wrote.
"She was born today via c section at 1237. She came out foot first and is breathing on her own. She weighs 2lb 5ozs. She has a Laughlin (sic) nose and she has more hair than me!!!
