[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sussex v Gloucestershire: Cameron Bancroft makes season's best score at Hove

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cameron Bancroft made only his second County Championship half-century of the season as Gloucestershire reached 150-1 against Sussex at rain-hit Hove.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following a delayed start 34 overs were bowled, in which Gloucestershire moved on from 31-0 overnight to 120-1.
After a long delay, the two teams came back out under the lights at 21:00 BST, but the visitors remained untroubled.
After 21 from Chris Dent, Bancroft got to 69 with Will Tavare still there on 43 as the visitors closed on 150-1.
Having begun the day with fears of following on, on his 50th first-class appearance, Tavare's unbroken stand of 88 with Australian Bancroft, who passed his previous season's best of 53, leaves Gloucestershire just 59 runs short of that initial target.
But against a Sussex side who are unbeaten in seven matches with Gloucestershire, there is little hope of the visitors improving on their record of just two wins from 18 visits to Hove.
