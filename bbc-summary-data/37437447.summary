The victims have been named locally as 38-year-old mother of three Maria Wallis, originally from Derry, and Kiara Baird, 19, from County Dublin.
The crash happened at about 16.15 local time outside the town of Ballybofey, on the Glenties Road.
Local Sinn FÃ©in councillor Gary Doherty, who knew the mother-of-three, said it was "absolutely tragic".
"Her son actually goes to school with my son. Last night the young people were in a state of shock," he said.
"This woman actually has three children so it is absolutely tragic that this should happen to her.
"Unfortunately we have a long history of road traffic collisions and deaths on our roads and this year has been probably more harrowing than any in recent memory.
"The community will come together at a time like this but I think the wider issues are something that we cannot allow to continue."
The cause of the single car collision is not yet known, and Irish police have appealed for witnesses.
Garda Insp Michael Harrison said: "For some reason or other the vehicle lost control, went off the road, rolled a couple of times and the two ladies unfortunately died as a result of the impact."
A man in his 40s, who was also in the car, was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
The county has seen a high number of road deaths in recent months - in July five people were killed on the roads within the space of two days.
