[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kendal man jailed after admitting child sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Cumbrian man has been jailed after admitting child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Batty, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
The charges related to two incidents on the 25 and 29 September 2014, involving the same female victim, who was based outside of the county.
Batty, of Broad Ings Crescent, Kendal, was jailed for four years at Carlisle Crown Court.
The court heard he had been disowned by his family having committed the latest in what were a "long line of sexual offences against females".
Expert assessments found he posed a "high risk" of reoffending, the court heard.
Judge Peter Hughes QC ordered that Batty should be subject to an extended licence period of four years following his release.
He will be subject to the sex offenders notification requirements for life and was also made the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.
