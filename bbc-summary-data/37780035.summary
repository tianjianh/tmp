Broken and vandalised pay and display parking meters are expected to cost Wrexham council around £164,000 in lost income.

The figure was highlighted as the local authority looks to balance its books by the end of the 2016-17 financial year.
The council said some machines had been targeted by thieves earlier this year.
More secure meters are due to be installed which will also accept payment by card and mobile phone, said a spokesman.
The authority has agreed to provide free town centre parking on council-run car parks throughout December for Christmas shoppers.
