After eight years together, Noah and the Whale have announced they are splitting up.

The five-piece say they have "decided to call it a day" and are "immensely grateful to everyone who has helped us along the way".
In a short post on the band's Facebook page, they gave special thanks to their fans.
They had released four albums, including Heart of Nowhere, which was recorded live in a handful of takes.
Their post continues: "There are too many people to mention in this short message but we would like to take this opportunity to give special thanks to all of our amazing fans, who have supported us so magnificently over the years and made everything possible."
Last November, the band also told fans that they had been "slack" on keeping them up to date with what they had been doing.
And they posted a series of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and website links to what they have been up to during their "hiatus to work on new stuff".
