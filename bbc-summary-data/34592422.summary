Lord Attenborough, who grew up in Leicester, starred in Brighton Rock and The Great Escape, and directed the Oscar winning biopic Ghandi, in 1983.
Bonhams auctioneers said the sale demonstrated the "many facets" of the late filmmaker's long life.
Other items which have gone to auction include a replica of the cane that he used in his portrayal of dinosaur creator John Hammond in Jurassic Park, in 1993.
The prop, which is topped with a mosquito trapped in amber, is expected to make between £3,000-5,000.
The sale also includes furniture and other personal pieces from the late filmmaker's London home.
Michael Attenborough, the director's son, said: "My parents had impeccable taste, they never bought anything as an investment, but simply because they loved it; and they lived by the firm conviction that beautiful surroundings had the power to humanise, to enrich one's relationship with the world."
The career of Lord Attenborough, who died in August 2014, spanned 65 years and some of the stills reflect his iconic roles, including as the gangster Pinky in Brighton Rock.
They also show him at work on the set of Ghandi, a film which took him 20 years to raise the cash to make.
The film won eight Oscars, including one for Lord Attenborough as best director.
The working screen play for the film is expected to fetch between £2,000 and 3,000.
However, a rare 1918 Charlie Chaplin film poster for A Dog's Life could go for about £15,000, it is thought.
The auction is due to conclude later on Wednesday.
