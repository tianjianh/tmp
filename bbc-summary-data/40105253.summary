The 24-year-old woman was struck on Princes Street, at its junction with Lothian Road, at about 08:30.
Police Scotland is appealing for witnesses to come forward and telling motorists to avoid the area.
The Rabbie's Tours bus had been taking passengers on a trip to the West Highlands when the incident happened.
A spokesman for the company offered their sympathies to the cyclist's family and friends.
The female driver of the minibus was "very distressed" and was at home now with her family after the tour was cancelled, he added.
He said: "We are deeply saddened by the news and our thoughts and sympathies are with the woman's family and friends.
"We are giving our full assistance to the police officers investigating the incident.
"We are also supporting our colleague involved in the incident, who is extremely shaken and upset."
It is understood the woman's bike tyre got caught in tram tracks, which caused her to topple over into the path of traffic.
The cyclist was taken to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary but police later confirmed she had died as a result of her injuries.
A City of Edinburgh Council spokesman said: "We were very saddened to hear of the tragic accident involving a cyclist and a minibus in the city centre.
"Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the young woman.
"At this time, we cannot speculate on the circumstances of the accident but we will work with Police Scotland as they continue their investigations."
