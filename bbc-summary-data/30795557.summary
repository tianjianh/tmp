All ferry services between the Channel Islands and the UK on Wednesday have been cancelled due to forecast "severe weather conditions".

The Commodore Clipper, which sails between Portsmouth and the islands has been cancelled.
A fast ferry to Weymouth, which was put on to help passengers affected by earlier disruption, was also cancelled.
On Monday, only the Clipper operated on UK routes, with fast ferries only running between Jersey and St Malo.
The forecast for Wednesday is wind rising throughout the day, reaching gale force eight to severe gale force nine in the evening. Gusts of up to 70mph overnight are predicted.
Steve Champion-Smith, executive director of freight at Condor Ferries, said: "Forecast winds are so strong that it is likely that they would prevent even our conventional ferries from berthing in the Channel Island ports, so increasing disruption.
"We expect there to be a window of less severe weather during Thursday, which we believe will enable the Clipper to berth, discharge and load cargo before the severity of the weather increases again.
"Our freight team have been in daily, detailed discussion with our customers over the past week and this revised service has been put in place with the goal of minimising disruption in these atrocious conditions."
There are no scheduled fast ferry services between the islands and the UK or France until Friday.
