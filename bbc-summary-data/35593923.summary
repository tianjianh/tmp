[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The men have all been taken by HM Coastguard helicopter to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary.
There was no information on their condition.
Bobby Thomson, 64, George Crosbie, 73, and 74-year-old Jeffrey Stewart had failed to return from a walk in the hills at Durisdeer on Tuesday.
Police and Moffat Mountain Rescue Teams carried out searches overnight in the area north of Thornhill in Dumfries and Galloway.
Driving rain and very high winds had hampered the search.
The men, who are said to be regular visitors to the Lowther Hills area of the Southern Uplands, left home at 08:30 on Tuesday for a trek and had been due to return at 15:30.
Police said the men were "experienced hillwalkers familiar with the area".
A post on the mountain rescue team's Facebook page said it had been called out by police at 19:00, with the search continuing until 02:00.
The post also described weather conditions in the area as "very wet and windy with very little visibility".
The Galloway and Tweed Valley Rescue teams have joined the search along with a coastguard rescue helicopter from Prestwick.
