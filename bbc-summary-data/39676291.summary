[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh McQuoid's close-range finish earned play-off chasing Stevenage a point in an end-to-end game at Yeovil.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two minutes before the break, Yeovil went close as Akpa Akpro's goalbound effort was superbly blocked by Dean Wells.
But the forward did get his name on the scoresheet on the stroke of half-time as he volleyed home Otis Khan's cross.
Stevenage were level eight minutes after half-time when McQuoid tapped home from close-range after a corner was not cleared.
Boro were on top and Steve Schumacher then forced Jonny Maddison into a good low save before the Yeovil goalkeeper parried Jobi McAnuff's powerful drive.
At the other end, Akpro robbed Jack King of the ball before squaring it to Francois Zoko, but the striker's flicked finish crept agonisingly wide.
Tom Pett's shot was parried as Stevenage searched for a winner.
With seven minutes left, Maddison made another crucial stop from substitute Jamie Gray after he was put through one-on-one, but Stevenage had to settle for a draw which leaves them one place and one point outside the play-offs.
