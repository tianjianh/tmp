Table tennis coach Matthew Morris admits sex acts with girl

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A table tennis coach has admitted engaging in sexual activity with a teenage girl he met at a tournament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew Morris, 29, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, travelled to hotels in Glasgow between July and November 2013 to meet the 15-year-old girl.
He was caught after colleagues at the English Table Tennis Association reported their concerns to police.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, sentence on Morris was deferred for background reports and his bail was continued.
He was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
The court heard that Morris and the schoolgirl - who cannot be named for legal reasons - met at a tournament in Liverpool when he was 27 and she was 14.
It was heard that when she was 15 "they became involved".
Other members of staff at the Table Tennis Association found out and the police were contacted.
Morris was questioned by police in March 2014 before being released.
When police later analysed the girl's phone, they found 10 pictures involving Morris.
Some showed them on beds kissing while others were pictures of his body that he had sent to her.
