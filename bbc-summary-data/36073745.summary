Johnson's team's second-tier status was ensured when they drew 2-2 at Blackburn and Milton Keynes Dons were relegated.
Chief operating officer Mark Ashton has said the club will "leave no stone unturned" as they look for new players.
"You couldn't name a player in Europe that we don't know their situation," Johnson told BBC Radio Bristol.
"We have a big summer ahead. That's the fun bit - the team-building process. It's exciting.
"We have got a bit of room to wriggle because our loans go back.
"We've got a good recruitment system - a decent scouting network of experienced scouts.
"I've got my ideas in the way we want to play and we'll recruit around that."
