Sheep stolen from North Yorkshire moorland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Around 100 sheep have been stolen from moorland near Ingleton on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales national park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hog horned sheep were taken from land near the foot of the Ingleborough mountain.
Police said the theft happened sometime between 16 April and 20 May.
The sheep have two red markings on the middle of their backs and have the letters JN on one horn and the letter C and a crown on the other horn.

Insp Jon Grainge said: "The difficulty with the nature of this crime is that it is not necessarily immediately obvious to farmers, who may only be able to identify their shortfall at the time of bringing sheep in to scan or to worm, which often gives a very wide timeframe for us to work with.
"Lines of inquiry are limited, and this is where we need the public's help to call in suspicious movements of animals, or animals appearing in fields unexpectedly."
