[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglers who argued endangered fish in a Snowdonia lake should be better protected have lost the latest round in a legal fight with an environmental body.

They claimed treated discharge from a water treatment works degraded the quality of Llyn Padarn, Llanberis.
The group lost a judicial review, after claiming Natural Resources Wales (NRW) had failed to protect Arctic charr at the Gwynedd lake.
They appealed but it has been rejected.
After losing their initial challenge in December, Seiont, Gwyrfai and Llyfni Anglers' Society appealed the decision during a Court of Appeal hearing in London in July.
The row was sparked after the anglers sent a notification to NRW, claiming the lake was suffering "environmental damage" as a result of discharges from Llanberis Sewage and Waste Water Treatment Works.
And they challenged NRW's response to their allegations on a number of points.
NRW considered the claims of the anglers but maintained there had not been "environmental damage" to the site, the Arctic charr or any other relevant species.
Three appeal court judges, headed by Lord Justice Lindblom, dismissed the anglers' renewed challenge in a written judgment handed down on Monday.
