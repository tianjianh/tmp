Southwold mayor Melanie Tucker said her chain of office, from the 1800s, was taken along with those of her consort and deputy over the weekend.
They were stolen from Southwold Town Hall.
Ms Tucker told the BBC: "The town hall has been violated by people who have broken in and who appear to have known what they were looking for."
Suffolk Police said thieves forced entry via the rear of the building on Market Place and made "an untidy search" before taking the three civic chains.
Ms Tucker said: "The mayor's chain is a splendid item with discs on it that show the mayors' names over the years - it is a formal ceremonial chain and something that is very precious to us.
"The boxes that the chains were stored in were ripped off the wall so there has been some damage, but fortunately no damage to individuals."
Police said the break-in happened at some point between Friday and Monday.
