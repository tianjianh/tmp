Actor Johnny Depp's dogs are preparing to leave Australia to evade a death threat, the country's agriculture minister has said.

Barnaby Joyce had said Boo and Pistol would have to be put down by Saturday if they did not leave, because they were "snuck in" from the US.
Mr Joyce told the BBC he believed they were leaving by private jet on Friday, which he said was "the wisest move".
But he has also expressed concerns the dogs could now be left stateless.
"The question is if he breached our laws, then did he follow the correct laws in the US?" Mr Joyce told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"My worry is will the US let them back in? If not ... will they have anywhere to go?"
Johnny Depp is living in Australia while filming the fifth instalment of the Pirates of the Caribbean films.
He and his wife Amber Heard are accused of not declaring the Yorkshire Terriers to customs officials when they flew into Queensland by private jet last month.
Australia has strict import laws to prevent non-native diseases entering the country.
The fate of the dogs has gripped Australia and world media.
An online petition calling on Mr Joyce to spare them now has more than 17,000 signatures and it sparked a debate about the #waronterrier on Twitter.

"I get that Johnny Depp broke the law by not telling someone about his dogs but the response is death? That's the largest over-reaction ever," said Alexis Rogers on Facebook.
Facebook user Bree Graham MacTaggart agreed: "They don't have to kill the dogs. They could just quarantine them."
Others, however, did not express much sympathy for the Hollywood actor.
"Very disappointed that Johnny Depp has acted so irresponsibly - he flouted the law," said Facebook user Rebecca Gracey.

The dogs should have been properly checked and certificated and then quarantined after arriving in Australia.
Their illicit entry appears to have been uncovered after a grooming salon on the Gold Coast posted pictures of them on its Facebook page.
Mr Joyce said on Thursday: "If we start letting movie stars even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody?
"It's time that Pistol and Boo buggered off back to the United States."
Mr Joyce meanwhile had demanded an apology from a radio presenter who accused him of over-reacting.
Kiis FM "shock jock" Kyle Sandilands told Mr Joyce in an angry telephone interview on Friday that he sounded "like an absolute clown" who made Australians "sound like a bunch of hillbilly redneck losers" by publicly threatening the life of someone's pets.
"Sound like a classy guy.  You're a government minister. Have some decency."
Mr Joyce replied "it's the law, mate; that's how it works," before he was cut off.
Customs officials are facing questions over how the dogs were let in despite the strict regulations, while Depp and Heard could face a fine.
