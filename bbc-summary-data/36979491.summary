Simon Day, who has previously appeared in The Fast Show, plays Garnett in the show, which is part of the Lost Sitcoms series.
The character was originally portrayed by Warren Mitchell, who died in November..
Steptoe and Son and Hancock's Half Hour are also being revived.
The BBC is re-shooting episodes of post-war sitcoms of which no recordings survive, as they are missing from its archives.
The special episodes are being recreated by a new cast using the original scripts in front of a studio audience.
The Lost Sitcoms series will air later in the year to mark 60 years since Hancock's Half Hour first appeared on BBC TV.
