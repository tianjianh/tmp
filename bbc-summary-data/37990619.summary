Police have made a fresh appeal for help in tracing a Glasgow woman who has been missing for four weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Janet McQueen, 58, has not been seen since 18 October when she left her home in the city's Govanhill area.
The latest appeal came as members of her family visited Cathcart Police Station to see the inquiry team.
Insp Alex Hutton said he wanted to "reassure" Ms McQueen's family during a "distressing time". He asked anyone with information to come forward.
Ms McQueen was last seen in Langside Road in Govanhill at about 22:00 on 18 October.
She is described as white, 5ft tall, of slim build with short black hair. She was wearing glasses, a navy blue anorak and dark-coloured trousers.
Insp Hutton said: "Janet has now been missing for four weeks and her family and friends are extremely worried abut her. It is totally out of character for her to be out of touch for this length of time and there are real concerns for her wellbeing.
"This must be a very distressing time for them and we wanted to take this opportunity to invite her family into the incident room today to reassure them that we are doing everything we can to find her.
"Our dedicated officers are based in this incident room, taking calls with information about potential sightings of Janet and acting on that information to ensure all lines of inquiry are exhausted."
Insp Hutton added: "I would continue to appeal to members of the public to come forward with any information they may have regarding Janet 's whereabouts.
"No matter how insignificant you think it may be, please let us know so that officers can make that judgement."
