Sturgeon says SNP still to decide on second independence referendum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP is still to decide if a second referendum on independence will be in its 2016 Holyrood election manifesto.

It comes after Alex Salmond said he believed a second vote was "inevitable"
Scottish Secretary David Mundell then urged the Scottish government to clarify its position on another vote.
Ms Sturgeon said it would be her "ultimate decision", with party backing, but it would be made based on the country's "best interests".
Speaking on a visit to China, Ms Sturgeon said: "There can't be a referendum, and there certainly can't be independence for Scotland, unless a majority of people in Scotland clearly want that.
"It will be my ultimate decision, in line with the democratic decision making processes of the SNP, to determine whether or not there is a commitment to a second referendum in the SNP manifesto for the Scottish election.
"And in due course we will take that decision and take that decision based on what we consider to be in the best interests of the country."
The first minister said she believed "one day" there would be another independence referendum, but that it required a change in circumstances from last year's vote.
She added: "But whether it's the next Scottish election or a subsequent Scottish election - it's the decision of the SNP whether or not to include it in a manifesto, but it is the decision of the Scottish people whether to vote for that manifesto."
Mr Mundell, the Scottish secretary in the Uk government, earlier said that there were no contingency plans for a further referendum after next year's Holyrood elections - after being asked about any departmental plans in parliamentary questions by an SNP MP.
On Sunday, Alex Salmond said a second referendum was inevitable with the issue "a question of timing", a spokeswoman for Ms Sturgeon said there was "no difference of opinion" between the first minister and Mr Salmond.
Scottish voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% in last September's referendum.
After the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in May's general election, Ms Sturgeon stressed there was "no second Scottish independence referendum on the immediate horizon".
However, with some opinion polls pointing to the possibility of an SNP landslide in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections there has been speculation a second vote could be on the cards.
Margaret Ferrier, the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, submitted two written questions on the issue to the Scottish secretary.
She asked "what contingency plans his department has prepared for the possibility of a further referendum on Scottish independence being the policy of the Scottish government after the Scottish Parliament election in 2016".
Mr Mundell said he was "disappointed" by the questions in light of previous statements made by both Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor Mr Salmond that the referendum was a "once-in-a-generation" opportunity.
In response, Mr Mundell said: "My department has not prepared contingency plans for the possibility of a further referendum being the policy of the Scottish government after the Scottish Parliament election in 2016."
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme, the Tory MP said he did not accept that circumstances had changed since the referendum.
He accused the SNP of trying to find "an excuse" to have another vote.
He said: "I think Nicola Sturgeon needs to be much clearer. Is it the SNP policy to have a second referendum or not?
"It is clear from what Alex Salmond is saying that this isn't about the Smith Commission. For Alex Salmond the Smith Commission isn't good enough, it is independence or nothing and that's what is underlying the push for the second referendum."
The Smith Commission was set up after the independence referendum last year to consider further powers for the Scottish Parliament.
The Scotland Bill, currently making its way through parliament at Westminster, is taking forward its recommendations.
Labour's only Scottish MP and shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray told BBC Radio Scotland: "Given that everyone agreed, and Nicola Sturgeon agreed, that we shouldn't have another referendum in a generation I think she should keep her promise on that.
"If she is going to keep that promise, it would be strange for them to have that in a manifest, to say they would deliver it over the next Scottish parliamentary period.
"The first minister has to clear this up."
