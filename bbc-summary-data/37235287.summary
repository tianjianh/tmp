A signal failure at Lewisham caused delays on commuter services on the Southeastern rail franchise.
A second problem with the points on the track just outside Charing Cross station also disrupted services.
Network Rail said delays would continue into the afternoon but that both issues had been fixed.
Southeastern rail said it expected services to be restored by Wednesday evening's rush hour.
The disruption comes two days after the new concourse at London Bridge Station opened.
Commuters have also complained that railway platforms have become narrower since the station's refurbishment.
Pre-planned engineering work also means trains are unable to stop at Cannon Street.
Trains to Cannon Street are being diverted to Victoria, Blackfriars and New Cross all week as part of the planned engineering works.
A joint statement from Southeastern railways and Network Rail said: "We are very sorry for the delays passengers experienced this morning due to signalling problems between Lewisham and London Charing Cross.
"Both of these issues have been fixed by Network Rail engineers. However, there are still delays to services as they recover.
"We are working hard to recover services and tickets are being accepted on alternative routes"
