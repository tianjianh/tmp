Royal Marine reservist jailed over arms sales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Royal Marine reservist has been jailed for a string of firearms offences, including stockpiling stolen guns and ammunition to sell on the black market.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Martin Shannon, 43, from Hythe, near Southampton, used his training to steal and bury the weapons.
He was caught after selling ammunition, grenades and other munitions to an undercover officer for Â£5,000.
He was jailed for 14 years and six months.
In a hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday 14 October, Shannon admitted selling a prohibited weapon, possessing a shortened shotgun, possessing seven high explosive grenades and purchasing 1,400 rounds of ammunition.
Shannon, who was based at RM Poole naval base in Dorset, became the subject of a covert operation after intelligence suggested he had been stockpiling weapons.
