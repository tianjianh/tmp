The Wanlip site currently uses equipment from the 1960s to treat sewage sludge and produce gas which provides power for the site.
Local residents will be able to view the plans at an open exhibition at Wanlip Village Hall on 23 April.
A planning application will be submitted in late May or early June this year.
The replacement of the old Wanlip digestion plant is a "key strategy for efficiently dealing with sewage sludge" and improving renewable gas production, a Severn Trent Spokesman said.
Dale Collison, project manager for Severn Trent Water, said: "Severn Trent can generate a form of clean energy by harnessing the methane that is created when sewage sludge breaks down."
The methane gas from millions of litres of sewage from the Wanlip site is converted into electricity.
