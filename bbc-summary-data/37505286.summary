[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby-shaking woman faces jail for leaving boy disabled

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted shaking a seven-month-old baby so severely she left him disabled.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nikki Irvine faces up to five years in prison for injuring the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
She had been charged with assaulting the baby at a house in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, in 2013.
The 29-year-old eventually pleaded guilty at Paisley Sheriff Court to an amended charge of causing his injuries by culpable and reckless conduct.
Irvine, who walks with the aid of two crutches, showed no emotion in the dock as she pleaded guilty to leaving the boy disabled.
The court heard that a civil case involving Irvine, from Johnstone, and the child had been heard at the court earlier.
Sentence was deferred to allow the sheriff involved in that case to deal with Irvine.
