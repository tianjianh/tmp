Fifa scandal: Around the world in football investigations

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Since the US announced charges against nine Fifa officials last week, the floodgates seem to have opened and countries across the globe have launched their own probes. What are some of the most significant and what are they focused on?

When it comes to allegations of corruption made against Fifa, there have been many tremors. But this was the earthquake.
Last week, officials from the US Department of Justice and the FBI announced charges against nine top Fifa officials and five businessmen following a multi-year investigation. Seven officials were rounded-up in Switzerland where they were meeting ahead of the 65th Fifa Congress.
This investigation centred on Concacaf and Conmebol - the football confederations governing North America and South America, respectively.
It was alleged that officials from the two football confederations conspired in a "systematic payment of bribes and kickbacks" that were paid by marketing executives who wanted preferential treatment in the awarding of rights to market and sell media access to football tournaments.
The investigation is on-going, and the New York Times reports that "authorities say more charges are all but certain".
The US investigation snared individuals and organisations across the globe, including three Brazilian nationals and the Confederacao Brasileira de Futebol (CBF) - the country's football confederation.
Among those taken into custody at a five-star hotel in Zurich last Wednesday was Jose Maria Marin, who led the CBF until April, and who served on several Fifa standing committees. Prosecutors allege that he and several of the other defendants were paid a bribe as they decided how to award the media rights to the Copa America.
There were also allegations that an unnamed sportswear company paid bribes in the mid-1990s to sweeten a deal to that would see it supply Brazil's iconic yellow and green jerseys, among other equipment.
In the wake of these, Brazil's federal police began investigations into possible Fifa corruption in the country.
Justice Minister Eduardo said they were investigating possible tax evasion and money laundering within Brazil.
This week, Brazil's Federal Senate voted to begin its own investigation into the CBF and the 2014 World Cup.
Last year's tournament cost the host country Brazil an estimated $4bn (Â£2.6bn), and yet Fifa made more than $2bn in profit.
President Dilma Rousseff said Brazilian Football "will only benefit" from the US investigation.
Separately, authorities in Costa Rica have opened an enquiry into US allegations against Eduardo Li, who was charged last week and who used to lead Costa Rica's football association.
Mr Li's arrest on Wednesday was met with surprise in Costa Rica. He was widely lauded after the Costa Rican national team's unexpected run to the quarter-finals of last year's World Cup.
The investigation "aims to determine whether the hypothesis of the US Department of Justice probe related to a case of money laundering and corruption involving Eduardo Li can be corroborated," said a spokesman for Costa Rica's public prosecutor.
Costa Rica's tax office has also said that it was opening an investigation into Mr Li's various businesses in the country.
Meanwhile, a judge in Argentina issued arrest warrants for three businessmen who are wanted by US authorities.
And the Argentine Football Association (AFA) was vocally supportive of the US-led investigation.
The AFA "support and joins the investigations on Fifa and Conmebol representatives and members," it said in a statement.
In the hours after the US-based charges were announced, Swiss authorities launched their own, separate probe.
Their investigation focuses on the bidding process and the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Swiss police raided Fifa's headquarters in Zurich and seized electronic evidence.
The case is still at the investigative stage, but could provide allegations about the allocation of future World Cups.
The investigation marks the first time that authorities with the ability to prosecute have looked into the bidding process.
One key point to keep in mind, however, is that the Swiss have made it clear that Fifa are the "injured party", and are investigating individuals who may have abused their status and authority during the bidding process.
After the allegations came to light, British officials started to ask questions about how the scandal may have touched their shores.
John Whittingdale, the culture, media and sport secretary, said the government will do "all in its power" to affect change at Fifa.
Labour's shadow culture minister, Chris Bryant, has accused British prosecutors of failing to investigate corruption in world football, and said British authorities were "lax" when it came to tackling financial crime.
Mr Bryant wrote to the prime minister asking him to call a meeting of the British football associations, sponsors and broadcasters so that they could agree a common approach towards Fifa, as many Europeans call for a boycott of the World Cup.
Meanwhile, the BBC has come to understand that Standard Chartered and Barclays - two UK banks that were named in FBI papers - have launched internal reviews into whether they were used for corrupt payments by Fifa officials.
