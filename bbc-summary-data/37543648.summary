Greater Ardoyne Residents Collective (GARC) supporters, including spokesperson Dee Fennell, confronted the high-profile priest after the Orange Order Parade passed the Ardoyne shops.
A small crowd of protesters accused him of taking sides with Sinn FÃ©in and the Orange Order against a majority of local residents.
Fr Donegan has ministered in the Ardoyne area for the last 15 years, and is due to take up new duties next week at the Tobar Mhuire retreat centre in Crossgar.
