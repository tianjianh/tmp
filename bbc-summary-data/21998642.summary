Police said Ryan Harrison, from Woking, was with a friend at Guildford station at 23:40 GMT on Saturday when he became involved in the confrontation which involved a number of other men.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Harrison, 22, was fatally injured by a train.
Three men were arrested on suspicion of murder and later released on bail.
In a statement issued through British Transport Police, Mr Harrison's family said: "Ryan was the biggest, brightest ray of sunshine for us. He loved life, his family and his friends."
The family paid tribute to a brother, son and boyfriend who they said they were lucky to have had in their lives.
The statement continued: "He always looked so smart and gorgeous. He was ambitious in life and loved to party. He was a true sun worshipper and always had to have a tan.
"His family have been totally devastated by his loss, and we ask to be left in peace and given time to grieve.
"We would like to thank everyone for their kind words and tributes - we take strength from seeing how much he was loved by everyone that knew him.
"He had the biggest, kindest heart, and a bright light has been turned off in all of us that knew and loved him."
South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedics attended the incident but Mr Harrison was pronounced dead at the scene.
Two 19-year-old men from Guildford were arrested at the scene while a third man, from Cranleigh, handed himself into a police station in Guildford later.
All three have been released until a date in May while police inquiries continue.
Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death and are examining CCTV footage.
Det Ch Insp Iain Miller, senior investigating officer, said: "Our thoughts remain with Ryan's family as they try to come to terms with what happened.
"This is clearly a very painful and difficult time for them."
The station was cordoned off until the early hours of Sunday morning while forensic officers conducted a search.
Mr Miller added they were treating the death as suspicious and asked anyone who was at the station at the time to contact police.
