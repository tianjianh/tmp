An exhibition, marking 25 years since the appearance of one of the world's most famous crop circles, has opened.

The Eastfield Pictogram at Alton Barnes near Devizes was first spotted in July 1990 and led to a new era of interest in studies of the formations.
The south west of England, especially Wiltshire, remains the "unquestioned homeland" of the patterns, which appear every summer in farmers' fields
At least 15 formations have been spotted so far this year in the county.
Although most crop circles are acknowledged to be manmade, there is still a feeling among believers that they are caused by something unexplained.
Monique Klinkenbergh from the Crop Circle Access Centre said the subject deserves recognition and serious scientific research.
"Not all circles are man-made," she said.
"After seven years of studying the subject, and having experienced unexplainable things myself, I know there is more going on than just people with planks and ropes."
Ms Klinkenbergh said the free exhibition would present "unknown facts" about the "authentic, mysterious and misunderstood phenomenon".
"Another major aim is to bring the concerns of the farming community to the attention of the general public and an attempt to find a workable solution to help those farmers who are willing to allow access to visitors who often travelled long distances to Wiltshire to experience the phenomenon," she said.
The free exhibition, at St. Peter's Church in Marlborough, will run until 28 August.
