About 70 mourners gathered at Mexborough Cemetery in Doncaster for the funeral of 92-year-old Royal Navy veteran Douglas Barratt on Wednesday, but were locked out for 40 minutes.
The digger, used by gravediggers, then forced open the doors of the chapel.
A Doncaster Council spokesman said they were "very sorry" for what happened.
