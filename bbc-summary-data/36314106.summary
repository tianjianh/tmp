[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wigan went level on points with Warrington, Catalans Dragons and Hull FC at the top of the Super League table with a Magic Weekend win over Leeds.

Kallum Watkins gave the bottom-of-the-table Rhinos an early lead but Willie Isa's first two Wigan tries put them 12-4 ahead at the break.
George Williams, Dom Manfredi and Ben Flower put the Warriors in control before Mitch Achurch pulled one back.
But Oliver Gildart and Dan Sarginson went over late on to wrap up the win.
Wigan's victory, complete with their biggest points haul of the season, leaves four teams separated by only points difference at the top of the table, although Catalans and Hull both have the opportunity to take over as leaders if they beat Wakefield and Hull KR respectively on Sunday.
Shaun Wane's Warriors came into the game - a re-match of last season's Grand Final won by Leeds - having suffered back-to-back league defeats but knowing that they had not been beaten at Magic Weekend since 2008.
And once they went in front they proved too good for the out-of-sorts Rhinos, whose nightmare season since winning the treble last year shows no signs of ending.
Leeds, who were without 10 regulars through injury and suspension, have now lost five successive games in all competitions and defeat leaves them six points away from eighth-placed Widnes in the race for a top-eight finish before the league splits.
Leeds coach Brian McDermott:  "It was a tough way to lose, a tough scoreline. Obviously the crucial part was just after half-time but before then the game was a contest.
"I thought we gave it absolutely everything. We kept on having a crack, probably over-played a bit.
"There was another chunk of effort this week. We're clearly hamstrung with players missing and what's gone on in pre-season and you get to the stage when things don't go your way.
"But quietly there are some positives. I think there is something special to be done for us at the end of the year.
"Your objectives shift as weeks go by and you keep losing games. I don't think I'm giving up on the Grand Final - I know numerically we might just be out of touch at the moment.
"But there is something there to work with, something good for the future. These young fellas are learning some lessons."
Wigan coach Shaun Wane: "I thought we played well for 40 minutes. We started well in both halves and were ruthless but then we got a bit bored and went away from it.
"I have to say there is loads of spirit in the Leeds team, there is no question about that. They have a competitive coach and competitive players."
