Aaron Dundon: Ulster appoint former Leinster hooker as scrum coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster have added Grenoble forwards coach Aaron Dundon to Les Kiss' backroom team.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dundon has been appointed scrum coach and will join an Ulster set-up that includes new head coach Jono Gibbes and new assistant coach Dwayne Peel.
New Zealander Dundon, 35, made 49 appearances for Leinster as hooker after joining the province in 2010.
Dundon coached All-Ireland League club Clontarf before joining Grenoble, where he worked as interim joint head coach.
This was following Irishman Bernard Jackman's exit earlier this year.
"Aaron is a very good technical coach who relates well to the modern challenges of the scrum," said Kiss.
"He will also be a resource for our line out throwers and will assist with our skill development.
"He has worked under some of the best coaches in the game, such as Greg Feek, Joe Schmidt, Matt O'Connor, Leo Cullen and Bernard Jackman.
"He has an astute analytical brain and I'm excited to see him working alongside Jono in building on our forwards game, especially with our young front row players such as Kyle McCall and Ross Kane."
Dundon, who worked with Gibbes during his time at Leinster, described his move to Ulster as a "fantastic opportunity".
"I'm enthusiastic about where we can take the club and am looking forward to getting started in pre-season."
Gibbes and Peel join the Ulster coaching team after the departures of Neil Doak and Allen Clarke while Kiss has retained Niall Malone in his video analysis and skills development capacity.
