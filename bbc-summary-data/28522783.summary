QEGS teacher John Mead jailed for child sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former grammar school teacher has been jailed for three years for historical child sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Mead, 76, of Timbrills Avenue, Sabden, was convicted by a jury of four counts of indecent assault involving three boys under the age of 14.
Preston Crown Court heard he committed the offences in the 1970s when he taught at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School (QEGS), Blackburn, Lancashire.
QEGS said it was glad to bring an end to the "dreadful matter".
The school said: "Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School is glad to hear that the sentence of former physics teacher John Mead to a prison term of three years brings to an end this dreadful matter.
"We hope that Mead's victims will feel that justice has been fully served and they may now have the closure they deserve after so long a wait."
The school said it had fully co-operated with the police but said Mead's crimes were committed more than 40 years ago and had nothing to do with the modern school, which "observes the highest standards of child safeguarding".
Det Sgt Julie Cross, from Lancashire Police, said she was pleased Mead had been given a custodial sentence and hoped it would bring "some closure to his victims so that they start to move on with their lives".
She added: "We are committed to investigating all allegations of this nature thoroughly and sensitively."
Mead has also been placed on the sex offenders register.
