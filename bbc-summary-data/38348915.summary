Four men from Derby, a man from Burton upon Trent and a woman from London were arrested on suspicion of offences under the Terrorism Act on Monday.
The North East Counter Terrorism Unit was later granted more time to question the six people.
A further extension means the suspects can now be held until Boxing Day.
The four men from Derby are aged 22, 27, 35 and 36. The suspect from Burton upon Trent is aged 27 and the woman from London is 32.
Six properties were searched as part of Monday's operation, which was regarded as "significant" and the result of an ongoing investigation, the BBC understands.
Sources said the investigation was into a group believed to be working towards an attack, although a strike was not thought to be imminent.
