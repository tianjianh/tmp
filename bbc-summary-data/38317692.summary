GLAdys - named after the airport's international code - will entertain passengers in the departure area with songs, dancing and stories.
She is said to be the first robot to be used by a UK airport.
GLAdys is part of a trial that could eventually see more robots used to interact and help direct passengers around the airport.
The 4ft humanoid has been dressed in a Santa outfit and programmed to sing and dance to Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Rocking around the Christmas Tree and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, as the airport prepares for Christmas.
It is the latest development in the airport's digital passenger experience project, designed to explore how customer engagement can be enhanced through digital technology.
