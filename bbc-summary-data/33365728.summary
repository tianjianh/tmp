Welsh MPs' fears over new English veto

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh MPs have asked for reassurances that Wales will not be disadvantaged by plans to give English MPs a veto over laws deemed only to affect England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The so-called "English votes for English laws" measures have been announced in response to devolution.
Commons Leader Chris Grayling said the change would bring "real fairness to our constitutional arrangements".
But former Tory Welsh Secretary David Jones said decisions on some services in England would affect Wales.
Under the proposals announced in Parliament on Thursday, all MPs would continue to vote on all key stages of legislation.
But English MPs - and in some cases English and Welsh MPs - will have a veto in Westminster when debating matters that have been devolved to administrations across the UK.
Mr Jones, MP for Clwyd West, raised the matter of cross-border issues, saying people in north Wales were "heavily reliant upon services provided in England, most particularly health services".
"They are already disadvantaged by the defective devolution settlement put in place by the party opposite, " he told Mr Grayling.
"Can he assure the House that they are not further disadvantaged by the measures he is putting in place?"
The minister responded by saying Welsh MPs would still be able to vote on, and to contribute to, decision making about health issues in England but added that "those matters cannot simply be imposed on the English against their wishes".
Newport West Labour MP Paul Flynn called for a constitutional convention to discuss setting up a federal UK, accusing the UK government of "staggering and stumbling with these ad hoc steps ... that will lead to the certain break up of the United Kingdom".
In response to a question from Plaid Cymru MP Hywel Williams, Mr Grayling admitted that there would only be a "relatively small" number of England-only committees needed to consider such bills, and that most Commons committees would continue to be made up of MPs from across the UK.
