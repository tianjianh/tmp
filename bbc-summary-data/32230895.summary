Get your foam fingers ready - Rochelle Humes says her new game show, Ninja Warriors, is tougher than Gladiators.

Speaking to the Radio 1 Breakfast Show with Nick Grimshaw, she says: "It's basically the toughest obstacle course on TV ever."
The series, based on Japanese show Sasuke, is a hit in the US, Malaysia and Sweden and will also be hosted by Ben Shephard and Chris Kamara.
"It's so fun, it's so much fun," The Saturdays singer continues.
"We've just shot all of it in Manchester and I've had such a ball.
"It's a real family show. It's a Gladiators meets Total Wipeout sort of thing. It's full-on, it's hard and it really tests people," she explains.
250 competitors will start, but it's thought few of them will complete the course.
At the end they'll have to run up a huge tower named Mount Midoriyama to be crowned the first Ninja Warrior UK.
"What's great about the show is that all sorts of people can enter, so we've had people from midwives to firemen to teachers," she says.
"Actually we had a gladiator come on - I don't think I can say who - but it's not as easy as he thought."
And Rochelle admits that they even made Ben Shephard have a go.
"The guy's so fit it's unbelievable and he did really, really well."
She says she won't be doing it herself though.
"Even running around the course to interview people was exhausting, so they'll have trouble getting me to have a go.
"Guess what we have too? The foam finger. I've got one at home."
Ninja Warriors starts this Saturday at 19:00 BST on ITV1
