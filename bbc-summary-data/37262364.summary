Rio Olympics 2016: UK Sport chief 'disturbed' by IOC's decision on Russia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
UK Sport chief Liz Nicholl says she was "disturbed" by the International Olympic Committee's decision not to ban Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Individual sport federations were left to decide whether to bar Russia following a report in July which alleged state-sponsored doping.
The country is banned from September's Paralympics in Rio.
"I was disappointed the IOC delegated responsibility to the federations," she told Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money.
"I personally think that if there has been such evidence through [Richard] McLaren's report of a significant state-level doping regime in a country then the state should suffer the consequences."
That report, commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, alleged that Russia operated a doping programme for four years across the "vast majority" of summer and winter Olympic sports.
It stated that it was "planned and operated" from late 2011 - including the build-up to London 2012 - and continued through the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics until August 2015.
Wake Up To Money: Sports Edition will be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 live on Saturday, 3 September at both 05:00 and 11:00 BST.
