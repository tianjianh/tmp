Jackson Page trailed Jason Weston 3-1, but won three frames on the trot to eliminate the world number 123.
He attends school in Ebbw Vale and told BBC Radio Wales: "School let me have whatever time off I want because they know there could be a career in it."
"When that black went in, I didn't know what to feel. It was just unreal."
The teenager, who hopes to turn professional "as soon as possible", added: "I was a wildcard [entry] so everyone was telling me just to enjoy it, for experience. But I knew I could still do well and hopefully win a few games and that's what I did first game.
"I'm really happy with that."
Page attends Ebbw Fawr Learning Community in Blaenau Gwent and while his focus is on competing in Cardiff, he will head to Cyprus in March where the European Under-18, Under-21 and men's championships take place.
He has won £2,500 for reaching the second round and would earn another £1,000 if he progresses to the third round.
Another win to reach the last 16 would earn Page £6,000.
Meanwhile, world number three John Higgins, winner of the Welsh Open four times, suffered a shock 4-2 defeat by Sam Baird.
Just 24 hours after his defeat by Barry Hawkins in the World Grand Prix final, Ryan Day beat David Gilbert 4-3, while world number 95 and six-time World Championship finalist Jimmy White was beaten 4-1 by 2016 finalist Neil Robertson.
Stuart Bingham, the 2015 world champion, beat Welshman Matthew Stevens 4-2, Wales' Dominic Dale overcame Zhang Anda 4-0 and Shaun Murphy defeated Jamie Curtis-Barrett 4-0.
