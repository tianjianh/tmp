Athletics doping scandal: Kenya 'failing on drug issues'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kenya's government has failed to seriously tackle doping in athletics, according to the chairman of the country's Olympic committee.

There are 15 Kenyans currently banned for doping by the IAAF, including Boston Marathon winner Rita Jeptoo
Kipchoge Keino says authorities are ignoring the subject despite pressure from the World Anti-Doping Agency.
"I have tried to reach government officials to agree on how to act but I don't get appointments," he said.
"I make calls that are unanswered. We even tried to convince senior government officials to attend these meetings, but they instead delegate to junior officers."
Keino, a two-time Olympic champion himself, was speaking after a Wada commission report accused Russia of widespread doping.
The report called for Russia to be banned from competitive athletics for running a "state-supported" doping programme.
But UK Athletics chairman Ed Warner has said other nations need to focus on cleaning up the sport.
"In athletics there are a handful of countries who do not have robust anti-doping regimes, who are asleep on the job - whether by accident or criminality - and they have to be rooted out," he said.
In a statement released on Saturday, Athletics Kenya outlined initiatives by the government to prevent doping and reiterated their commitment to the fight against cheating in sport.
Keino went on to suggest the government should introduce new laws to criminalise those involved in doping.
"That way, we shall convince the world of our commitment to fighting this crime. Anything else is just sugar coating," he added.
