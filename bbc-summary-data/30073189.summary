Shukria Barakzai, a women's rights advocate and ally of new President Ashraf Ghani, was lightly injured in the attack.
"[Ms Barakzai] is fine and suffers small injuries," Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted.
"Unfortunately three civilians martyred and around 17 injured," he added.
Ms Barakzai was travelling in a convoy containing other lawmakers on their way to parliament when a car tried to ram the politician's vehicle and the attacker detonated explosives, reports said.
Afghanistan is grappling with a vicious insurgency, led by the Taliban.
The latest incident comes a week after a suicide bomber entered the offices of Kabul's police chief in one of the most fortified areas of the capital and killed a senior officer.
