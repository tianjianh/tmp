They had been due to walk out on Wednesday in a row over pay with Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.
The union said the suspended strike would allow "further discussion of the health board's latest offer."
A spokeswoman said the health board was "fully committed to resolving the concerns of our staff".
About 80 staff, who are members of the Unison union, already staged a 24-hour strike on 25 January.
The latest strike had been due to affect Morriston, Neath Port Talbot and Princess of Wales hospitals.
The workers want "pay parity with colleagues doing the same job in other hospitals in Wales".
Mark Turner, Unison regional organiser said: "If there is no satisfactory outcomeâ€Ž to those talks, they are ready to resume and escalate the strikes on 22 and 23 of February."
