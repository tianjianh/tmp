[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aidan Sands' family sue caravan park owners for £50,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of a six-year-old boy who died after being pulled unconscious from a caravan park swimming pool are suing the campsite's owners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aidan Sands was found at the bottom of the pool at the Red Lion Caravan Park in Arbroath on 18 June 2011.
He passed away in Ninewells Hospital in his native Dundee four days later.
After his mother also died last February, her parents have taken on a legal case against the campsite's owners for £50,000.
Three years on from the incident, the Crown Office is still considering whether charges under health and safety legislation will be brought against Loch Earn Caravan Parks Ltd.
The family of the Mill O'Mains primary school pupil want to find out why he died and ask questions about staffing at the pool at the time of the incident.
Brian Castle, a partner at law firm Digby Brown's Dundee office, confirmed he was representing the family in a case at the Court of Session.
He said: "The circumstances of this case are deeply tragic, and we have raised civil proceedings because we are determined and committed to helping the family get answers to the many questions they still have about what happened."
Loch Earn Caravan Parks Ltd declined to comment on the case.
