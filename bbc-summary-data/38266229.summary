Slaughtneil assistant manager John Joe Kearney says the team are expecting a "difficult task" in Sunday's All-Ireland Club Football quarter-final against London champions St Kiernan's.

Facilities at the Greenford venue are said to be "basic" and Kearney says the game is a potential "banana skin".
"We hope to come home with a win but there are no guarantees," Kearney told BBC Sport Northern Ireland.
St Kiernan's earned their first London title by beating Tir Chonaill Gaels.
They earned a dominant 0-12 to 0-5 win in the London decider in October with midfielders James Moran and Cathal Greene among those to impress.
Other influential Kiernan's players include wing-backs Patrick Begley and Mark Mulholland.
St Kiernan's victory in the London decider prevented Tir Chonaill Gaels from clinching a third successive title.
Mayo man Moran and Laois native Greene have proved a formidable centrefield partnership this year while captain Adrian Moyles and Michael O'Donoghue both hit three points in the London final with Michael Callery chipping in with 0-2.
However, Moran and Callery are reported to be among a number of injury doubts for the London champions.
With London's county ground Ruislip being redeveloped, Sunday's match is being played at Tir Chonaill Gaels' home venue in Greenford.
After winning their second Ulster Club Football title in three years last week by edging out Kilcoo 0-12 to 0-9, Slaughtneil will go into Sunday's game as strong favourites but it will not be a major surprise if St Kiernan's prove competitive opponents, as least during the opening stages of the game.
While one can assume that Slaughtneil have been attempting to assemble as much information as they can on the Exiles, assistant boss Kearney insists that they know "absolutely nothing" about the opposition.
"We are going into uncharted territory. When we are at home, we know what the opposition is but London is a new experience for us.
"We don't know a lot about the pitch other than it is going to be fairly primitive compared what we are used to."
The Ulster champions' squad will fly to the British capital on Saturday evening as part of an expected exodus from Slaughtneil.
"From what I hear, most of Slaughtneil is following us to London. I think money is going to be tight enough this Christmas in Slaughtneil," concluded Kearney.
