Angry Marseille fans criticised owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and described her as an "incompetent rich heiress" as their troubled season continued.

The former European champions and nine-times French league winners have not won a home league game since September.
Another banner held up during Marseille's 0-0 draw with Bordeaux said: "Go back to your real job, housewife."
Margarita Louis-Dreyfus is the widow of former owner Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
Club president Vincent Labrune was also targeted by supporters in the notorious Yankee Nord terrace at Marseille's Stade Velodrome on Sunday as more dropped points left Marseille just six points above the relegation zone.
Fans also played the theme tune from British slapstick comedy, the Benny Hill Show, to show their anger at the way the club is being run.
Around 200 supporters were dispersed by police using tear gas at the end of the game.
