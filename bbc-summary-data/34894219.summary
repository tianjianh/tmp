[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are treating two arson attacks on vehicles in Ballymena, County Antrim, as hate crimes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A car was set alight in Dunclug Gardens at about 3:30 GMT on Sunday.
The other car was set on fire in Dunclug Park shortly before 05:00 GMT.
It is understood the vehicles belong to two men from eastern Europe.
Police have appealed for information.
Sinn FÃ©in MLA DaithÃ­ McKay said the attacks were "totally wrong and must be condemned outright".
The North Antrim representative added: "It is those behind these attacks who are not welcome in our society - not those who they targeted."
