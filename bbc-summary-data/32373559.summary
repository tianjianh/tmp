The Lower Pump House at Stourhead has been "brought back to its former glory" after falling into disrepair.
It needed £60,000 of work, made possible following a £260,000 grant from the Sita Trust.
Work included repairs to walls and replacing the roof, as well as restoring the waterwheel itself.
The trust is continuing to fundraise to repair other features in the garden, near Mere, and work has recently started on King Alfred's Tower.
Alan Power, Stourhead's head gardener, said: "It will be good to see the wheel turning and one of the more functional parts of the estate back in good condition once more.
"It doesn't pump water anymore but it still represents part of the history of how the garden was operated 100 years ago."
The pump house was built in 1897 and was an important part of the water supply to the village of Stourton, and Stourhead House itself.
Water from the lake powered a waterwheel, which then pumped fresh spring water for the local houses.
The whole system continued to work until the 1960s when mains water arrived to replace it.
The wider £640,000 project aims to conserve the buildings, features and structures around the grounds at the Stourhead estate.
