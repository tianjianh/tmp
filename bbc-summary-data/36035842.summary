Liverpool's volunteers who fought in the Easter Uprising

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The stories of volunteers from Liverpool who fought in the Easter Uprising in Dublin in 1916 are being told at an exhibition in the city.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Liverpool Irish Volunteers were 50 young men and women who took up arms as part of the rebellion to overthrow British rule in Ireland.
The Republican flag that was raised over the General Post Office was done so by Joe Gleeson, a Liverpool man.
Photographs, medals and letters show why the volunteers took action.
Teachers and journalists, clerks and dockers were united by their commitment to Irish independence.
The exhibition - compiled by Liverpool Easter 1916 Commemoration Committee - also features the King brothers. George, Patrick and John King crossed the Irish Sea to fight in the rebellion.
Dr Kevin McNamara said the archive material unearthed from descendants, families and the libraries of Liverpool shone a spotlight on a "forgotten chapter" in the city's history.
He said the exhibition provides "a focal point enabling people to explore the motivations of the men and women who travelled to Ireland and the reactions of those in Liverpool when they returned".
"It is a significant chapter both in Ireland's history but also in the shared heritage this city has with Ireland".
The display at the Museum of Liverpool is part of events in the city to mark the centenary of the battle for independence in Ireland.
Some of the Liverpool Irish Volunteers went on to take part in the Irish War of Independence (1919-21) and the Irish Civil War (1922-23).
Others  returned home and continued to meet at the Irish Centre in Liverpool's Mount Pleasant until the 1980s.
The Easter Rising was quelled within six days by British troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the Republic of Ireland and the partition of Ireland.
More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting.
