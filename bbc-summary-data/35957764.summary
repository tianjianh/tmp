Myron Isaac-Yarde was found dying in Camplin Street, New Cross, after officers were called to reports of an altercation between a number of youths.
Officers said a post-mortem cited the cause of death as a result of a stab injury.
A friend of the musician said he was "truly loved" and would be missed.
Two boys aged 15 and 16 are being held in custody, and a murder investigation has been launched.
Both were arrested close to the scene.
Myron's friend Kyle said: "He had a soft spot for everyone - that's why he was so truly loved.
"He's going to be missed by friends and family and I just want people to remember Myron in a positive way."
Jay Thomas, who has raised more than Â£2,000 to help Myron's family with funeral costs, said: "I want to give Myron the send-off he deserves.
"He had a lot of friends and everybody knew who he was. His main focus was music and his goals were always to make it in music.
"He was so young. It's such a shock "
Other friends took to social media to pay tribute to Myron, who performed under the name Mdot.
One wrote: "Absolute terrible tragedy. MDot, watched your big smiling face singing online and now just want to turn the clock back."
Another said: "I'm devastated. An exceptional young man. Our classroom will never be the same without you. Rest in peace Myron."
Derek Sarpong wrote: "I just find it hard to believe this. I wish this was a dream."
Mobo award-winning hip hop artist Tony Rotton, who grew up in Deptford and performs as Blak Twang, said: "I remember navigating my way out of the same exact roads in Deptford and New Cross at 17. Let's break the cycle of violence. RIP."
A local resident told BBC Radio London she called an ambulance after seeing the teenager limping before he collapsed on the ground, at about 19:40 BST.
She said she administered first aid while she waited for paramedics to arrive.
Det Ch Insp Rebecca Reeves of the Metropolitan Police said: "It was still daylight when the altercation began and we believe there could have been many people in the area who may have seen something which could provide valuable information to the investigation.
"I would urge them to contact police as soon as possible."
She said she was also interested in finding out about another altercation at 19:30 to 19:40 GMT on New Cross Road, at the junction with Avonley Road.
DCI Reeves added: "Witnesses have described an altercation involving a group of male youths and it is important that anyone who witnessed this comes forward and speaks to the police, so that we can establish if it is linked to the murder."
