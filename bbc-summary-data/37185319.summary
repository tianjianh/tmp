Northampton Town manager Rob Page says "half the Rhondda Valley" wants tickets for his side's EFL Cup third round match against Manchester United.

Welshman Page's side beat West Brom on penalties to set up the Sixfields tie.
"I've had a couple of pals texting me talking about when we used to collect the Panini stickers," said Page.
"There was a couple of Tottenham and Liverpool fans, and I was Man United. It's great to have those memories, I've always looked out for their results."
He added to BBC Radio Northampton: "It's a great opportunity for the players and they deserve that for the performance the other night."
The League One side have never beaten Manchester United in four matches, their most recent meeting being an FA Cup game in 2004.
But former Wales defender Page says his side must not lose focus on their league campaign, starting against Coventry on Saturday.
"They'll be able to get themselves up for the Manchester United game - if they don't they're in the wrong profession," said Page.
"What's important now is that we're grounded and realise it's the league campaign that's our priority and there's a lot of points to be gained from now until we play Manchester United."
