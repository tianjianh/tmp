Andrew Chan married Febyanti Herewila on Monday in a ceremony attended by family and friends.
Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, also Australian, were convicted in 2006.
The two, along with six other foreigners and an Indonesian, could be executed by firing squad as early as Tuesday.
They were formally notified on Saturday that they would be executed. Under Indonesian law, convicts must be given 72 hours' notice of execution.
A French drug trafficker is appealing against his conviction.
Who are the 10 facing execution?
Andrew Chan's brother, Michael, told reporters about his brother's marriage after visiting him on the Nusakambangan prison island.
"It was an enjoyable moment," he said. "It's tough times, but happy times at the same time."
"Hopefully the [Indonesian President Joko Widodo] will still show some compassion, some mercy - so these two young people can carry on with their lives," he added.
Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop earlier made last-minute pleas to delay the execution of its two nationals until a corruption investigation into their case was complete.
But Indonesia's attorney general later confirmed that the nine death row convicts would be executed as planned, without giving an indication of when the executions would be likely to take place.
Attorney General HM Prasetyo told the BBC a judicial review "could not amend [a] previous court ruling" and that "foreigners do not have any legal standing for a judicial review on the Constitutional Court".
Claims that the Indonesian judges in the trial had asked for bribes for lighter sentences first surfaced earlier this year.
One of the judges involved in the case denied there had been political interference or negotiations about bribes.
"I can assure you there was none," the judge told Fairfax Media. "We protected ourselves from everybody. It was purely our decision."
Chan and Sukumaran, along with seven other Australians, were arrested in Bali in 2005 for trying to smuggle more than 18lb (8.3kg) of heroin from Indonesia to Australia.
The pair were later found to be the ringleaders of the group and sentenced to death. The other seven members of the "Bali Nine" are currently serving either life or 20 years in prison.
Indonesia has some of the toughest drug laws in the world and ended a four-year moratorium on executions in 2013.
