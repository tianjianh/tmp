The Wales star, 27, hobbled out of Tuesday's 2-1 Champions League win at Sporting Lisbon with an ankle injury.
"He suffered more of a twist than a knock, but we will have to wait and see what the problem is," said Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane.
La Liga leaders Real, who have a four-point advantage over Barca, go to the Nou Camp on Saturday, 3 December.
Zidane added: "On Wednesday, he will be examined by our medical staff and after that, we will find out more."
The Champions League holders booked their place in the last 16 by beating Portuguese side Sporting with a late goal.
France defender Raphael Varane put them ahead, but Adrien Silva's 81st-minute penalty appeared to be enough to earn a draw for the home side.
Substitute Karim Benzema nodded in centre-back Sergio Ramos's cross as Madrid extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 30 games.
Zidane's team will finish top of Group F if they win their final match against current leaders Borussia Dortmund, who thrashed Legia Warsaw in a record 8-4 win.
