A village pub, visited of Chinese President Xi Jinping and then Prime Minister David Cameron, could be the model for a chain of pubs across China.

Chinese investment firm SinoFortone has bought The Plough at Cadsden, near Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire.
Mr Cameron took Mr Xi there during the state visit to the UK in October 2015.
Peter Zhang, managing director of SinoFortone, said the English pub concept with fish and chips and beer was growing "very fast" in China..
"We see bigger opportunities, namely countries lying between China and Europe, where we believe we could also export the UK brand internationally," he said.
The Plough, which dates back to the 16th Century, shot to fame in China when the president ate fish and chips and drank a pint during a state visit to the UK last year.
Buses now ferry hundreds of Chinese tourists from London to the country pub.
While the inn was not officially up for sale, SinoFortone Investment managed to strike a deal after approaching pub and restaurant agent Christie and Co, to ask the owners if they would sell.
SinoFortone, which has been linked with a bid for Liverpool Football club,  is also involved in the new London Paramount theme park development and the proposed Crossrail 2 route through London.
Pub group Greene King has also seen sales of its beers rocket in China after Mr Xi's visit.
