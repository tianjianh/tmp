The former hooker will replace Chris Gibbes, who confirmed in January he will become head coach of the Wellington Lions in New Zealand.
Capped eight times by Ireland, Clarke was a part of the Ulster team which won the 1999 Heineken Cup.
"I'm delighted to have this opportunity and really excited about the next challenge in my career," said Clarke.
As a coach, the 49-year-old helped the province win the 2006 Celtic League title before joining the Irish Rugby Union as high performance manager.
He returned to Ulster in 2012 and became forwards coach two years later.
Clarke also has international coaching experience with Ireland A and Emerging Ireland, with whom he won the 2015 Tbilisi Cup ahead of Georgia, Italy A and Uruguay.
"I'm looking forward to the challenge," added Clarke.
"It's an ambitious organisation with a great mix of experience and some real talent coming through and I hope I can add value for the players, the coaches and the management.
"Chris Gibbes has done a great job in building a pack that has the potential to go toe-to-toe with anyone and I'm grateful to have that platform to work from when I arrive in the summer."
