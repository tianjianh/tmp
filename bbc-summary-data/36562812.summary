Man jailed for 'vicious' bottle attack in Renfrewshire

A man who carried out a "vicious" bottle attack on someone who tried to break up a fight in Renfrewshire has been jailed for five-and-a-half years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daryn Dolan, 26, hit Kieran Barstow, 24, with a bottle which smashed, before using it to repeatedly injure him.
The attack in Ferguson Street, Johnstone, happened on 19 June last year following a row over a noisy car.
Dolan pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting Mr Barstow to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Glennie told Dolan that he had no other option but to send him to prison for the "vicious" assault.
The court had previously heard that Dolan, of Linwood, Renfrewshire, was the passenger in a car whose engine was being revved.
Mr Barstow's friend, James McCarthur, asked the driver to keep the noise down.
Mr Barstow was then attacked when he tried to stop a fight which subsequently broke out between a woman that was in the car and a girl he was with.
Dolan ran off after the attack and was not placed by police until 20 August.
The victim suffered cuts on his face, scalp, arms, right foot and bruising to his right hand. He also required surgery to repair a 15cm cut to his jawline.
