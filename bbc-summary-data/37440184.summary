Newport County boss Warren Feeney is drawing inspiration from Brian Clough, Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola as he tries to transform the Exiles' League Two fortunes.

County are one place above the relegation zone ahead of Saturday's home game with bottom club Cambridge.
Feeney tried to watch Guardiola's Manchester City train while they're in Wales this week facing Swansea twice.
But the Exiles' boss revealed: "It was a big 'no' from them."
The former Northern Ireland international added: "There was a possibility, but I think it's Pep's ruthlessness that he likes to keep it all in house which you can understand as they're a world class team."
Newport have won just one of their opening seven league games and have one of the worst defensive records in the division.
Feeney though is not concerned with his team's plight.
"No one is cutting us open, we're giving team's goals and that has got to stop," he said.
"I've no problems because I think we've been playing some very good football.
"We watched the Brian Clough DVD last week on the bus and you see Jose Mourinho at Manchester United had them training in a car park before the Northampton game.
"I am a believer in different methods as there's no right, there's no wrong."
But it is for Manchester City boss Guardiola, whose side are training at Newport's Celtic Manor between two game with the Swans, that Feeney reserved his deepest admiration.
"Guardiola? Yes, he's got unbelievable players, but I can tell you now, I know a few people who work for him and he's absolutely ruthless," said Feeney.
"He's got a great philosophy and knows what he wants, but he's still got that old school mentality.
"I read all the books on them, you've got to learn from them."
Feeney is confident his team will not face the same relegation battle as last season and is urging fans not to panic.
"Football doesn't phase me at all, I just think there's a lot of frustration going around here because Doncaster was our third loss.
"There's teams up around the top of the table who've got three losses, but they've won more games."
Meanwhile defenders Jamie Turley and Darren Jones, along with striker Jon Parkin, are all doubts to face Cambridge, while midfielder Joss Labadie is definitely out with a hamstring injury.
