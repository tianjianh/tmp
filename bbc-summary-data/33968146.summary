[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A post-mortem examination has revealed Katelyn Parker, 24, had been strangled with a ligature, police said.
She was found in a blue Nissan car on River Street, Heywood on Friday.
Police were tipped off that a body was in the boot of a Nissan car and officers followed one seen in Claybank Street.
They discovered it had been abandoned nearby.
Ms Parker's family said: "She saw the best in everybody and was happiest when spending time with her friends and family.
"Katelyn was a vibrant and sociable young woman with a big heart and an even bigger smile. She will leave a void in all our lives and her death under such tragic circumstances is something that we will never be able to come to terms with."
Lee Nolan, of Bamford Road, Heywood, has been charged with murder and is due at Manchester Crown Court on Tuesday.
Anybody with information is asked to contact police or Crimestoppers.
