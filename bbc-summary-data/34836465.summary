[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Paralympic fencer Gabi Down has retired from the sport at the age of 17 because of a wrist injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Down was one of Great Britain's youngest para-athletes competing at London 2012 and she helped the women's epee team finish eighth.
She has just had a year-long break and does not want to risk surgery which would "leave me with scar tissue and potentially a worse injury".
"I still want to stay as involved with fencing as I possibly can," she added.
