Storm disrupts trains between London and Stansted Aiport

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High winds have brought major disruptions to train services between London stations and Stansted Airport, Bedford and Cambridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were about 20 cancellations on the Liverpool Street to Stansted rail line after a tree fell on to overhead power lines near Bishop's Stortford.
Storm winds brought a tree down on to overhead wires which caught fire between Harpenden and St Albans.
This has led to disruption between Bedford and London St Pancras.
Thameslink, which runs this service, said disruption was likely to continue until midday.
Abellio Greater Anglia said its services to Stansted Airport and Cambridge had been hit by the storm.
The company added that a train fault had also led to a number of trains on the Liverpool Street to Norwich route in the morning being cancelled.
Abellio Greater Anglia currently runs the Greater Anglia franchise and runs services to Stansted Airport, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk, Hertfordshire and Suffolk.
