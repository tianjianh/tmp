A 107-year-old yacht is nearing a return to Sunderland for restoration after campaigners raised more than £20,000 in three weeks.

The Senora Trust wants to bring the Senora, which was built on the Wear in 1908, back from a scrapyard.
They said the boat was weeks away from being used as firewood.
The restoration will be carried out by 24 trainees and is hoped to be completed for Sunderland's hosting of the 2018 Tall Ships Festival.
North East builders' merchant James Burrell donated £10,000 to the restoration campaign, with the rest coming from public donations.
The Senora Trust is now working to raise £250,000 to launch the next phase of the project.
Kim Simpson from the trust said: "Now that we have purchased her for Sunderland, she will become The People's Yacht, creating training and jobs.
"When she is restored to her former glory, she'll give hundreds of people every year the chance to enjoy sailing for themselves."
