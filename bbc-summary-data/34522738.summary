The value of the deal was not disclosed, but could be worth tens of millions of dollars, experts said.
Pitchfork is known for its independent voice in the music scene and promoting alternative artists.
Condé Nast, publisher of Vogue and Wired, wants to capitalise on the music site's young, growing audience.
Announcing the deal, Condé Nast's chief digital officer Fred Santarpia said: "The acquisition of Pitchfork reflects Condé Nast's continued belief in the power of authentic editorial voices to engage influential audiences at scale."
Pitchfork could offer Condé Nast growth in both online video and events, areas that are becoming increasingly important to publishers.
It will be the publisher's first standalone music outlet.
Worthofweb.com estimated that the Pitchfork website alone was worth $82m.
Pitchfork fans took to twitter to express concerns that the deal would overcommercialise the brand.
