John Longworth told the BCC's annual conference on Thursday that the UK's long-term prospects could be "brighter" outside the EU.
The BCC's official line is that it will not campaign for either side before the 23 June referendum vote as its membership is split.
The BCC said it had no comment.
The Financial Times reported the group held an emergency meeting to discuss how to reconcile the difference in views between Mr Longworth and many BCC members on EU membership.
Members were later told Mr Longworth had been temporarily suspended for breaching the group's official position of neutrality, the paper added.
Mr Longworth had described the referendum as a choice between the "devil and the deep blue sea".
One option was staying in an "essentially unreformed EU", with the other being the uncertainty of leaving, he told the conference.
Mr Longworth added: "The dynamism and resilience of the City of London and the UK business sector suggests to me that, in the long run, we have the capacity and capability to create a bright, if not brighter, economic future outside of the EU - just as we would have done had we had the opportunity to stay in a truly reformed Europe."
BCC members will be surveyed so their views could inform the debate ahead of the vote in June, Mr Longworth added.
The BCC responded at the time by saying it would not be campaigning for either side and that Mr Longworth's comments "reflect his personal assessment, rather than the position of the BCC".
Pro-EU campaign group Britain Stronger in Europe said: "This affair demonstrates that, while some individual businesspeople are campaigning to leave the EU, their views do not come close to representing the clear majority of British businesses - large and small."
