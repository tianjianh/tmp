The 39-year-old led the club to consecutive promotions from the National League to League One before a 10th-place finish in 2016-17.
After assisting former boss John Ward, Clarke took charge in March 2014 prior to relegation to non-league that term.
His side finished seven points off the play-off places in May, in their first season back in the third tier.
He had signed a three-year deal to 2019 in May 2016, after turning down a formal approach from Championship side Leeds United.
"We were very keen for him to remain in charge and to build on the success he has brought to the club in a very short time," club president Wael Al Qadi told the club website.
"It was important, we felt, to ensure we had the man we wanted at the helm. With Darrell as manager, we feel that the club is in a stable position and we are confident that he will continue to move us forward."
Clarke added: "I would like to thank the club's owners and directors for giving me the opportunity to continue, long term, to take the club forward and I would also like to thank our amazing fans."
