Election 2015: When political logos are altered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
As Hilary Clinton announced her intention to run for president a second time, it wasn't her policies that provoked a reaction online, it was her logo...

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Logos, it seems, are as important as the politician and policies they represent, so sometimes in an attempt to change their image political parties rebrand, as the Tories did when they went from torch to tree.
And sometimes other parties try a cheeky rebrand for them, as in the case of Labour using the altered version of the Lib Dem dove in 2010.
But political rebranding is no longer the preserve of the politicos, pollsters and ad agencies. A new age, it seems is upon us, as we hurtle towards the first general election.
Politics is playing out as much on social media as on the pages of the broadsheets. And the fun has already started...
The Lib Dems' yellow dove logo appears to be an easy target. Last week saw it become the butt of Twitter jokes across the country, after an unfortunate incident where their campaign bus hit a pigeon.
Another Twitter user, slightly ahead of the pack, offered one suggestion for a new Lib Dem in comment on how he saw their chances in October last year.
The Lib Dems have also jumped on the logo bandwagon, briefly changing their website logo to reflect reality TV star Joey Essex's remark that he had thought Nick Clegg's party were called the Liberal Democats before meeting the Lib Dem leader.
The other parties, however, haven't entirely escaped involuntary social media rebrands - such as the Tories' tree being unceremoniously turned upside down and set on fire:
And the SNP's 2014 Scottish referendum 'Yes' campaign logo being reworked and the Conservatives also being offered a cheeky top hat alternative logo.
UKIP haven't emerged unscathed either.  Some offered a Venn diagram suggesting they fall between Labour and the Conservatives, whilst another reflected on Nigel Farage's recent comment that the NHS failed to diagnose his testicular cancer accurately, telling him he had an infection.
This week is all about manifestos, and perhaps in the hope of avoiding uninvited rebrands similar to that of their 2010 manifesto below, Labour have gone for an entirely text-based front cover.
