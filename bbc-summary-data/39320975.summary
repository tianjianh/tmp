Leroy Fer: Middlesbrough game 'vital' says Swansea City midfielder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Swansea City midfielder Leroy Fer believes the club's next match against Middlesbrough will be pivotal in their battle to avoid Premier League relegation.

The Swans are three points and one place above the bottom three after their 2-1 loss at Bournemouth.
Paul Clement's side now face back-to-back home matches with Boro and Spurs after the international break.
"Middlesbrough is the game we need to win, that one is massive," he said.
"We have a massive game now against Middlesbrough," he continued.
"Our injured players can come back in the international break now, Martin Olsson and Kyle Naughton.

"With a good group, we can focus on the next game.
"We had a good opportunity to get clear (in the last two games), but that opportunity is not gone, we play Middlesbrough next.
"The last two games have not been our best week, the things we were doing before, we have to start doing again."
Fer says Swansea are still in a far better position than expected after enjoying a renaissance since Paul Clement's appointment.
The Swans were bottom of the league with just 12 points at the turn of the year, but Fer thinks the battle to stay up is probably going to last for the remainder of the campaign.
"We came from far back, we had no so many points when the gaffer came in, but we know we can play football," Fer said.
"Nobody would not have taken this position we are in now before Christmas and the new signings have (also) strengthened our team.
"We knew before the gaffer came in it would go down to the wire, we have nine big games left."

A season-ending injury to Angel Rangel and a muscular problem for Kyle Naughton forced Netherlands midfielder Fer to operate as an emergency right-back at Bournemouth, a role he is in no rush to repeat.
"I think my first couple of games for Feyenoord I played right-back, but I am a midfielder, so I just try to do my best," he explained.
"Of course it is different, a different position, playing right-back.
"I just try to do my best for the team, where the gaffer plays me I play and try to give my all.
"If the gaffer needs me I will play there, but hopefully Kyle is back soon.
"I trained there for two days, I tried my best."
