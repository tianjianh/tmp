It gave Spaniard Ramos-Vinolas a match point that he took to win 3-6 6-3 6-3 2-6 6-3.
Troicki said afterwards: "He should be the one who is fined, he cost me. I'm not saying he cost me the match but he cost me an important point.
"I behaved well. I didn't do anything until that moment. He's doing such a match and I've never seen him in my whole career. That's just crazy.
"I spoke to the referee after the match and I think it shouldn't happen that such a chair umpire can be on the singles court with the men's on grass, where there is no Hawk-Eye.
"He's not able to do a proper job, so I told him that. I was just boiling at that stage. I just couldn't talk normally."
