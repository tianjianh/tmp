Police in Naples have detained Camorra clan boss Mariano Riccio, aged 23 and described as one of the 100 most wanted men in Italy.

He is facing a 16-year jail sentence for drug trafficking and is seen by investigators as a key figure in a war for control of the mafia drug trade.
Riccio was seized outside the city and police said he did not resist arrest.
Separately, 29 suspected Camorra members have been arrested in Rome in connection with fraud and extortion.
They have been linked to the Zaza clan in the western Fuorigrotta area of Naples.
The Camorra is a formidable mafia network based in the Naples area, which is believed to have extended its influence to Rome and as far north as Florence.
Mario Riccio, believed by police to head another clan called the Amato-Pagato, has been on the run since 2011. He was reportedly arrested at a house north of Naples, where he was staying with his wife and baby daughter.
He is wanted for his alleged role in a drug feud in the Scampia area of northern Naples.
Beyond its role in the drugs trade, the Camorra has been active in illegal waste dumping around the city and the government said last month it would consider sending in the army to tackle the problem.
