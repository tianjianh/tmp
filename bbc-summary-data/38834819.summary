Ethan, 22, has made 16 first-team appearances for the Blues while 21-year-old Dillon has turned out 18 times since making his debut in 2015.
"Dillon is a very good prop, with a good all-round game and has achieved a lot," head coach Danny Wilson said.
"Ethan's another player we have high hopes for. He has also been unfortunate with injuries but is back fit."
