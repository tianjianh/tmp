The fire at the Church of the Ascension in Lower Broughton began at about 23:00 GMT on Sunday.
Greater Manchester Police confirmed it was now treating the blaze as suspicious.
Firefighters confirmed the top part of the two gable ends of the building, founded in 1869, will be dismantled on Tuesday to make it safe.
Police believe the church was broken into before it was set alight and have released CCTV footage of a suspect fleeing the scene.
Nearby residents were urged to keep their windows and doors shut while the blaze, which has since been brought under control, was at its height.
Fire investigators believe the blaze caused gas pipes inside the church to melt, before a gas leak ignited, causing further damage.
Fire station manager Dave Baxter said: "We've got a gas leak that has ignited inside the church. National Grid are here trying to isolate the gas externally from the property, It's a big old solid structure.
"We're putting water up from the outside in and we've got a hydraulic platform so we can assess the scene inside."
Liam Cole, 17, saw the flames from his home nearby.
"Initially it wasn't that bad but all of a sudden it was engulfed in flames and the roof started falling through," he said.
"There was a lot of ash and smoke from the roof going on the people standing very close."
