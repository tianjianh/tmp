The 62-year-old actor requested refugee status in the country in October 2010 after claiming his life was in danger from "Hollywood star-whackers".
Quaid's wife, Evi, told news agency The Canadian Press that the application was denied because her husband did not have a passport.
The couple have applied for a judicial review in Canada's federal court.
In the application, obtained by CBC News, the Quaids said their lives were still being threatened.
"Organised crime and its victims are serious issues and can not be tossed off until the claim is heard," the statement said.
"The refugee claims should remain intact, as should Evi and Randy Quaid's heads remain attached to their necks.
"It is their firm belief that their lives are at stake and being racketeered on."
Mrs Quaid said Randy's passport was seized by Canadian officials and that the actor would be at the US consulate in Toronto on 6 February in an attempt to get it back.
As her father was born in Canada, she already has Canadian citizenship and the ability to sponsor her husband.
The couple currently face charges of vandalism and illegally occupying a house in Santa Barbara, California.
After pleading not guilty, they failed to attend a court hearing and then fled to Canada seeking asylum.
Although warrants were issued for their arrest, US officials refused to seek their extradition last year.
However, Santa Barbara authorities have said they will arrest the Quaids if they return to the country.
Quaid, the older brother of fellow actor Dennis, is best known for his roles in such films as Kingpin, National Lampoon's Vacation and The Last Detail.
