The Romanian world number seven, 24, took both her break point opportunities in the first set while Slovakia's Cibulkova missed all three of hers.
One break was enough in the second set as Halep sealed victory with her third ace after one hour and 20 minutes.
Cibulkova had won three of their four previous encounters but was unable to make an impression on the 24 year old, who has now won 12 WTA Tour titles.
Cibulkova, the world number 38, had spent over four hours longer on court than Halep in reaching the final.
