Former triathlon world champion Stanford, 27, finished fourth in the event at this summer's Olympics in Rio, just missing out on a medal.
She wanted to run in the 10,000m at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, but did not compete in Glasgow because of injury.
"We're not sure how doable that is right now," Leeds-based Stanford told BBC Sport.
"They haven't, as far as I know, released the qualifying time or the timetabling to see if it's possible to double up.
"It's a different challenge and something a bit fresher and maybe [I can] look at a few different types of racing."

Stanford was ruled out of Glasgow 2014 by a stress fracture in her left ankle and hopes to make her Commonwealth Games debut in two years' time in Gold Coast, Australia.
Swansea-born Stanford will be in action at this weekend's ITU World Triathlon Series grand final in Cozumel, Mexico with compatriot Helen Jenkins also on the start line.
She is keen to put her Olympic disappointment behind her, having been beaten to the bronze medal by British team-mate and housemate Vicky Holland.
"It was a tough couple of weeks and I had mixed emotions," Stanford added.
"Vicky was third and I was absolutely delighted she was able to bring a medal home, but at the same time managing your own disappointment.
"For both of us it's been a bit of a rollercoaster but the most important thing to us is that whatever happened at the Games we would still be friends.
"For me, it means there's unfinished business with the Games.
"I'm still only 27 so it's not unrealistic for me to aim for another four years.
"I'm settled into the mindset that I will still be around in four years' time trying to win a medal for GB there."
