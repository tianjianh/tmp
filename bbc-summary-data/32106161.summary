The Queen will hand out Maundy money to 89 men and 89 women, the first time the service has been held in Sheffield.
Maundy Thursday recognises the service of elderly people to their community and their church.
Dr Croft said it had been a "huge amount of work for several months - in secret".
"There's a real sense of anticipation now, and joy that this is happening in Sheffield this year," he said.
The British monarch's Maundy Thursday service has been held in England since the 12th Century, to mark Jesus washing his disciples' feet.
Dr Croft said it was about expressing practical love for others, especially of the poor.
The Queen's visit was made public in January and has involved preparation from Sheffield Cathedral, the police and city council.
Dr Croft said the 175 recipients of Maundy Money had been nominated locally.
"It's a profound Christian reflection of the command to love one another, at the heart of the city," he said.
"Sheffield Cathedral will become a Chapel Royal for the day, and platters from the Crown Jewels will be brought to carry the Maundy Money."
The service has been held in almost every cathedral in England and some in Scotland and Wales.
BBC Radio Sheffield's Rony Robinson will be reporting on the event on Thursday.
