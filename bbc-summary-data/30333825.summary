Passenger demand at the UK's busiest train stations grew last year, according to the rail regulator.

The station most used - Waterloo - saw 98.4 million entries and exits in 2013-14, up 2.6% on the previous year.
The only non-London stations in the UK's top 10 were Birmingham New Street and Leeds.
London Euston experienced the sharpest rise in passenger numbers, increasing by 9.4% in 2013-14.
At London Victoria, numbers rose 5.2% to 81.4 million, the figures from the Office of Rail Regulation showed.
Other busy stations outside the top 10 included Glasgow Central (27.2 million passengers), Edinburgh (20 million), Brighton (17 million), Gatwick Airport (16.2 million) and Glasgow Queen Street (15.8 million).
A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: "These figures are further proof that more passengers are using our rail network than ever before."
She said the government was "investing record amounts in the network" in order to "provide a world-class railway for growing numbers of passengers".
Earlier this month, a report by the Network Rail-South West Trains Alliance calculated that there were more than 55 trains arriving at London Waterloo every hour.
It described services from that station to the south and west of England as among the most congested of the network.
