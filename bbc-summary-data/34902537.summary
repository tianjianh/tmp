'Spooked' urban peregrine falcons get new nests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pair of "spooked" peregrine falcons living in the centre of Leicester are to get a new nest after a "disappointing" breeding season.

The birds laid two eggs this year which disappeared, leaving the birds out of sorts. Leicestershire Police are investigating the eggs' disappearance.
It is hoped new nest boxes on the city's tallest buildings will provide a place for the pair to breed next year.
Tall buildings are said to "mimic the peregrines' natural environment".
Leicestershire and Rutland Ornithological Society (LROS), which has been monitoring the birds closely for the last two years, said the pair successfully reared two chicks in 2014.
Dave Gray, from LROS, said: "This year was disappointing.
"The birds laid two eggs in their nest, but the eggs disappeared and the birds were obviously spooked by something.
"We want to help the peregrines by encouraging them to nest at sites where we can watch them more easily and help prevent this happening again.
"The birds are active all year round so we hope they will have spotted the boxes and will start to use one of them next season."

Richard Kelly, assistant nature conservation officer for Leicester City Council, said: "Peregrines are attracted to towns and cities because there are the right places for them to nest and a good food supply to raise their young.
"The tall buildings resemble the craggy cliff faces they would normally breed on."
The birds of prey are thought to have been returning to the city, where there is a plentiful supply of pigeons, for decades.
