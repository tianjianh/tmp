Food and drink theme at Castle Douglas art exhibition

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An art exhibition to mark Scotland's Year of Food and Drink has opened in Dumfries and Galloway's food town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paintings, jewellery, woodwork, photography and ceramics are among the artworks by mainly local artists on display in Castle Douglas.
They include an abstract by local painter Annirose Ansbro, who took the theme of the exhibition literally.
She raided her kitchen cupboards for tea, coffee, liqueurs, fruit and mustard powder to use in Drool.
"I thought it would be fun to take the food and drink theme all the way, so I scoured the kitchen for ingredients I could use as well as conventional paint," she said.
"The smell of the painting was absolutely wonderful."
About 90 artists were invited to submit pieces to Spring Show: Art, Food and Drink, which acts as a taster for the Spring Fling open studios weekend in May.
The exhibition at the McGill Duncan Gallery runs until 23 April.
