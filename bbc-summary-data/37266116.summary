Former Royal Marine takes on island challenge adventure

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Royal Marine, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, is planning to cross the world's five largest islands in a year-long challenge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Louis Nethercott, of Wiltshire, served in Afghanistan before being medically discharged from 42 Commando this year.
With fellow former Marine Anthony Lambert he aims to cross Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Madagascar, Greenland and Baffin Island.
The 27-year-old said he wanted to "inspire" others with mental illness.
Mr Nethercott, who grew up in Bristol, saw comrades killed and injured during his time in Afghanistan.
He said his life changed dramatically after that tour and "it was a different world when I came back".
"I saw some pretty bad stuff, some hairy situations,." he said. "On coming home from that particular tour, things didn't quite add up for me.
"Something had changed, and changed dramatically."
Mr Nethercott is being supported by the charity Help for Heroes and said he wanted to complete the challenge to "inspire other guys who have battled similar problems to me".
"I want to show everybody that despite experiencing a setback, life is not over if you don't want it to be.
"It is about looking the dark days in the eye and saying you've come out the other end stronger."
The pair plan to begin their challenge in November by crossing Borneo.
Mr Nethercott said the route was about 1,400km "and will take us through some extremely remote and unexplored areas".
