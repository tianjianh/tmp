The former Burton boss was replaced by Gianfranco Zola at St Andrew's after more than two years with the Blues.
Rowett, 42, left Birmingham seventh in the Championship, only outside the play-off places on goal difference.
"I am extremely disappointed that my time as manager of Birmingham City has come to an end," said Rowett in a League Managers' Association statement.
"I felt we were only halfway through the project and I strongly believed we were on course to achieve our objectives."
Birmingham lost 2-1 at home to Brighton in their first match under Zola on Saturday.
"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the players, fans and everyone at the club for their support and hard work during my time at Birmingham City," added Rowett.
"I wish them well for the future and look forward to my next challenge in the game."
