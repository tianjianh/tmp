The victim, named by police as Ali Nasrollahi, 22, was found collapsed in Barnet on Tuesday afternoon.
Mr Nasrollahi, who was found at the junction of Woodside Grange Road and Grangeway, was treated by paramedics for a single stab wound but died soon after arriving at hospital.
Police have launched a murder inquiry and have appealed for witnesses to come forward. No arrests have been made.
Det Insp Julie Willats said: "We know that the victim had driven to Woodside Grange Road with one of his friends and met up with another friend, who had also driven there.
"At some stage, the victim interacted with a group of up to four suspects, during that interaction we believe he was stabbed.
"The group of suspects then ran off down Grangeway and into an alleyway that leads on to Woodside Avenue."
The victim's friend Mohamed Musalam said: "I'm shocked... I had to call 10 people to confirm because it was just unreal.
"He didn't deserve it at all, he wasn't that sort of a person where he hangs around with the wrong crowd or anything like that.
"He was a happy guy, the sort of guy that comes into a group and makes everyone laugh. I am heartbroken."
Officers are carrying out a forensic search in the area.
