The League Two champions had taken a penalty shoot-out bonus point after a draw with Premiership outfit Dundee in their opening game on Saturday.
First-half goals from Kevin Smith and Paul McManus secured the win for Gary Naysmith's side.
The Sons misery was compounded by a red card for defender Grant Gallagher.
Stevie Aitken's side are bottom of the table with one point along with Dundee, who have played one fewer game but are four points behind.
League One side Peterhead moved into second after opening their campaign with a 2-0 win at home to Forfar Athletic thanks to an Andy Munro own goal and a Rory McAllister penalty against the side relegated to the bottom tier.
Falkirk recovered from a shock opening loss to Stirling Albion with a 3-0 home win over Elgin City.
Goals from Will Vaulks, Lee Miller and Bob McHugh mean the Championship outfit are in a four-way tie at the top of Group B.
League Two outfit Stirling fell to a 2-1 defeat away to Brechin City, with Ally Love and Alan Trouten scoring either side of a Blair Henderson penalty.
Brechin, from League One, and Premiership outfit St Johnstone have three points from their one game.
Falkirk manager Peter Houston: "It was important after Saturday's result to bounce back.
"The result probably should have been more and that's a slight disappointment, but anything was better than Saturday because we didn't play well at all at Stirling Albion.
"We go to St Johnstone on Saturday. That'll be a tough test for us.
"I'm looking forward to it. We wanted to play in the Premiership and we fell a bit short there, so here's an opportunity to see if we're good enough. I think the squad has got stronger."
Raith Rovers had to rely on a Lewis Vaughan penalty three minutes from time to defeat League Two side Montrose at Stark's Park and lead Group D after a second straight victory.
Chris Johnston, the Championship side's summer signing from Kilmarnock, had opened the scoring before Michael Bolochoweckyj replied after the break.
Jack Ross's much-changed Alloa Athletic started their campaign with a 4-0 demolition of Highland League champions Cove Rangers at Recreation Park.
Greig Spence had them ahead before the break before Andy Graham, Jordan Kirkpatrick and Isaac Layne ensured an easy win for the League One side, who are now level with Premiership side Ross County after one game apiece.
Striker Derek Lyle's first-half double ensured that Queen of the South made it two wins out of two in Group E after with a 2-0 win over League Two outfit Airdrieonians.
The Championship outfit lead Partick Thistle, who have played one game less, and Queen's Park by three points.
The Spiders recovered from their opening home defeat by Queen of the South with a 2-0 win away to League One rivals Stenhousemuir.
Sean Burns and Conor McVey got the Glasgow side's goals.
Queen of the South manager Gavin Skelton: "The players deserve credit. It was a really hot night, but some of the players have got cramp because they worked so hard.
"We'll be better for it, the fitness levels, from playing in this heat.
"We're really looking forward to Saturday. Partick Thistle are a good side, they move the ball about well and they'll have ambitions in this competition."
Airdrieonians first-team coach Kevin McBride: "We set our standards the other night against Partick Thistle and fair to say we dropped way below it today.
"There's a way to lose a game and that's certainly not it.
"We're not at full strength yet, we still need two to three players in, but we're not panicking."
Greenock Morton went top of Group H with a narrow win over Clyde that did not reflect their dominance over the League Two visitors.
Thomas O'Ware scrambled the ball over the line following a 77th-minute corner to put the Championship side on five points, two ahead of Kilmarnock, the Premiership side who have played one game less.
League One side Albion Rovers moved on to three points after two games after winning a penalty shoot-out to take the bonus point after a 0-0 draw away to League Two outfit Berwick Rangers.
