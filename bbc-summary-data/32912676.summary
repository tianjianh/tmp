The crash happened at about 05:45 BST westbound at junction 31 for Girton. The road is closed between there and junction 36 for Nine Mile Hill.
Two of the lorry drivers were taken to hospital with minor injuries.
The road is expected to remain closed until about 13:00. Diversions are in place via the A11 and M11.
Cambridgeshire Police said none of the lorries shed their loads during the collision but confirmed one was carrying a cargo of seven-and-a-half tonnes of teddy bears.
Staff from a nearby shop have been seen handing out muffins to drivers stuck in the queues along part of the 16-mile closure.
At least 15 motorists were caught filming or taking pictures of the crash site with mobile phones and are due to be prosecuted, Cambridgeshire Police said.
Recovery of the vehicles is now taking place.
