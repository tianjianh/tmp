[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sex offender Calan Morrison guilty of rape and sex abuse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A convicted sex offender has been found guilty of rape, indecent assault and abduction charges.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Calan Morrison, 29, raped one woman at houses in Fernhill, Glasgow, and at Galston, East Ayrshire.
He indecently assaulted another victim at houses in Elderslie, Renfrewshire, and Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. He also abducted two women who were left locked in a flat in Faifley, Clydebank.
Sentence on Morrison was deferred and he was remanded in custody.
Morrison, who has a previous conviction for sex with an underage girl, was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
During his trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, Morrison accused the women of lying.
One woman told the court how she was raped by Morrison in 2014.
She told the jury: "I said 'no' about 100 times. I don't see how that could be consensual."
Another woman told the court how Morrison had grabbed her hair and forced her to perform a sex act.
One victim also said she was repeatedly locked in a flat by Morrison.
"I could never take the dog out for a walk. The dog used to defecate in the house," she said.
"There was electricity, but there was no heating. It was really cold," she said.
The woman told the court how she managed to get out of the flat in 2005 after sending a text to an acquaintance and the door was eventually broken down.
Another woman told Morrison's trial: "I was constantly locked in the house. He constantly wasn't there. I sat in the flat with no heating and no hot water."
The woman said that during the period in 2004 she was left feeling that her self-esteem had hit "rock bottom".
