[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super 8s: Wakefield Trinity 38-6 Leeds Rhinos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jacob Miller marked his return from a broken leg with a try as Wakefield ran in six tries in an outstanding display against Leeds Rhinos in the Super 8s.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joe Arundel scored for Wakefield early on but Adam Cuthbertson crossed to put the visitors level just minutes later.
Ben Jones-Bishop put Wakefield in front again while Scott Grix added the hosts' third almost straight from the restart.
Miller scored just before the break while Matty Ashurst and Bill Tupou wrapped up a win for the home side.
Wakefield move up two places to third in Super League by virtue of their victory, while Leeds remain second but still trail Castleford, who play Salford on Friday, by eight points.
Arundel, who missed Wakefield's two matches in the run up to facing Leeds, marked his return with a lovely try with just four minutes on the clock but left the field with a suspected dislocated elbow late on after a lengthy delay.
Wakefield were awarded their fifth try after Ashton Golding spilled the ball right on the try-line and Ashurst easily grounded it to score.
The hosts punished Leeds for another defensive mishap in their own half when Kallum Watkins spilled Grix's grubber kick and allowed Tupou to cross over.
Wakefield coach Chris Chester: "We've copped some criticism over the last seven days and rightly so because the performance last week wasn't to the standards we've set ourselves.
"But we answered a few questions tonight. We scored some nice, fancy tries but the defence was the best I've seen it in a long time.
"We've shown with this performance tonight we're not here to make the numbers up.
"We've got as good a chance as anybody competing for the top four.  We need to take a lot of confidence from that result. We fancy our chances against anybody."
Leeds head coach Brian McDermott: "Wakefield were really good. They were up for the fight and doing the tough stuff.
"We started off OK, but we started to look for answers with too many passes and offloads, although that's not why we lost.
"It's been a while since we've been beaten significantly like that. We'll have to have a reaction next week because St Helens are in form.
"I know the Challenge Cup was a disappointing loss but it's been a while since we've had that many points put on us and been that off with our preferred starting 13."
