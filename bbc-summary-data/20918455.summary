[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is believed Jason McGovern, of Tydavnet, was punched at a pub on John Street on Sunday.
He was hit a short time later at Cunningham Terrace car park and died in the early hours of New Year's Eve.
Two men aged 21, a 19-year-old man, an 18-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy are due in court in Omagh on Saturday.
The two 21-year-olds who have been charged were arrested in the Omagh area earlier on Friday.
To date, detectives investigating Mr McGovern's death have made six arrests.
A 21-year-old who was arrested on Wednesday was released on bail earlier this week.
A post-mortem examination concluded that Mr McGovern died from a serious head injury that was the result of the assaults.
