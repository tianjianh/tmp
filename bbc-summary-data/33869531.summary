Glan Clwyd maternity temporary downgrade 'preferred option'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A health board still wants a temporary downgrade for maternity services at a Denbighshire hospital as part of fresh plans for north Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is one of four options put forward by Betsi Cadwaladr health board at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan.
It had originally planned to reduce services to midwife-led care but then reversed the move as it faced a judicial review.
The new plans on a fresh consultation will be discussed next week.
The board blamed the maternity care decisions on problems recruiting safe numbers of staff, with the service heavily dependent on locums.
Other proposals now being put forward include keeping services as they are and continuing to manage current risks; temporary changes to to maternity services at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, and temporary changes to to maternity services Ysbyty Gwynedd.
However, temporary changes to maternity services at Glan Clwyd Hospital is the "preferred option".
The proposals will be discussed at an extraordinary board meeting next Tuesday and if they are approved by members, the public consultation will be launched on 24 August with the results expected to be presented to the board in November.
