The LSE said the course will be run by its Centre for Women, Peace and Security, launched last year by Ms Jolie and Lord Hague.
The pair co-founded a global initiative to tackle sexual violence in conflict zones in 2012.
It followed a 2011 film Ms Jolie directed depicting the Bosnian war.
Her directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, was set against the backdrop of the 1992-95 Bosnian war in which an estimated 20,000 women were believed to have been raped.
"It is vital that we broaden the discussion on how to advance women's rights and end impunity for crimes that disproportionately affect women, such as sexual violence in conflict," Ms Jolie, a special envoy for the UN refugee agency, said.
"I am looking forward to teaching and to learning from the students, as well as to sharing my own experiences of working alongside governments and the UN."
The former Foreign Secretary Lord Hague will also be joining LSE as a visiting professor.
