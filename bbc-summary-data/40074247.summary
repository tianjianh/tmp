Jake Ball: Scarlets lock out of Wales summer tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scarlets second row Jake Ball has been ruled out of Wales' two Tests against Tonga and Samoa in June because of a shoulder injury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ball missed Scarlets' win over Munster in the Pro12 final in Dublin.
Team-mate Samson Lee hurt his knee in Saturday's 46-22 victory but the region's head coach Wayne Pivac said it is too early to know the full extent of the prop's injury.
Wales face Tonga in Auckland on 16 June, then Samoa in Apia on 24 June.
Uncapped full-back Phil Dollman is also a concern for the tour after suffering an injury in Exeter's Premiership final win over Wasps.
Scarlets captain Ken Owens, who missed the Pro12 final and semi-finals with an ankle injury, says he is fit for the British and Irish Lions' tour of New Zealand.
"I'm as good as gold," the hooker told the BBC's Scrum V.
"I'm glad to be going on the tour after an injury scare a fortnight ago."
