Andrew Selby: Welsh fighter's next scheduled bill postponed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A boxing bill in Cardiff headlined by Craig Kennedy's attempt to win the British cruiserweight title has been postponed by the promoters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kennedy's scheduled opponent, Matt Askin and stand-in Stephen Simmons have both withdrawn, prompting Cyclone Promotions to postpone the event.
British and WBC international flyweight title holder Andrew Selby was due to fight on the undercard.
Selby beat Ardin Diale to win the WBC's International belt on 4 February.
Selby, the younger brother of current World IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby, is Wales' most successful amateur boxer.
The 28-year-old has said he will be ready for a tilt at a world title after 10 professional outings.
