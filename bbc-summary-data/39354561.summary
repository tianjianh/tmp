[SN]TITLE[SN]
Baby 'could have been saved by quicker treatment'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 10-month-old baby could have been saved if he had been given "competent and timely care" from hospital staff, his mother has told an inquest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leo Stacey was taken to Luton and Dunstable Hospital in 2015 after vomiting repeatedly.
He died as the result of a problem with his bowel and viral gastroenteritis before he could be treated further.
His mother said staff had not taken her concerns seriously, had failed to diagnose her son or to rehydrate him.
Nathalie Aubry-Stacey, from Harpenden in Hertfordshire, said: "I firmly believe that if Leo had received competent and timely care, he would not have died and Marc and I and the rest of the family would not have been left scarred and devastated by these events.
"There was ample information that Leo needed to be referred to a paediatric surgeon but this was not done in a timely manner."

She told Ampthill Coroner's Court her son was not adequately rehydrated and there had been a delay in transferring him to Great Ormond Street Hospital for further care.
He died on 6 October 2015, before he could be taken there.
Dr Jeremy Pryce, a paediatric pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination, said tests showed Leo was suffering from an intussusception of the bowel - a condition where part of the intestine folds into another section, causing an obstruction, and viral gastroenteritis.
He said it was impossible to say which came first and what the cause was.
Dr Pryce also said Leo's body weighed 14% less than the last time he was weighed, which would be "in keeping with dehydration".
The hearing continues.
