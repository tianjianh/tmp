The Aurora Borealis, better known as the Northern Lights, has been photographed from Peel Castle on the west coast of the Isle of Man.

Local photographer Ron Strathdee captured the phenomenon on Monday at about 23:30 BST.
The glow is usually best seen from northern latitudes like Norway, Alaska, Iceland and northern Scotland.
Mr Strathdee said seeing the Northrn Lights from Manx latitudes was "fairly unusual."
They happen when incoming solar radiation hits the earth's upper atmosphere and excites atoms to a new energy state, emitting energy in the form of light.
The photographer said: "I needed a place that faced north so went to Peel Hill and tried some shots over the castle which worked but half the fishing boats in the Irish Sea were discharging fish at the breakwater with enough floodlights to cover a football match!
"Going round the front of the castle it was pitch dark and it looks straight north which was where the photos were taken."
