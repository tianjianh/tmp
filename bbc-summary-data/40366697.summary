The man, who has been been suspended by the University of Cape Town, is alleged to have set up a live link in a private room at the institution on 13 June.
The woman wrote in a blog she was angry that providing food for her baby was "sexualised in such a cowardly way".
The man has been charged and further investigations are being carried out.

Western Cape police have confirmed that a case of crimen injuria - the intentional harming of someone's dignity - is being investigated against the 38-year old university employee.
Local media quoted the mother sharing her "disgust" at the act.  She had been in what she thought was a "safe, locked space" expressing milk, when she noticed that she was being filmed.
"I'm disgusted that we live in a world where mothers, no matter how they choose to feed their children, are victimised for being vulnerable."
There has been a global push for companies to provide special areas for women to breastfeed.
