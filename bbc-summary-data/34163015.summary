Cyclists are to ride through a West Sussex seaside town to celebrate the life of a bike enthusiast stabbed in a suspected "road-rage" attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donald Lock, 79, died from multiple stab wounds on the A24 in Findon after his car collided with another vehicle on 16 July.
Worthing Excelsior Cycling Club, where he was a member for over 50 years, is organising the ride.
Matthew Daley, 34, of St Elmo Road, Worthing, has been charged with murder.
Cyclists from the club led Mr Lock's funeral procession to Worthing Crematorium on 12 August.
President Robert Downham said the route of Sunday's ride, from Goring Gap to Wiston Village Hall, was designed to allow as many people as possible to take part.
"We have made it short enough so people who aren't keen cyclists can tag along - the seafront is fairly flat anyway.
"The idea is to ride as a mass group to start off with and then split into smaller groups when we get to Lancing."
Mr Downham said Mr Lock would always be remembered at the cycling club.
"He had held various positions within the committee and he was always there to help people," he said.
"You could always go to him for assistance and advice on what you planned to do and how best to achieve it.
"He did a lot of racing himself and a lot of our club records still stand with his name on them.
"His last few roles were social secretary, magazine editor and press officer so, even though he wasn't racing, he was still involved heavily with the organisation of the club."
Mr Daley is also accused of possessing a knife in a public place. He is currently on remand in prison and due to appear at Hove Crown Court on 25 September.
