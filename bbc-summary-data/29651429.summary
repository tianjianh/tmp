Watford situation is 'strange', admits manager Slavisa Jokanovic

New boss Slavisa Jokanovic has admitted it is "a little strange" that he is Watford's fourth head coach in 37 days.

Beppe Sannino, Oscar Garcia and Billy McKinlay all had stints in charge this term before the former Chelsea midfielder took charge last week.
"The situation is a little bit strange. But it's not the players' fault," the Serb told BBC Three Counties Radio.
"I am looking at what is in front of us. I expect the team to find stability with me and they are ready to go."
Former Fulham coach and Blackburn midfielder McKinlay had only been in charge for eight days before being replaced by Jokanovic on 7 October.
Sannino had quit the Hornets on 31 August and Garcia stepped down 29 days later for health reasons.
But despite that remarkable turnover, Watford are third in the Championship, level on points with the top two.
"This is part of football. Some guys lose their job and some guys find a job," said 46-year-old Jokanovic, who led Partizan Belgrade to consecutive Serbian doubles in 2008 and 2009.
"I try to understand it and I am trying to look at what is in front of me."
Jokanovic arrives at Vicarage Road with a reputation for playing possession football, but he expects to have to adapt that style for the Championship.
"If somebody thinks I've arrived here to make a small Barcelona, they are wrong," he said ahead of this weekend's trip to face Sheffield Wednesday.
"I am in England. My team and me we are going to compete in the Championship and I respect this competition.
"We are optimists and believe we can have a good season and be in contention. There are many games in front of us."
