[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 3-2 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Robbie Neilson's MK Dons picked up their first win in three League One games to see out 2016 on a high after beating fellow strugglers Swindon at Stadium MK.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Dons were ahead with only nine minutes gone, Kieran Agard nodding home a loose ball after Nicky Maynard's stunning strike crashed off the crossbar.
And it was to get better for Dons, a second goal coming after 26 minutes when a defensive mix-up saw the ball fall kindly to Chuks Aneke. He picked out Agard who made no mistake in doubling his tally from close range.
Swindon pulled a goal back nine minutes later after a deep cross into the box found Luke Norris who squeezed the ball in.
But Samir Carruthers' neat through-ball saw Maynard extend the advantage once more, beating the offside trap to slot home his 100th career goal.
Swindon never gave up, setting up a nervy finale as Raphael Rossi Branco headed home with 25 minutes remaining, only to fall short and suffer a third defeat in four league outings.
