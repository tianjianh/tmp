Hayley Murdoch, 29, and Sheila Dixon, 71, both from Carlisle, died on Tuesday following the collision at Newby Cross.
The women were in a Kia Picanto which collided with a Ford Transit van at about 15:30 GMT.
Ms Murdoch was the mother of a three-year-old boy also in car. He is being treated in hospital in Newcastle along with the driver, a 74-year-old man.
They were all part of the same family.
A family statement said:  "Hayley was fiercely loyal to her boy as well as her family. The boy and me meant the world to her, she was beautiful inside and out.
"Sheila was a wonderful, generous, loving and very kind person - someone who was so loved and cherished within the family that the loss will be felt forever.
"Her memory will never be forgotten and she will always be missed by all that knew her."
The van driver, a 51-year-old man from Aspatria, was taken to hospital in Carlisle with minor injuries.
