The body of the 29-year-old, who performed under the name Rainy Boy Sleep, was found in County Sligo on 13 August.
He went missing last month after his car was found parked at Fanad Lighthouse, County Donegal.
Stephen's brother Sean said thieves had committed a "deplorable act".
"My brother's flat was broken into during the time that we were still hopeful that Stevie was going to come back to us safely," said Mr Martin.
"It was a callous and deplorable act and it only compounded our grief. It made the situation a whole lot worse than it already was."
A blue electric fender Stratocaster guitar, guitar amps, a Yamaha keyboard and a soundcard that Stephen used for live performances were among the items taken.
"To us these items are priceless," said Sean Martin. "They're mementos of Stevie that we really, really want back.
"He was a brother first and foremost, a friend and then a musician but a great musician at that."
The family were lucky still to have Stephen Martin's music, said his brother, but it would mean a great deal to have something physical like a guitar, an amp or a keyboard returned.
Mr Martin's home was broken into some time between 11 and 12 August, confirmed the PSNI.
"Sentimental items were stolen including an electric Stratocaster guitar, keyboard, a sum of money and assorted musical equipment," said police.
"Stephen's family would appreciate any help in locating these items."
