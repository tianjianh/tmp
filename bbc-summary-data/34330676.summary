[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has unveiled a series of plans he claims will solve England's housing crisis.

They include a housing investment bank and allowing councils to borrow up to Â£7bn extra to fund new homes.
He also vowed to tear up parliamentary conventions in an effort to block David Cameron's plan to sell-off housing association properties.
He will use his party conference speech later to make housing his top campaigning priority, aides say.
Mr Farron will tell activists in Bournemouth: "Access to affordable housing affects us all because it is the entry ticket to society: to security and stability, to work, health and community."
He will say he was inspired to get into politics as a teenager by watching a repeat of the 1966 film Cathy Come Home, a ground-breaking drama documentary on homelessness that led to the foundation of the charity Shelter.
"Housing is the biggest single issue that politicians don't talk about," Mr Farron will say.
"Well, we are going to talk about it, campaign on it, go on and on and on about it, and make a difference to the millions who have been ignored.
"Communities up and down this country have spent 25 years building housing association homes, picking up the pieces of Mrs Thatcher's destruction of council housing, and we will not allow David Cameron to destroy that work too."
Mr Farron says he will instruct Lib Dem peers in the House of Lords to block David Cameron's plan to give housing association tenants the right to buy their homes.
It was one of Mr Cameron's flagship policies at the general election but critics, including former Lib Dem minister Ed Davey who compared it to a Robert Mugabe-style land-grab, say it will hit those in housing need.
Voting against right-to-buy would break the long-standing agreement, known as the Salisbury convention, that prevents peers from blocking government manifesto commitments.
But the Lib Dem leader told Sky News: "The Salisbury convention is a gentleman's pact between the old, established parties."
He said he was "on the side" of communities and "not on the side of any political stitch-up".
Other Lib Dem policies aimed at solving the housing shortage include:
The Labour government in Wales has said it will abolish the right-to-buy if it wins the 2016 Assembly election.
Welsh Liberal Democrats say they will retain it for existing tenants but are against any extension.
The right-to-buy has already been abolished in Scotland and there is no borrowing cap for local authorities.
Mr Farron will also use his conference speech to praise the Lib Dems' record in government, and defend the party's decision to go into coalition with the Conservatives.
"We paid a heavy price for our time in government, but we did right by the country," he will tell activists, and say he is "proud" of the past five years.
He will say the party remains committed to abolishing the structural deficit by 2017-18 - but not on the back of the poorest and lowest paid, saying: "We must all play our part, based on our ability to pay."
Mr Farron is also to pledge that the Lib Dems will be the champion of small business.
He will tell conference: "Liberals must be on the side of business - ambitious for business - tearing down the barriers that stop businesses from fulfilling their ambitions."
