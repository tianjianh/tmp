The 32-year-old Australian stand-off moved to Saints in 2014 from Hull KR for Â£60,000 but has struggled for game time this year, making five outings.
Burns started his career at Manly Sea Eagles and has played for Penrith Panthers and North Queensland Cowboys.
"Travis will add huge experience to our squad," Leigh head coach Neil Jukes told the club website.
"He will no doubt enhance the culture and standards off the field just as much as on it."
