Delays ease as A1 sinkhole at Gateshead repaired

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sinkhole which opened up on the A1 on Tyneside and brought delays to tens of thousands of motorists has been repaired, highways officials have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 5m (16ft) wide, 3m (10ft) deep crater appeared on Saturday night under the northbound carriageway near the Gateshead MetroCentre.
The road, which carries about 90,000 vehicles a day, was immediately closed between junctions 67 and 68.
Highways England said repairs had been completed and the road had reopened.
The hole was thought to be related to former mine workings.
Tyne Tunnel tolls on the nearby A19, which were suspended during the repair process, are now back in force.
