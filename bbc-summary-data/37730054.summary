The 33-year-old former Kent man took 32 wickets and made 832 runs for Hampshire last season.
He has played two Tests, 12 T20s and 54 one-day internationals for his country, but has not played for them since 2014.
"I'm looking forward to being a part of the squad in all competitions and hopefully win some more silverware for the club," McLaren said.
Lancashire head coach and cricket director Ashley Giles added: "He will certainly add depth to our seam bowling department, but will also give us balance with the bat too."
