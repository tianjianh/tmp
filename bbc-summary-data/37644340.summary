Gordon Strachan: Scottish Premiership bosses back Scotland manager

Scotland manager Gordon Strachan is under fire following a poor opening to the World Cup qualifying campaign.

Following Saturday's 1-1 draw at home to Lithuania, the national side slumped to a damaging 3-0 loss in Slovakia on Tuesday.
It leaves Scotland fourth in Group F after three matches, three points behind leaders England, with a visit to Wembley next up on 11 November.
Having failed to reach an extended European Championship, pressure is mounting on the 59-year-old, who agreed a two-year contract in the summer.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Strachan has received emphatic backing from fellow managers in the Scottish Premiership.

"Gordon is an excellent manager with big experience.
"I don't know Gordon that well but I think he's perfectly suited to be the manager of Scotland.
"Wonderful experience as a manager. He's shown at many clubs, including this club here that he can get the best out of players.
"There's maybe deeper rooted issues and problems in Scottish football. But I haven't been here long enough to see what they might be.
"But when you're the manager you're always under the spotlight. He's a good guy whenever I've spoken to him and he's certainly got a good knowledge of football both domestic and international."

"It saddens me and angers me, this clamour from certain people saying Gordon should lose his job.
"We've appointed a manager for this campaign and, while the momentum is important in groups, we are still capable of qualifying.
"I don't even think we need to win at Wembley. A positive result there would help.
"We should get behind the manager. We should get behind the team. I understand criticism but we've only lost one game.
"Gordon was the right man for the job and he's still the right man."

"We are still in the group. We still have a chance of qualifying.
"There is a huge game coming up at Wembley so let's try and get behind the team and not be too negative about it. It's easy to be negative but harder to be positive.
"Negativity is not helping anyone at all. I hope Gordon is still in charge. He has done a good job. Everybody talks about changing this and changing that. We are only three games into a campaign. But we are already talking about not qualifying.
"It's disappointing. In years gone by we were going into campaigns hoping and expecting to qualify. Now there is a negativity that is creeping in and it's not doing anyone any good. Be positive.
"We have a lot of good young players coming through. It's going to take time to develop. If you look at the Slovakian team, the midfield three are playing at Sampdoria, AC Milan and Napoli. They have ninety-odd caps and we expect to turn these teams over?
"I think our players are tested enough. In previous years young players weren't getting game time. They are now. Let's be patient and the team will come good. Things aren't going to change overnight."
