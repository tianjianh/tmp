Police said the incident happened on the Staffordstown Road, at its junction with Greenan Road, near Randalstown at about 16:40 GMT on Tuesday.
The two children were struck by a car that remained at the scene.
SDLP councillor Roisin Lynch said she understood the children were "brother and sister".
"This is a horrific experience for any family to go through. Local people are shocked.
"It it my understanding that they had just got off their school bus," she said.
Staffordstown Road has been closed in both directions between its junctions with Cranfield Road and Derrygowan Road.
Diversions are in place while police continue their enquiries. The PSNI have appealed for witnesses.
