Wardrobe death case: Care home must pay £150,000

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owner of a care home where an 80-year-old woman was found dead under a fallen wardrobe has been ordered to pay £150,000 after being prosecuted.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomasina Bennett was temporarily staying at Milford House in Derbyshire while her daughters went on holiday.
The wardrobe had not been fastened to the wall, but the home was cleared of a safety charge relating to this.
Gerald Hudson, trading as Milford House, was instead convicted of a charge relating to monitor alarms.
The personal activity monitor alarms (PAMs) were supposed to alert staff if residents got up in the night - but Mrs Bennett's alarm did not go off.
Margaret Calladine, Mrs Bennett's elder daughter, said they chose the home because it used these monitors.
"When we were talking to the manageress of the home we told her about my mum's problems and she assured us that my mum would be monitored at night if she got out of bed," Mrs Calladine said.
"That was the main reason that we chose that home to put her in because to us that was vital, because we knew that she would get out of bed because she did at home, and she would fall and she can't get herself back up."
Hudson, 72, from Ambergate, was fined £60,000 and ordered to pay £90,000 costs at Derby Crown Court.
He was cleared of failing to make a sufficient assessment of the risks of using free-standing furniture, which would have been a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act.
However, he was found guilty of a breaching the act by failing to suitably assess the risks of using the PAMs, failing to ensure they were suitable for use, and failing to ensure employees were adequately trained to use them.
In a statement, Milford House Partnership said the PAMs were "bought in good faith from a specialist company who had provided them to other healthcare organisations including the NHS".
"Our staff were left absolutely devastated by the death of Thomasina Bennett," it said.
"We truly believed that by adding in extra safety measures that went above and beyond the industry standards, that we were extending our duty of care to our residents."
