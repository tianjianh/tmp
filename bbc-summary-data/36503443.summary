Police puppy named after dead bomb disposal expert

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A puppy training to detect explosives has been named after a bomb disposal expert who died in Afghanistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sgt Olaf Schmid, 30, from Truro in Cornwall, died disarming a bomb - the 65th device on his tour of duty - in 2009.
He was posthumously awarded the George Cross.
Now a police operations team have named a new German short-haired pointer after the sergeant in recognition of the work he carried out while on duty.
The new puppy's registration name is Calverkeys Olaf Schmid and he will be known as Oz.
Insp David Eddy, who is in charge of the dogs on Tri Force Operations for Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and Avon & Somerset Police, said naming the puppy after Sgt Schmid was appropriate.
"Olaf Schmid was suggested as soon as we identified the puppy as a potential explosives search dog.
"In the circumstances, naming a bomb detection dog after a decorated bomb disposal officer seemed to be the most appropriate choice and we were able to contact Olaf's mother and she agreed to us naming Oz in honour of her son."
