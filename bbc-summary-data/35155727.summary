Irishman Bertram Allen looked to have posted an unbeatable jump-off time of 30.45 seconds with Quiet Easy.
Whitaker, 55, clocked 32.05 on Viking but was awarded the title after 20-year-old Allen was disqualified because of blood on his horse.
Germany's Ludger Beerbaum was promoted to second spot on Chiara.
The rules specify mandatory disqualification if there is bleeding on the horse's flank, in the mouth or nose, or marks indicating excessive use of the spur or whip.
Allen appealed but a committee upheld the disqualification.
Another German, Marcus Ehning, moved to third aboard Gin Chin van het Lindenhof.
Switzerland's former world number one Pius Schwizer had made a flying start to the show's final at Olympia by winning the thrilling Holly Speed Stakes.
Just 60-hundredths of a second separated the top-four finishers in the one-round speed class.
Schwizer recorded a time of 52.34 on Leonard de la Ferme to edge out Irish 2012 Olympic bronze medallist Cian O'Connor, riding Coco II.
Britain's Ben Maher, a London 2012 team gold medallist and runner-up in Sunday's World Cup Jumping qualifier, was the last of 22 starters aboard Quabble, but though he tested Schizer's time he had to settle for fourth place in 52.94.
There was also a disqualification earlier in the International Six Bar competition, affecting Norway's Victoria Gulliksen, who had tied for victory with Spain's Eduardo Alvarez Aznar.
Organisers said that 23-year-old Gulliksen had entered the competition when the rules had specifically stated that she was only invited to take part in Olympia's Alltech Puissance event last Thursday.
