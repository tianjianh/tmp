The 54-year-old replaces Adam Murray, who left the League Two side on Monday.
Evans was sacked by Championship club Leeds United in May and was also in contention for the vacant managerial role at Charlton Athletic.
"We're going to live and breathe this project. It's a very passionate management team that the fans have got," said Evans.
Paul Raynor, who has assisted Evans at several clubs, has been appointed as assistant manager to Evans, who said the Stags were still looking to win promotion this season despite being 18th in the table.
They have won only one of their last 11 matches, but are three points off both the relegation zone and the play-off places.
Chairman John Radford said: "Steve's resume is among the best in the English Football League and his appointment underlines the club's high ambitions.
"The club is geared for success from top to bottom and we have every confidence in Steve to fulfil the club's potential."
Evans started his managerial career in non-league football, and took Boston United from the Southern League to the Football League.
During a five-year spell with Crawley Town, he won two promotions and was also twice promoted with Rotherham United.
