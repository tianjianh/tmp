The plans include constructing at least three new stores and refurbishing or relocating existing outlets.
It also wants to relocate its Scottish Regional Distribution Centre (RDC) in Livingston to a larger site in Armadale in 2016.
It is seeking permission from West Lothian Council for the move.
Two of the planned stores are scheduled to open in Edinburgh in the autumn, while the third will be based in the west of Scotland.
Lidl already employs about 1,800 people in Scotland.
Lidl's managing director in Scotland, Ross Millar, said: "We're focused on one single goal - ensuring our customers receive the freshest, highest quality products possible at the best value.
"This latest phase in our growth is a testament to the continuing success of Lidl in Scotland."
The decision to expand the Scottish RDC follows four consecutive years of growth for Lidl in the UK.
Turnover reached Â£3.3bn in 2013 and sales have increased by 20% over the past 12 months.
