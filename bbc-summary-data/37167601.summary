A pre-inquest hearing into the Shoreham air crash deaths is "likely to be delayed", a coroner has said.

The review had been arranged for 19 September but is expected to be postponed until after a High Court case in October.
A judge is to decide whether to release key evidence from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch to Sussex Police.
Eleven men died when a vintage jet crashed onto traffic on the A27 next to Shoreham air show last August.
West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the full inquest, due in March, could also be delayed.
Ms Schofield said: "Everything depends on the High Court hearing due in October - that has to come first.
"Sussex Police then need their experts to look at any evidence that emerges and the CPS need to make a decision on whether any prosecution is appropriate."
The pilot, Andrew Hill, 51, survived and is being investigated for manslaughter.
On Monday, hundreds of people joined in a minute's silence to mark the first anniversary of the disaster.
