Mr Corbyn spoke to the BBC's Norman Smith as he arrived to take part in an economics seminar in central London, shortly after former Labour leader Tony Blair warned the party against moving to the left.
On Tuesday a former aide to Mr Blair said the MPs who nominated the left-winger to encourage debate were "morons".
But Mr Corbyn said Labour was having "the most democratic election there has ever been" to decide who takes over as leader.
