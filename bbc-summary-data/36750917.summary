The Indian businessman said both drivers were under contract for 2017.
Mallya added: "They are a fine pair, both absolutely top class. I always try to hire the best drivers we can afford. I am very happy with 'Checo' and Nico."
Perez had been linked with Ferrari, who announced on Friday they had re-signed Kimi Raikkonen as Sebastian Vettel's team-mate for 2017.
Mallya, who cannot travel as a result of his passport being suspended because of a financial dispute with Indian authorities, said: "Of course today's announcement by Ferrari put to rest a lot of speculation that had been taking place over the last few weeks."
