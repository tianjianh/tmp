The striker had come close with a header before Louis Moult nodded the visitors into a second-half lead from Chris Cadden's superb delivery.
But Miller headed the hosts level from Martyn Waghorn's sumptuous cross.
Well almost went ahead again through Carl McHugh and Scott McDonald but Miller had the final say, finishing well from Emerson Hyndman's pass.
Rangers dominated the ball for long periods without really unlocking the Motherwell defence.
Wingers Barrie McKay and Michael O'Halloran, the latter the subject of interest from Well, too often failed to provide a telling delivery while full-backs Lee Hodson and Lee Wallace also got into advanced areas with little success.
The only clear chances of the first half came from set pieces, Andy Halliday's delivery headed on to the top of the crossbar by Miller and Jason Holt having a volley blocked by the visiting defence.
O'Halloran claimed unsuccessfully for a penalty following Steven Hammell's challenge and the winger was further frustrated after the break when he had a shot blocked.
McKay had the beating of Richard Tait on several occasions and saw a shot drift past after cutting in from the left.
Motherwell had sat in throughout the first half with Joe Chalmers pulling a shot wide in one of their few advances.
However, they showed more attacking intent early in the second period and it was the turn of the Rangers defence to have some nervous moments as crosses rained in towards lone striker Moult from Hammell and Cadden.
The introduction of McDonald in place of Chalmers gave the hosts a different threat to deal with and the Australian former Celtic striker soon drew a save from Wes Foderingham.
In Moult, Motherwell possessed the presence and finishing prowess their hosts' had appeared to lack.
The striker had been isolated for much of the match but needed just one chance to show his worth.
Cadden swung an inviting cross in from the right and the Englishman towered above Hodson to beat Foderingham.
It looked as though Well manager Mark McGhee's tactics had paid off but Waghorn - on for O'Halloran - had other ideas, lifting a left-foot cross from the right on to the head of Miller for the leveller.
A frantic finale ensued as McHugh and then McDonald were denied in quick succession by Foderingham.
Hyndman - signed on loan from Bournemouth earlier this month - came on for Holt and set up Rangers' winner with a pass through to Miller, whose composure was exemplary.
McKay had two more efforts and Moult fired wide as last season's finalists progressed.
Rangers manager Mark Warburton: "I'm delighted we're through. I thought we deserved to win the game of football but you find yourself 1-0 down with 15 minutes to go so that is the harsh reality of it.
"The positives were we passed the ball well. But we never penetrated, we never tested their keeper and we didn't have enough bravery in the final third.
"All credit to Motherwell - they were very hard working, very well organised and well marshalled. Our goals came late because that is when their players tire. Again two late goals is credit to our team, to their fitness and their desire.
"It was two quality finishes, a great ball in from Waggy and then the composure and the poise from Kenny. The second is a great ball in from Emerson and he finishes it with aplomb so it is no coincidence. It is the way he [Miller] works on the training field, the way he eats. It is all credit to him and the senior players."
Motherwell manager Mark McGhee: "I am speechless. I've only ever felt as bad as this twice in my 900-odd games as a manager.
"Once at Millwall when we lost in the play-offs and the other time at Wolves when we lost to Crystal Palace in the play-offs. These are the only games that match how I'm feeling right now.
"Nobody has said anything after the game, nobody had any to say. I couldn't speak for half-an-hour."
