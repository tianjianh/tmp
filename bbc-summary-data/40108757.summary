Peter Betham has left Leicester Tigers less than five months after signing a new deal and joined Clermont Auvergne.

The Australia winger, 28, has agreed a two-year contract with the French side, starting in July.
Betham seemingly committed to Tigers in January, saying: "I have found a home here and wouldn't want to be anywhere else."
However, he has now opted to join the European Cup finalists, who hope to become French champions on Sunday.
Clermont play Toulon in the Top 14 final after last Saturday's 37-31 win over Racing 92.
When news of Betham's new contract at Welford Road was announced, he said: "I'm ecstatic. I am very humbled and blessed to be able to spend a couple more years here."
But in a statement on Clermont's website, announcing Betham's arrival, the French club's coach Franck Azema said: "Through our recruitment network, we learned that Peter could potentially be released from Leicester and join us. We seized this opportunity."
Confirming the move, Tigers head coach Matt O'Connor said: "We thank Peter for his contribution over the last two seasons with the club and we all wish him well in his new challenge with Clermont."
Betham, who has two international caps, joined Leicester in 2015 from Super Rugby's Waratahs.
He scored 11 tries in 55 appearances, including in the Premiership play-off defeat by Wasps.
