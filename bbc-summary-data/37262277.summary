[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham and Nottinghamshire settled for a draw after rain prevented any play on the final day at Chester-Le-Street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The perpetual downpour saw lunch called early and, following an inspection at 14:00 BST, the match was called off.
Relegation-threatened Notts picked up 11 points from the match, but they remain 33 points adrift of Durham and safety with two matches remaining.
The hosts stay sixth, three points behind fifth-placed Lancashire with a game in hand.
