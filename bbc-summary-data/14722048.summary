The move comes after the 30-year-old handed in a transfer request on Tuesday, stating that he wished to play in the Premier League.
Parker's switch across London is likely to trigger Wilson Palacios joining Stoke City.
Spurs have also announced that winger David Bentley will join the Hammers on a season-long loan.
Parker, who joined West Ham from Newcastle for £7m in 2007, was named Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year last season despite the club finishing bottom of the Premier League.
Spurs boss Harry Redknapp said of Parker: "He's a good player. I think he's what we need. He's a good lad, great attitude.
"Footballer of the Year last year and he'll be a good addition for this team - no doubt about that.
"He's a good character, a fantastic person, a proper family man, a real good pro. He'll be great around the place for us."
West Ham said they "reluctantly" agreed to the deal, despite their best attempts to keep him at Upton Park.
On the Hammers website, the club said: "West Ham United would like to place on record their thanks for Scott's efforts and wish him well for the future."
Bentley, who joined Spurs in July 2008 from Blackburn joins West Ham having made 62 appearances at White Hart Lane and scoring six times.
The out-of-favour midfielder spent the second half of last season on loan at Birmingham, clocking up 15 appearances.
Meanwhile, the Hammers boss Sam Allardyce took his summer tally to 11 signings with the arrivals of Arsenal midfielder Henri Lansbury, 20, on an initial season-long loan.
The England Under-21 international wants regular first-team football having failed to make the breakthrough with Arsenal.
He played 23 games on loan with Norwich last season as the Canaries earned promotion to the Premier League.
