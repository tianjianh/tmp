Aberdeen City Council pays £275,000 solar bill after panels switch-off

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberdeen City Council was left with a bill of more than £250,000 after having to switch off all its solar panels for health and safety reasons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is understood the decision was taken after three panels installed on council buildings overheated.
A report to the audit, risk and scrutiny committee details so-called "thermal events" in 2015.
The switch-off meant the panels did not generate any income for the contractor, so the council had to pay £275,000.
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) was notified and the council switched off all systems as a precautionary measure.
Fire risk assessments were carried out and work was undertaken to upgrade fire alarm systems and install fire detectors.
