The American lost a tooth and cracked another after being hit in the face by a camera while watching girlfriend and skier Lindsey Vonn race in Italy.
Woods, 39, said the injury was very painful and added that he could not eat or drink until the tooth was repaired.
The former world number one, who flew home to the United States to get fixed, even said "breathing hurt".
Woods said he suffered the facial injury when a cameraman, who was kneeling in front of him in the crowd, "stood up, turned and caught me square in the mouth".
Woods has not played since finishing joint last in an 18-man field in the Hero World Challenge in December.
The 14-time major winner said: "It's great to be back.
"Overall, I'm very pleased to go out there and hit shots. I'm cranking up the speed and it's going to be a fun year."
