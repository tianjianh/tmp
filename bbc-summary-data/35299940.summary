John Richards was seen on CCTV being doused with the traceable liquid by a security system at a business in Mill Street, Ludlow.

Police said it was the "first success" in an operation using covert technology to tackle burglaries in the area.

Richards was barefoot in a bid to creep around quietly but left footprints in the SmartWater UV paint which was found inside his boots and on a stolen cash box, police said.
Richards, from Dinham, Ludlow, pleaded guilty to burglary, escaping lawful custody and possessing cannabis in court 17 December.
He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment suspended for 12 months and ordered to do 100 hours community service and pay Â£900 costs and a Â£100 victim surcharge.
Det Ch Insp Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police, said: "Responding to a series of burglaries at businesses in Ludlow and the surrounding villages we partnered with SmartWater to protect premises.
"In this case the business had a movement sensitive system installed which sprays the whole room with the liquid.
"When you shine a UV torch on it, it glows bright green."
