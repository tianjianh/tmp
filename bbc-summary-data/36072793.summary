However, the five-time champion faces disciplinary action for refusing to do any post-match interviews.
O'Sullivan, who led fellow Englishman Gilbert 6-3 overnight, scored one century on his way to a 9-7 lead and finished the match with a stylish 72.
Welshman Mark Williams beat another former champion Graeme Dott 10-4.
The two-time title-winner is through to the second round at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre for the first time since 2012, while Dott's fellow Scot John Higgins dominated his opening session against Ryan Day from Wales, scoring three centuries to lead 7-2.
Another former champion, Mark Selby, scored five half-centuries and a brilliant 132 clearance as he recovered from 2-1 down to lead fellow Englishman Robert Milkins 7-2.
In the evening session, qualifier Sam Baird, the world number 59, secured a fine victory over Welshman Michael White.
Baird led 5-4 overnight and, despite falling 7-6 behind, he stormed through the final three frames with breaks of 54, 103 and 62.
Former World Championship semi-finalist Ricky Walden came from 5-4 down to beat fellow Englishman Robbie Williams 10-8.

Unsurprisingly, O'Sullivan once again took centre stage after refusing to fulfil his media obligations - a decision likely to lead to a fine from World Snooker.
O'Sullivan, who will face England's Barry Hawkins or China's Zhang Anda in the second round, may well lose some of the Â£22,000 he has already earned.
A World Snooker statement said: "All players have a responsibility to the sport, and in particular to their fans - this includes fulfilling media obligations at events. Any players found to be in breach of these rules will be referred to the disciplinary process."
The post-match debrief was left to world number 22 Gilbert, who said it was "probably the best he will play and not win a game of snooker".
The 34-year-old won the opening frame of the second session with two breaks of more than 50 to trail 6-4 - and his attacking style posed problems for his opponent throughout.
"It was an honour to play the legend that is Ronnie O'Sullivan," Gilbert said. "The guy is amazing. He wasn't quite on the top of this game, but his safety was brilliant.
"I have nothing to feel disgraced about. I gave it my all and it wasn't quite good enough. His all-round game is unbelievable."
