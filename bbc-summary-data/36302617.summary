Pro12 semi-final: Improving Ulster can topple Leinster - McWhirter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ulster will compete in the Pro12 semi-finals for the fourth consecutive season when they face Leinster at the RDS in Dublin on Friday night.

Ulster finished fourth in the table at the end of the regular season, with Leinster topping the standings.
Former Ulster back-rower, now BBC Sport NI analyst Tony McWhirter, offers his thoughts on the interprovincial derby.
Connacht entertain Glasgow Warriors at the Sportsground in Galway in the other semi-final on Saturday evening.
T McW: Ulster had the game won against Glasgow last year until a dubious decision by the Television Match Official saw the momentum and initiative swing towards the hosts.
History stacks up against Ulster in the sense that no away team has ever won a semi-final in the competition since they were introduced but I think Ulster are a better side than last year and this is the best chance they will have.
They are playing with confidence and winning matches and you can't underestimate the confidence that going on a run of wins brings, especially when a number of those have been away from home.
T McW: You have to take Leinster's big defeat at the Kingspan Stadium a couple of weeks ago into consideration but they will be a different proposition at the RDS.
It's a sell-out crowd and their coach Leo Cullen has been talking revenge, so that will be high on their priorities.
T McW: The game will be won up front, as these matches generally are, and Leinster have a very strong scrum.
Ulster must keep their discipline, listen to the referee, get him on side, and make sure it stays that way.
It could come down to a kicking contest between the two fly-halves, Johnny Sexton and Paddy Jackson, but I think the game will be a bit more open than that.
Both teams went into their last games of the regular season knowing that they had to score four tries to secure five points, which left some gaps and holes to exploit, but Ulster will have to tighten up their defence for this game, which I'm sure they are capable of doing.
Ulster will have to be as near flawless as they can in their execution, keeping errors to a minimum and taking their scoring chances.
T McW: There won't be an awful lot in it at the end but I think Ulster will win.
They have lost a few important matches in recent years and Leinster have been a bit of a bogey team for them but Ulster are a team on the up, while Leinster are maybe slightly the opposite.
Having experienced players will be important but it's a big stage for the younger players to shine too.
A lot of the younger players have been progessing well since the turn of the year, the likes of Peter Browne, Callum Black and Ricky Lutton, who are maybe unsung heroes, and don't attract a lot of headlines.
They have really come to the party and put themselves into consideration for Ireland by their good late season form.
Leinster have not always played to their potential in recent weeks, while Ulster not only beat an Ospreys side who still had something to play for in their last game, they really put a score on them.
T McW: I fancy Glasgow to beat Connacht as the mitigating factor in their defeat in Galway a few weeks ago was that they had a man sent-off after 50 minutes when the score was 7-7.
Glasgow move the ball well and coach Gregor Townsend is very cute with how he tweaks his team selection. They also have experience of winning a competition and that counts for a lot.
Connacht's season has been a real fairytale and they probably deserve to be in the final given how they have performed all season but whether they can go that extra step I don't know, it might be just too much for them.
