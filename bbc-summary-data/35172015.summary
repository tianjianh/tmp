The victim was walking on the Donegall Road near the junction with the Falls Road when he was involved in the collision shortly before 19:30 GMT.
West Belfast MP Paul Maskey said: "My thoughts go to this gentleman's family.
"There's no good time of the year for anyone to be knocked down, but especially this time of year just adds that extra bit of sadness."
Mr Maskey said the man was a "well known member of the community around the greater St James's area" and was "well respected and well loved".
"We're now left with a fatality on our roads - it's unfortunate that his life has had to end in this way."
Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the collision to contact them.
The Donegall Road has reopened.
Earlier on Wednesday, another pedestrian died after he was struck by a lorry in County Down.
