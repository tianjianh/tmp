Hooker Dwyer, 21, joins the Broncos on a one-year loan deal while prop Riley, also 21, moves to the capital on a permanent one-year contract.
Dwyer has made 10 appearances for Warrington this season, while Riley has featured 12 times.
"They will match the culture we are creating here," Broncos head coach Joey Grima said.
Dwyer, who signed a new two-year contract with Warrington this summer, had a spell on loan at Huddersfield last season.
He and Riley both came through the Warrington Academy and both played for Swinton Lions on dual-registration terms.
"Both these players have been prominent in the Championship and Super League," Grima added.
"Coming from the Warrington system under Tony Smith ensures that the standards will be high in both players.
"I've been impressed by both Brad and Glenn as their level of maturity exceeds their actual age and they will help us build the culture at the Broncos."
