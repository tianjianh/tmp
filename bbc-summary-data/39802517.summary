Judge to Waymo: Close, but no smoking gun

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
"So far you don’t have a smoking gun."

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Not the words Waymo’s legal team wanted to hear from a judge in San Francisco on Wednesday, but hear them it did as it was scolded for not having enough evidence to prove its claims.
That case, if you’ve not been following, is that Uber stole trade secrets from Waymo - a company spun out of Google’s self-driving division. For the full background on that, I'd suggest reading this piece, as I’m keen to focus now on the new things we learned in court.
This was the first time lawyers for both Uber and Waymo were able to square up against each other, and the question for the hearing was whether or not a preliminary injunction should be put in place immediately to prevent Uber from using or developing the disputed technology while the trial continued.
Judge William Alsup, something of a fan favourite for his ability to cut through legalese and technical jargon, pushed for a substantial part of the hearing and as much documentation as possible to be made public.
Because of this, I and other reporters were given a glimpse into what Waymo believes was a grand plot to steal its innovation.

Waymo has not been able to search Mr Levandowski’s personal laptop - or even question him about it - as he is invoking his Fifth Amendment rights, the part of US law that means people can not be forced to incriminate themselves.
So now the next steps are:
Finally, we might see Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, take the stand.
“No-one is hiding at Uber,” the company said.
