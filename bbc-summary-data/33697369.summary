A residential school for boys with emotional and behavioural problems has been temporarily closed while police investigate physical abuse claims.

The principal of Chelfham Mill in Barnstaple said it would stay shut for at least six weeks, and Ofsted has suspended its registration to operate.
The privately-run school provides residential and day care for 41 pupils aged seven to 18.
Chelfham Mill normally provides some day care during the summer.
Councils have been instructed by Ofsted to find alternative provision for boys in their care while the investigation takes place, and parents have been informed of the situation.
In a statement, Devon and Cornwall Police said officers were "working closely with partner organisations including social services as this investigation takes place".
The principal of the school, Katy Roberts, said: "The school has been closed for an initial period of six weeks pending investigation by an external agency, but I can assure you I am committed to supporting the investigation process."
An Ofsted spokesperson said: "Ofsted has suspended the registration of the setting pending further inquiries - this will be kept under review as the investigation continues."
Alistair Dewhirst, Devon county councillor for Teignbridge South, told BBC News he had asked the chief executive of the council for an urgent report about the "scandal" at the school.
He said he had previously raised safeguarding issues with the authority.
Mr Dewhirst has asked the council how many children are affected by the closure and for an "assurance that they are now in a safe location".
He also questioned "what will be done to make our inspection regime robust enough to ensure that this sort of Dickensian scandal does not happen again".
Devon County Council said in a statement: "Private schools are registered and regulated by Ofsted. We have worked with Chelfham Mill in the past to help them make improvements following Ofsted inspections.
"Senior officers are preparing a reply to Mr Dewhirst's questions."
The regulator's latest report on Chelfham Mill, in February 2015, found young people were not being adequately safeguarded and the school had "declined in effectiveness".
"The senior leadership team are not successfully managing this home," it said.
The school's "mission statement" is to "provide a secure, caring environment in which each boy can realise his full educational and social capabilities and become a better adjusted individual ready to cope successfully with life's demands".
