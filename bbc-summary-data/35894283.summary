Creative Skillset Cymru, based in Cardiff, works in areas such as film, television, radio, fashion, animation, games and advertising.
The organisation, which has managed a number of Welsh Government projects, said "difficult decisions" on resources had to be made.
Creative Skillset will also close its Scotland and Northern Ireland offices.
Speaking to BBC Radio Cymru's Post Cyntaf, Rhodri Talfan Davies, director of BBC Wales and chairman of Creative Skillset Wales' national advisory board, described the closure as "a blow".
He added: "This is obviously disappointing news, Creative Skillset - which is a British body - plays a key part in delivering the training needs of the creative industries. This is a sector that by now employs about 40,000 people and the chances to grow during the next few years are enormous.
"So we have immediately set up a work committee to look at how we can save the situation and ensure stability for the team."
