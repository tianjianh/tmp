Nottingham tram extension: First station opens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The first stop on Nottingham's new Â£570m tram lines has opened to the public.

It serves the railway station and is only yards from the original stop, which is now closed for refurbishment.
Work to extend the Chilwell and Clifton lines began in March 2013 and is expected to finish in the coming weeks.
Nottingham Express Transport (NET) called the opening a "milestone" and said staff would be on hand to direct customers to new exits and entrances.
Construction of the new lines - which is eight months behind schedule - has been dogged by complaints over traffic disruption and impact on local businesses.
Last week a sign at one of the yet-to-be-opened stations had to be replaced after it misspelt the location.
Jamie Swift, NET Marketing Manager said: "NET staff will be on hand to offer customers help and support as the new arrangements bed in.
"The changeover is also important in terms of our testing and commissioning programme ahead of the launch of the new network.
"In order to mimic the way services will operate in the future, customers will see plenty of trams displaying Toton Lane or Clifton South as their destination over the coming weeks."
