Everton 3-4 Stoke City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Xherdan Shaqiri scored one of the goals of the season as Stoke earned a thrilling win at Everton through Marko Arnautovic's injury-time penalty.

The Potters led through Shaqiri early on and after Romelu Lukaku levelled from eight yards, the Swiss looped a stunning half-volley over Tim Howard.
Lukaku struck again after the break and Gerard Deulofeu tapped Everton ahead.
But Joselu volleyed his first Premier League goal and Arnautovic won it after being brought down by John Stones.

Arnautovic - impressive himself throughout - will be deemed the match winner, but Shaqiri's strike will capture copious column inches in the aftermath of a win which moves Stoke two places above Everton and into ninth.
An ex-Inter Milan and Bayern Munich forward, summer-signing Shaqiri perhaps symbolises the ambition Mark Hughes' side now have and his first goals for the club will raise hopes of many more to come.
Stoke kept eight clean sheets in the 11 league games leading up to this win and although their frugal side went missing at Goodison Park, flair at the other end was on show throughout.
Shaqiri's first from six yards saw the combination of Bojan and Arnautovic craft a sublime team goal, while his second - from a wonderful Bojan pass - saw him reach for the ball and clip it over Tim Howard and into the top corner from 18 yards.
"That is the best goal I have seen this season," said Final Score pundit Garth Crooks. "He knew exactly what he was doing, it is absolutely sublime."
Everton had lost just once in eight league games before kick-off but with no back-to-back wins in the league this season, their fans could be forgiven for wishing their side packed the killer punch Stoke mustered on Merseyside.
Hughes made no changes to his squad despite a 48-hour turnaround from Saturday's win over Manchester United but the likes of Ibrahim Afellay and Glenn Whelan delivered displays of note, both completing 95% of their passes.
It briefly appeared that substituting Bojan moments before Lukaku pulled a long ball down to fire Everton level at 2-2 would prove key, but after falling behind, Stoke's fresh legs earned their manager a fifth league win in eight games.
Arnautovic delivered a telling cross for substitute Joselu to smash a smart volley home and picked himself up to slam a penalty down the middle despite slipping before making contact.
It was a fitting reward as no Stoke player completed more sprints than the Austrian's 54 in the game and although Shaqiri's brilliance will overshadow such work ethic, the Potters admirably married graft with quality.
Everton's industry and spirit are tough to question after they fought back to lead late on but they will rue the chance to close out the victory having led with just 10 minutes to spare.

There may be some contention around the winning penalty - referee Mark Clattenburg took an age to point to the spot - but even allowing Stoke back into the game having fought so hard to earn a lead was sloppy.
In all, Everton had 15 shots and as many crosses but the end result smacks of the inconsistency which continues to hamper their hopes of a push for a top-four spot.
At the halfway stage of the campaign, they are five points worse off than they were at the same point last season and the gap to Manchester City in fourth is now nine points.
Will Roberto Martinez regret making four changes to the side which won at Newcastle on Boxing Day? His introduction of James McCarthy into the side after a month out injured backfired as the midfielder limped off early on.
In Lukaku, they now boast the Premier League's joint top scorer with Jamie Vardy on 15, but three wins from 10 home matches this season is a damning statistic they must improve quickly if their final league position is to match their ambitions.
Everton manager Roberto Martinez on Stoke's penalty: "Looking at the replay it shows John Stones touches the ball. That decision is hard to take. To get a decision wrong like that so late in the game makes you feel furious and is unacceptable."
Stoke manager Mark Hughes: "The only thing lacking up until today for Shaqiri was goals - performances had been fine - but now he has added that. He has that quality - it's his first mark in terms of goals and I'm sure there will be more to come. It was end to end and I thought both sides came out with great credit."
Stoke can make it three wins from three if they win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday while Everton host Tottenham 24 hours later.
