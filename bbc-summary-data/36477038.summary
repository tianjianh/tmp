Mr Ingleton, said he could not get out of the way of the dog once it started chasing him.
After it grabbed him he tried to get his fingers inside the dog's mouth to prize himself free.
A woman who saw the incident came to help him and called an ambulance, he said, while the owner left in his car.
"Nothing like this [has] ever happened to me," Mr Ingleton said.
"I don't know why this dog attacked me."
He was taken to hospital after the incident for facial injuries and said he was fortunate they were not more serious.
