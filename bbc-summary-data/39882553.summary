The couple who live at the farm - both in their 60s - were assaulted while the three men searched the property.
A large amount of cash and jewellery was stolen before the robbers discovered the farmhouse's gun room.
The victims, who were locked in the gun room, required hospital treatment following the raid in West Handley, near Chesterfield, on 14 March.
Crimestoppers, which has offered the reward, said the theft of the guns was a "serious cause for concern".
The crime-fighting charity confirmed the robbers also stole a large amount of shotgun cartridges.
Lydia Patsalides, from Crimestoppers, said: "This violent burglary was immensely distressing for the victims.
"Not only was cash and valuable jewellery stolen, but the theft of such a large number of shotguns is a serious cause for concern.
"These people need to be found and the shotguns traced, before any further harm can be done."
