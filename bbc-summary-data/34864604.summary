Singapore born Ethan Koh grew up in his family's tanning business and for four generations they imported crocodile skins from Australia, Africa and the US, supplying the world's top fashion houses.
He has set out on his own and makes customised bags based out of London. He only produces 1,500 pieces a year.
As part of the Family Business series, Mr Koh talked to the BBC's Ali Moore about his exclusive line of leather handbags.
