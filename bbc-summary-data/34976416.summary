The 30-year-old made 160 NRL appearances for the Knights after joining the club from St George-Illawarra Dragons in 2008.
"I've loved my time in the NRL but I wanted a new challenge," he told the Widnes website.
"I'm coming here to do a job. Super League is always something I have wanted to experience."
