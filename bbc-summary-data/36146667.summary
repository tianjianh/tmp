Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores and Cleveland Cavaliers' Dan Gilbert are hoping to build a new stadium for the team in the downtown of the city.
In a statement, the pair said their proposal had won support from the MLS.
The league is aiming to increase its size from 20 to 24 teams by 2020 and then ultimately to 28.
"Detroit is rising and we know firsthand the power of sports to lift a community and drive a civic renaissance," read the Gores and Gilbert statement.
"We are very excited about the prospect of bringing Major League Soccer to Detroit and building an ownership group that represents a cross-section of investors."
Gilbert added: "Bringing a team downtown will also further energise Detroit's urban core, which is critical to the entire city's overall health and vibrancy."
David Beckham's Miami franchise is aiming to be one of the first quartet to join the league.
Miami Beckham United (MBU), the ownership vehicle behind the proposed MLS team, announced last week that the group had purchased the land needed to build a stadium.
