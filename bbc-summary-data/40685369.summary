Another Israeli was wounded in the attack in Halamish. The Israeli army says the attacker was shot and caught.
The attack came near the end of a day of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces over new security measures at a Jerusalem holy site.
Three Palestinians were killed and hundreds were hurt in East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said he is freezing all contacts with Israel after it installed metal detectors at the site, known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
Israel says the extra security is needed after two Israeli policemen were killed near the site a week ago.
Palestinians die in East Jerusalem clashes
On Friday, four Israeli civilians were stabbed in Halamish (also known as Neve Tsuf) after "an assailant infiltrated a private home", the Israeli army said.
Israeli media said the victims were two men and a woman. Another woman who was injured is being treated at hospital.
The Israeli army said the attacker was a young Palestinian man called Omar al-Abed.
He was taken to hospital, but his condition was unclear.
There has been a wave of stabbings, shootings and car-rammings of Israelis predominantly by Palestinians or Israeli Arabs since late 2015.
At least 47 Israelis and five foreign nationals have been killed in nearly two years of such attacks.
At least 255 Palestinians - most of them attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period, news agencies report. Others have been killed in clashes with Israeli troops.
Israel says Palestinian incitement has fuelled the attacks. The Palestinian leadership has blamed frustration rooted in decades of Israeli occupation.
Is Palestinian-Israeli violence being driven by social media?
