The victim was injured after a Volkswagen (VW) car in front of him stopped abruptly, forcing him to brake on Wash Lane, Bury, at 00:30 BST, police said.
Both drivers got out and the driver of the VW hit the victim's car with an axe and then his arm before he drove off.
The 35-year-old victim's injuries are not life-threatening, police said.
He is being treated in hospital.
Det Con Keith Holt said he was "appalled by the level of violence used" in the attack.
"This must have been terrifying for the man and his friends in the car," he said.
The suspect is white, of slim build, in his mid to late 20s, and wore a grey top, police said.
Det Con Holt appealed for witnesses and a female passenger seen in the silver VW to contact the force.
She is described as white, in her 20s with long hair.
