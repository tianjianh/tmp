Streaming service Netflix has postponed a Bill Cosby comedy special in the wake of allegations of sexual assault that have resurfaced in recent weeks.

Bill Cosby 77 was to have been streamed from 27 November. It is not clear when or if the special will now be shown.
Netflix's announcement came shortly after Tuesday's airing of an interview with a model and TV host who claimed Cosby sexually assaulted her in 1982.
Cosby's lawyer previously said the comedian would be making no comment.
John P Schmidt said the allegations were a "decade-old [and] discredited" and that he did not intend to "dignify [them] with any comment".
A follow-up statement amended the earlier denial to say it did not refer to Andrea Constand, an accuser whose civil action against him was settled in 2006.
The latest allegation came from TV presenter Janice Dickinson, who accused Cosby of sexually assaulting her after a dinner date in Lake Tahoe, California.
"The next morning I woke up and I wasn't wearing my pyjamas," she told Entertainment Tonight. "I remembered before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted."
Dickinson claimed she had written about the alleged assault in a 2002 autobiography but had been pressured by Cosby's lawyer and her publisher to remove the details.
Dickinson, a contestant in the 2007 series of I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, is one of several women to have accused Cosby of sexual assault going back almost 30 years.
Cosby remained silent during an NPR radio interview that aired on Saturday when he was asked to comment on the accusations levelled against him.
The veteran comedian is best known for playing Cliff Huxtable, benign patriarch of an African-American family in hit US sitcom The Cosby Show.
