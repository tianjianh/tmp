Forecasters have warned that there could be some torrential thundery showers, with the Highlands expected to have heavy rain on both days.
The warning has come as temperatures rise in Scotland for a second day.
BBC Scotland Weather said the temperature could reach 30C in the north Highlands. The Scottish record May temperature is 30.9C.
That was recorded in Inverailort in the Highlands five years ago.
Temperatures across large parts of Scotland were in the high 20s on Thursday.
May is traditionally seen as one of the best months for long spells of fine weather in Scotland.
