Swansea must back up their shock 2-1 win at Arsenal with victory over rivals Norwich City on Saturday, according to captain Ashley Williams.

Wales skipper Williams scored a 74th-minute winner at the Emirates Stadium to lift the Swans six points clear of the Premier League relegation places.
He feels they have to do the same again against the struggling Canaries.
"If we don't win that, we don't back up the win today, then we're back to square one," Williams told BBC Wales.
"Everyone was looking at the next three games, but after winning here we have to try and build on it and go into the Norwich game.
"It should give us the confidence to know we can beat a team that's going for the title so we can beat anyone.
"It's a massive win and we seem to enjoy coming here, for whatever reason."
Swansea have recorded three wins and a draw in their last four visits to the Emirates Stadium, and the result dented Arsenal's title aspirations as they missed a chance to move level with second-placed Tottenham.
Swansea's next three matches are all against teams in the bottom six - Norwich at home, Bournemouth away and bottom club Aston Villa at home.
Williams acknowledges their importance, but believes there is a lot of football to be played before the end of the season.
"It's just not the next three games," he added.
"There are five or six after that, that we can get points from - from now until the end of the season we need to get momentum, put runs together and get as many points as was can and get ourselves away from this situation."
First-team coach Alan Curtis took charge of the team against Arsenal after head coach Francesco Guidolin was admitted to hospital with a chest infection earlier on Wednesday.
Williams confirmed that the manager had sent the team a message before the game and that he had spoken to the Italian on the phone after the match.
"He's very happy so we wish him all the best, hopefully he's back in Swansea soon and it's just nice to get a win and cheer him up a little bit," added Williams.
"Hopefully we'll see him in Swansea on Friday."
