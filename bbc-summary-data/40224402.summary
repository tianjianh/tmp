Courtney Boyle and her mother's partner Philip Tron, 32, were killed in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May.
The pair had travelled from Gateshead to pick up her sister after the Ariana Grande concert.
Family and friends wore a splash of yellow for the private service at Saltwell Crematorium.
A minute's silence was held earlier at the start of the inquests into the 22 people who died in the attack.
Meanwhile a joint funeral service for 17-year-old Chloe Rutherford and Liam Curry, 19, both from South Shields, who were also killed in the attack, is to be held in the town on 15 June.
It will take place at St Hilda's Church, South Shields, followed by private cremations at South Tyneside Crematorium.
