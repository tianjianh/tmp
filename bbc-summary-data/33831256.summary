Things are just that little bit different at Belladrum festival

It happens at every festival/stadium concert.

There is the anthem that everyone knows word for word and loudly sings along to.
And at the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival just such a moment came early in the day on Friday.
"Ooooohâ€¦You cannae shove yer granny aff the bus," sang the crowd.
Belladrum prides itself in doing things a little bit different.
On the main Garden Stage were Fun Box, a colourful band of children's entertainers treading the same boards The Proclaimers had on Thursday night and less than seven hours before Manic Street Preachers would.
The wee unusual twists do not end with the festival's line up. Sat on the ruins of an old building, a white elephant with a purple cape that streamed from behind it in a breeze. Fittingly, within sight of this sculpture, the band Elephant Sessions were trying out new material to a packed-out audience in the Grassroots tent.
At the opposite end of the site were fake sheep up trees on the end of ladders and brightly-coloured umbrellas in an avenue of trees.
There were performers inside giant puppets of a horse and a golden Highland cow.
A roving band of Viking re-enactors launched a mock attack on children rolling around inside big inflatable balls, and a magician riding around on what looked like a modern version of a Penny Farthing bicycle while his little white rabbits munched grass in a little enclosure in front of the magic show tent.
Nearby, children made sock puppets with help from Highland Council rangers while yet more kids tried their hands at stilt-walking and riding unicycles.
In a big top there were wrestling matches, while across from there stunt bike rider Danny Macaskill and his friends wowed a crowd.
And everywhere there were people dressed to the festival's theme this year - superheroes.
There were children and adults dressed as the Hulk, Captain America, Bananaman, Groot from Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, Superman, Supergirl...and Hong Kong Phooey.
Following the traffic issues of Thursday, Belladrum was well and truly in full swing on Friday.
On the music front, Glasgow synthpop band Prides drew a big crowd to the Garden Stage, later followed by US band Hayseed Dixie.
But something strange was never far away.
Following the end of Hayseed Dixie's set, which featured Highway to Hell and then Banjo Duel from the horror film Deliverance, the crowd were stopped in their tracks when the theme music from Superman suddenly belted out from the main stage.
The tune was the signal for a flash mob dance organised by Inverness' Eden Court.
