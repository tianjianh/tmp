Leicester care home owners fined after woman's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The owners of a care home who had a "significant" role in the death of an elderly resident who fell from a first floor landing, have been fined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Marjorie Keogh, 89, died in hospital the day after the fall at Scraptoft Court, Leicester, in 2010.
Dinesh Gokani, 55, of Oadby, was fined £80,000 plus £30,000 in costs.
Helen Appleton, 53, of Leicester, was fined £40,000 plus £20,000 in costs. Both pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches in November.
On 6 February 2010, Mrs Keogh is believed to have lost her balance and then fallen backwards onto the first floor banister, which gave way, causing her to land on the ground floor below.
An inquest concluded that she died the next day of pneumonia, due to multiple injuries, as a result of the fall.
Leicester Crown Court heard the banister had not been fit for purpose and had the British Standard been complied with, it would not have failed.
Business partners Appleton and Gokani pleaded guilty to separate health and safety charges.
Carole Keogh, Mrs Keogh's daughter-in-law, said the family was "absolutely livid".
She said: "If Mum had got the right care at the right time, this would never have happened...it was an accident waiting to happen."
Judge Robert Brown said when sentencing Mr Gokani: "The barrier was there to prevent a resident falling into the open stairwell, as well as giving them some added balance.
"By your plea to count one, you have accepted you were responsible, to a significant degree, of causing the death of this lady."
The family, who were praised for their conduct throughout the proceedings, said the fines were "too light" and "justice had not been served".
Gokani admitted failing to ensure the wooden banisters at the home were safe contrary to the 1974 Health and Safety Act.
Appleton pleaded guilty to not having appropriate measures in place to transfer Mrs Keogh in the home and failing to have proper risk assessments.
