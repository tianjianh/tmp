[SN]TITLE[SN]
Patients 'should avoid' Royal Lancaster Infirmary A&E; unless 'life-threatening' situation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staff at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary have asked people to avoid going to its Accident & Emergency unit unless there is a life-threatening situation due to a "significant surge" in demand.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Chief operating officer Foluke Ajayi said patients were likely to experience "long waiting times" because of "increased pressure" on the department.
Those who need urgent treatment will always be prioritised, she added.
Those less seriously ill, however, "could be better treated elsewhere".
She said: "We do occasionally experience sudden increases in attendance which can impact on the time for patients to be seen, treated and either discharged or admitted."
