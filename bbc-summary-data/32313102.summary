The 19-year-old Manchester City loanee scored in emphatic wins over Dundee United and Aberdeen.
Celtic defeated United twice more to win the League Cup and advance to the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup.
Denayer, who recently won his first cap for Belgium, joined Celtic in August and has scored five times in 22 games.
It had already been announced that Ross County midfielder Raffaele de Vita had been voted player of the month for all four divisions.
County's Jim McIntyre was named Premiership manager of the month, Hearts' Robbie Neilson won the Championship award, while Forfar Athletic's Dick Campbell was top boss in League One and East Stirlingshire's Craig Tully got most votes in League Two.
The SPFL's monthly awards are held in conjunction with the Scottish Football Writers' Association, with winners voted for by members of the Scottish media.
