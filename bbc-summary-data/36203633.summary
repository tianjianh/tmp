A junior doctors leader has called for colleagues to unseat an MP who said trainees were "privileged" and "holding the NHS to ransom".

Dr Johann Malawana tweeted following the Facebook comment by Telford MP Lucy Allan on national strikes by junior doctors over pay and conditions.
"A doctor should challenge her for the seat," he tweeted of the next election.
Ms Allan said she would welcome a doctor as a parliamentary candidate to support vibrant and healthy democracy.
She said: "Every person who stands for election, be it for Parliament or parish council, offers something different which can only be a good thing for all of us as voters."

Ms Allan wrote on Facebook on Saturday: "My hard working residents in Telford don't get why... privileged trainee doctors, on course to earn Â£100,000 plus, would hold our NHS to ransom..."
Dr Malawana is chairman of the junior doctors committee for the British Medical Association (BMA) a trade union and professional association for doctors and medical students.
He said: "Lucy Allan's comments are totally misinformed.
"Instead of taking aim at junior doctors on social media, she should take the time to speak with them to understand the very genuine concerns they have about the impact of this contract on patient care in the long term."
A Facebook page called "Junior Doctors of Telford" was set up with the aim of accepting Ms Allen's offer to hear their views.
Members of the group believe Ms Allan is confusing terminology between "junior" and "trainee" doctors.
The MP said she had been contacted by two trainee doctors from her constituency, she had suggested dates for a meeting and awaited their reply.
Ms Allan said she did not have many trainee doctors in Telford but it was her job to represent their concerns.
