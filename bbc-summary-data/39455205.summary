The English league champions beat Danish side Fortuna Hjorring on Thursday to progress to the last four in their debut European campaign.
French side Lyon have reached the final five times in the past seven seasons.
"We're ready for it. We need it because we were undefeated last year in our league," Cushing told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Now we need to see where we are at, where our mentality is at and where our game is at, against the best. They [Lyon] are the best team.
"There is no pressure on us. Everyone expects Lyon to beat us. We'll enjoy putting ourselves up against the best, because we think we are a good team."
Cushing's side won the English Women's Super League One title in September, finishing their league campaign without defeat, and added the WSL Continental Cup (League Cup) in October.
So far in their maiden Champions League campaign, City have knocked out Russian side Zvezda 2005 plus Danish sides Brondby and Fortuna.
"It is an unbelievable achievement in our first season to get to the semi-finals," added Cushing. "We now can draw on all of those good performances and try to play Lyon.
"We need to enjoy putting ourselves up against what people believe is Europe's best team."
City will be at home in the first leg on the weekend of 22-23 April, before the return leg in France on the weekend of 29-30 April.
The other semi-final sees Barcelona, who beat Swedish side Rosengard on Wednesday, face 2015 runners-up Paris St-Germain, who were 4-1 aggregate winners over Bayern Munich in the last eight.
Like City, Barcelona have reached the semi-finals for the first time in their history.
