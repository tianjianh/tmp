Wheelchair rugby: Played indoors on a regulation-size basketball court, wheelchair rugby features mixed teams of men and women playing matches of four eight-minute quarters. Contact between wheelchairs forms an integral part of the game, although making physical contact with an opponent leads to penalisation.

Wheelchair tennis: Wheelchair tennis is broadly similar to the running game with a few important differences, including players being allowed to bounce the ball twice. Gordon Reid, the inaugural Wimbledon men's singles champion, will be aiming for a medal in the singles as well as the doubles with team-mate Alfie Hewett, who he shared the doubles title with at SW19 in July.
