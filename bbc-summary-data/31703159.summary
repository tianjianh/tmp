On Friday, Poundland claimed it had been advised to remove food from its Corporation Street store because of nearby "road works".
But the council's environmental health team said it had received complaints of mice and, after a visit, concluded there was an "imminent risk".
Poundland said it had followed advice.
In a statement, it said: "All food is now back on sale and the prohibition notice has been lifted. The company's primary concern is for the health and well-being of its customers and it reacted swiftly to resolve the situation."
In a previous statement, released on Friday, the firm said: "Poundland has removed food from display at its Corporation Street store in Birmingham following advice from the local environmental office.
"This advice relates to issues caused primarily by the extensive building and road works in the area."
Birmingham City Council said food went back on sale in the store on Monday.
