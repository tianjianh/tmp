One-Day Cup: Kent seal comfortable victory against Gloucestershire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent eased their way to victory in the One-Day Cup as reigning champions Gloucestershire struggled with the bat at Canterbury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gloucestershire lost Phil Mustard and Ian Cockbain early on as they slumped to 29-2 from six overs and were on the back foot as they made a below-par 200.
Kent seized the initiative with Joe Denly and Daniel Bell-Drummond's 92-run opening stand putting them in control.
Denly hit eight fours and one six as Kent won by seven wickets on 203-3.
Darren Stevens hit a six to help the hosts over the line to reach 7,000 career one-day runs thanks to his 28.
Mustard joined Gloucestershire on loan from Durham on Tuesday, but will be ineligible to play against his parent club if the two sides meet in the knockout stages of the One-Day Cup, as is the case when they face each other in the T20 Blast quarter-finals on 10 August.
