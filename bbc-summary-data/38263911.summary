[SN]TITLE[SN]
Governors at Isles of Scilly school to resign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The entire board of governors at the only school on the Isles of Scilly is to resign.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Five Islands school received an "inadequate" Ofsted rating last month and was placed in special measures.
The governors have now written a letter to all parents saying they will be stepping down.
They are unhappy with an action plan drawn up by the school in conjunction with the Council of the Isles of Scilly, after the Ofsted report.

The school serves all children from age three to 16 on the five populated Isles of Scilly.
The letter written by Ben Julian, chair of the governors, calls for an interim executive board to be set up by the local authority, saying: "All members of the current governing body give notice that they will resign their posts immediately on formation of the interim executive board."
Ofsted inspected the school over two days in September and found particular issues in leadership and management.
The Council of the Isles of Scilly said in a statement: "It is anticipated that the interim board will be in place with effect from 1 January 2017.
"The local authority wishes to thank the outgoing governors of the Five islands School for their efforts over the relatively turbulent period of the last few years."
