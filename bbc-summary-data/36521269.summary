The biggest local authority in England has announced it will work with a charity to bring in graduates to its troubled children's services.

Birmingham City Council will join up with Frontline to train up new workers.
Last month it was announced the council's children's services will be taken over by a trust after not enough improvements were made following a string of scandals.
About 60 people will be based across the West Midlands.
Alastair Gibbons, executive director of children's services for the council, said the plans show the authority is "committed to improving our support for children".
"Frontline will provide high quality development for aspiring social workers and leaders who want to make a difference to those in need in the city and region," he said.
Josh MacAlister, chief executive of Frontline, which began training and recruiting people to work with vulnerable children in 2013, said applications for the roles are set to open later in the year.
He said: "Social work has the power to change lives and, alongside existing professionals in the region, we're looking forward to developing more outstanding social workers to help address deep social disadvantage."
