Anglesey killer red squirrel virus 'highly infectious'

Scientists have identified a deadly disease in red squirrels on Anglesey - and it has spread to animals on the Gwynedd mainland.

Tests were carried out after a cluster of dead red squirrels was discovered in woodlands near Beaumaris.
Experts have now confirmed the mammals had tested positive for adenovirus.
Dr Craig Shuttleworth of Bangor University said the virus could be "highly infectious" and "pretty devastating" to infected squirrels.
"We have an unfortunate first. We've found it in Gwynedd for the first time in an animal that was found dead near Bangor," he added.
Dr Shuttleworth said the disease could be carried by other animals, such as wood mice, who may be passing it to the red squirrel population.
"Some animals carry it and don't show any symptoms and it may not affect them, but they spread it to other animals who then die from it," he explained.
But he said the disease tended to by found in isolated clusters.
"We're hopeful it won't spread particularly widely and affect everywhere."
The red squirrel population on Anglesey has increased from about 40 squirrels in 1998 to more than 700 and a wild colony is set to be established in neighbouring Gwynedd to try and boost its numbers.
