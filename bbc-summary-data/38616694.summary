The 20-year-old, who started her career at Manchester United's Centre of Excellence, joined Everton in 2013.
"This was the perfect move for me, I needed a fresh start and this will be the perfect place for me to develop," she told Bristol City's club website.
The Vixens were promoted back to the English top flight in 2016.
Manager Willie Kirk added: "Millie's arrival is going to create good competition for places and I imagine she will be a prominent member of the team."
