[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scots began the final day of the four-day match needing 149 runs to win.
But Grant Bradburn's side could only add 156 runs from 64.2 overs in their second innings, having amassed 133 in their first.
The Dutch posted 210 and 123 runs in their innings and Peter Borren took four wickets. Richie Berrington top-scored for Scotland with 59 runs.
Preston Mommsen and Berrington were undefeated on 18 and 16, respectively, at the end of day three.
But Mommsen could not add to his tally as he was caught by Borren off a delivery by Roelof van der Merwe.
Berrington and Rob Taylor (52) breached the half-century mark for Scotland but Matt Cross's four runs was all the Scots could muster from their last four batsmen.
Michael Rippon had top-scored for the Dutch in their second innings with 37.
