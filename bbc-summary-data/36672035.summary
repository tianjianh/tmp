The 28 year-old suffered the injury during the club's League Two play-off semi-final tie with Plymouth in May.
Pompey manager Paul Cook has confirmed Evans will not feature in the season opener against Carlisle on 6 August.
"Gareth's a tough lad, who will be back as strong as ever come late August or September," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
Evans made 32 league appearances for Pompey last season after joining on a free transfer from Fleetwood in the summer.
