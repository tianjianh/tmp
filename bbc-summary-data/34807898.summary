Number of Northern Ireland health service managers on more than £100,000 doubles

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Figures from the Department of Health show the number of managers earning £100,000 and over has almost doubled in the last three years.

The information was contained in a written answer to Ulster Unionist MLA Jo-Anne Dobson.
Fifteen non-medical staff earned between £100,000 and £124,999 in 2012/13, while in 2014/15 30 staff fell into that bracket.
There is little change in the number of managers earning £125,000 and over.
The figures also show that 980 doctors in Northern Ireland earn between £100,000 and £124,999.
A further 445 earned more than that.
"The publication of these figures shines a light on what is happening at the top echelons of the local health service," Ms Dobson said.
"I am outraged that whilst key staff and patients are being forced into ever intolerable conditions, so many public sector workers and administrators at the top are being remunerated over £100,000 per annum."
On Thursday, former chief medical officer of England, Sir Liam Donaldson, welcomed the health minister's proposal to close down the Health and Social Care Board.
He said it needed to happen quickly and he would expect to see a cut management costs.
