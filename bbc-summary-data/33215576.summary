The Last Night of the Proms event, which is now in its 14th year, will bring together artists from Northern Ireland and around the world.
They will be performing alongside the Ulster Orchestra in a programme that combines classical and contemporary music, as well as a few surprises.
Almost 11,000 free tickets will be allocated in a random draw after the 15 July closing date for applications.
Outside of the Royal Albert Hall, Last Night of the Proms events will also take place on the same night in Glasgow, Swansea and London's Hyde Park.
BBC Proms in the Park in Northern Ireland will be hosted by Noel Thompson and Claire McCollum.
It will be broadcast live on BBC Radio Ulster and streamed online. Highlights programmes will be recorded for both BBC NI and BBC Four for later transmission.
Peter Johnston, BBC Northern Ireland director, said: "This is one of the most ambitious outside broadcasts and events we undertake each year, with demand for tickets always exceeding supply.
"BBC audiences at the event and those watching and listening at home can expect a very special evening - showcasing local and international talent and celebrating the very best in music-making."
The event is being supported by Belfast City Council.
Deputy Lord Mayor Alderman Guy Spence said it promised to be "another memorable occasion".
"Its setting with the wonderful backdrop of Titanic Belfast allows us to showcase our city as the 'must see' cultural and tourism destination we all know it to be," he said.
