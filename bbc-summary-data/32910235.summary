Fifa congress opens as sponsor concerns grow over arrests

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Football's governing body Fifa is due to open its annual congress despite warnings from sponsors that they may review ties over the arrest of senior officials on corruption charges.

Coca-Cola, Adidas and Visa were among the companies to voice their concern.
The European football body Uefa will decide whether to boycott Friday's vote for the next Fifa president.
Seven top Fifa officials were arrested in Zurich on Wednesday, among a group of 14 people indicted.
Fifa on Wednesday announced a provisional ban from football-related activity on 11 of the people involved in the US prosecution.
But it said the election on Friday - in which Fifa president Sepp Blatter is seeking a fifth term - would go ahead.
Commenting a day after the arrests, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told the BBC there was "something deeply wrong at the heart of Fifa and international football needs to reform, needs to get its act together".
Mr Blatter, who has not been named in the investigations, issued a statement on the US case, saying: "Such misconduct has no place in football and we will ensure that those who engage in it are put out of the game."
He is due to make his first appearance since the arrests at Fifa's annual congress in the Swiss city of Zurich on Thursday.
Swiss prosecutors have also opened a separate investigation into the bidding process for the World Cup tournaments in 2018 in Russia and 2022 in Qatar.
Fifa's key sponsors have faced increasing calls to put pressure on Fifa as corruption allegations have mounted.
Fifa's main sponsors are afforded exposure in stadiums and have the right to use Fifa trademarks in advertising.
Mr Blatter also received a stinging rebuke from Uefa, which said the events were "a disaster for Fifa and tarnish the image of football as a whole".
It said corruption was deeply rooted in Fifa's culture.
The European body said Friday's congress risked becoming a "farce" and that the vote should be postponed.

The USA may be a footballing minnow but today it has shown the importance of fair play with the breathtaking news conference given by the attorney general, the head of the FBI and the head of the IRS.
The scale of what they allege is eye popping - the kickbacks, the fraud, the money laundering, the extortion, the corruption, the bribes.
Al Capone is made to look like a kindergarten novice compared to this lot, if the allegations turn out to be true. The IRS boss said "this is the World Cup of fraud and today we are giving Fifa a red card".
Drama football fans could do without
Those indicted in the US case are accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (Â£97m) over a 24-year period beginning in 1991.
Spelling out details of the US case, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said some Fifa executives had "used their positions to solicit bribes. They did this over and over, year after year, tournament after tournament".
FBI director James Comey said: "The defendants fostered a culture of corruption and greed that created an uneven playing field for the biggest sport in the world."
The seven arrested in Zurich were vice-presidents Jeffrey Webb and Eugenio Figueredo; Eduardo Li, Julio Rocha, Costas Takkas, Rafael Esquivel and Jose Maria Marin. They face extradition requests from the US.
The seven were subject to the new Fifa ban, along with Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Chuck Blazer and Daryll Warner.
Jack Warner, a former Fifa vice-president, turned himself into police in his home nation of Trinidad and Tobago late on Wednesday evening. Mr Warner is accused of soliciting $10m in bribes from South Africa's government over the hosting of the 2010 World Cup.
Mr Warner, who spent the night in prison after delays in processing his $395,000 bail, says he is innocent of any charges.
Mr Leoz, 86, is in hospital suffering from flu, his lawyer Fernando Barriocanal said, adding that the Paraguayan was surprised by the charges and ready to defend himself.
Ms Lynch said the charges included:
In the second case, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings "against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups".
Swiss police said they would question 10 Fifa executive committee members who participated in the votes that selected Russia and Qatar in December 2010.
