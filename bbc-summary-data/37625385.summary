[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kenneth Owen, 71, from Lincolnshire, had worked at the council-run Wisteria Lodge in Coventry in the 1980s.
He and colleague Alan Todd were jailed in February for a "regime of terror" and "grotesque" abuse, a judge said.
The Prison Service said Owen died in hospital last Wednesday. His death was not suspicious, there will be an independent investigation.
Owen, from Boston, was serving a term of four years and four months at Oakwood Prison near Wolverhampton after being found guilty of five cruelty charges at Warwick .
An inquiry into the historical abuse at the home is being conducted by Coventry City Council's Safeguarding Children Board.
It will look at why complaints about the home, which has been knocked down, were not acted upon for many years.
