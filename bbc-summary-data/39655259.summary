Police forces in England and Wales are increasingly being used as the "first resort" for dealing with people who have mental health problems, a watchdog has warned.

In his annual review on policing, he said the "inadequacy" of mental health provision should "disturb everyone".

There were almost 240,000 incidents in England and Northern Ireland last year in which mental health issues were handled by police, figures released earlier this year suggest.
In total, UK police forces dealt with nearly 300,000 incidents involving people with mental health problems last year, the figures suggest.
