England v Netherlands: Tottenham's Michel Vorm in squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tottenham keeper Michel Vorm and midfielder Marco van Ginkel, on loan from Chelsea to PSV Eindhoven, have been added to the Netherlands squad for Tuesday's friendly against England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vorm, who has made one Premier League appearance this season, is in for Ajax's Jasper Cillessen (broken nose).
Van Ginkel last played for the Dutch in August 2013 and is a straight swap for injured Ajax captain Davy Klaassen.
Wesley Sneijder pulled out of the squad on Saturday with a hamstring injury.
The Galatasaray midfielder captained the Dutch in their 3-2 defeat by France on Friday but picked up the injury in the first half.
Tuesday's game against England, who beat Germany 3-2 in Berlin on Saturday, kicks-off at 20:00 BST at Wembley.
