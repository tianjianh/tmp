Ched Evans: Investigation into rape conviction begins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquiry into the rape conviction of Welsh footballer Ched Evans has begun by the body that examines potential miscarriages of justice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Evans was found guilty in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, the previous May.
The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) said in October it would fast-track its inquiry, but said it was not policy to reveal why.
The investigation could take 35 weeks.
The former Sheffield United player was released from prison in October after serving half of a five-year sentence.
A CCRC spokesman said: "The case has not been prioritised because Mr Evans is relatively famous, because he plays football for a living, or for any reason external to the specific facts of the case.
"Prioritisation like this is not typical but it is by no means unprecedented.
"We prioritise applications where there is need and where it accords with our policy to do so, we expect to prioritise perhaps one or two such cases each month."
