[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gloucestershire v Durham: Chris Dent's century defies Durham at Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Relegated Durham ate into their massive pre-season 48-point penalty with the lion's share of the spoils from a draw with Gloucestershire at Nevil Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But they were denied any hope of victory by a spirited Gloucestershire resistance led by centurion Chris Dent.
Resuming on 68 out of 175-3, with only a 59-run lead, Dent hit 101 to help Gloucestershire reach 320.
Keaton Jennings then made an unbeaten 30 as Durham got to 85-4 from 23 overs before hands were shaken.
Durham are now 37 points behind second-bottom Leicestershire, who have lost two of their first three matches, on top of their own pre-season 16-point deduction.
Gloucestershire opener Dent, who made 160 in the match, has now passed fifty four times in his first six innings this season in first-class cricket.
