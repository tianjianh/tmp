[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A group campaigning for a train line linking Aberystwyth and Carmarthen has flown its proposed route to take aerial shots.

Traws Link Cymru said the flight showed the "vast majority" of the 56-mile (90km) track bed was unaffected by development.
The line, which stopped at more than 20 stations, closed in 1965. The group is hoping for a 90-minute service between the two towns.
Reinstatement would cost about Â£650m.
Nigel Bird from Traws Link Cymru said: "Almost three hours of footage was recorded, from three cameras mounted on or in the plane.
"When edited this should provide a useful record when the full feasibility study is approved, hopefully later this year."
The drive between the two towns takes about 90 minutes, but a train journey would take six hours or more travelling via Shrewsbury, Newport and Cardiff.
