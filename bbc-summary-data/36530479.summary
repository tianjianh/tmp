With Surrey needing 11 to win off the final over, paceman Berg (4-64) took the wickets of Tom Curran and Gareth Batty as Surrey finished on 283-9.
Ben Foakes and Zafar Ansari's 130-run stand had earlier got Surrey back into the match with them struggling on 72-4.
Tom Alsop (116) was the pick of the home batsmen - his maiden List A ton in his fourth match helping them to 289-8.
Sean Ervine added 50 for his second half-century in successive One-Day Cup matches, following his 53 in the defeat by Gloucestershire on Tuesday.
In response, two of Surrey's top four fell for a combined three runs, before Foakes (72) and Ansari (62) put together a partnership that lasted 23.2 overs.
But, despite them falling within 13 balls of each other, brothers Tom and Sam Curran shared 55, before the latter was caught by Mason Crane in the 48th over off the bowling of Berg for 42.
After the visitors could only manage five runs off Tino Best's next over, Berg dismissed Tom Curran (25) and Batty in two balls as the hosts ended the day two points above Surrey in the South Group in sixth.
