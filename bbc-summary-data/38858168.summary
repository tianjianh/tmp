Webb, 33, was appointed O's manager on Sunday after Andy Edwards resigned to take a youth coaching job with England.
Former Arsenal trainee Riza, 37, and sports scientist Amoah will now work alongside the former Southend striker.
"From the outside it looks like a very inexperienced staff, but they know how I work," Webb told BBC Radio London.
"The players are buying into training and what we are trying to get across to them."
Orient are 23rd in the League Two table, one point from safety, but with a game in hand on four of the five sides above them.
Webb takes charge of his first game on Saturday, when Carlisle are the visitors to the Matchroom Stadium.
"If we can keep them in the Football League it will be a good achievement for everyone," Webb added.
"Regardless of the poor results and where we are in the table we have some good players, some good fans and a good stadium. We shouldn't be written off yet."
