Total Fitness in Wrexham will become the first centre in Wales to offer the Swim Stars programme, which Adlington started to help more children swim.
There are currently 21 Swim Stars swim schools in the UK and more than 3,500 children have been enrolled.
Adlington will be attending the launch on Saturday.
"Even though I retired from competitive swimming just over two years ago, I am still passionate about swimming and committed to helping more kids learn to swim," she said.
