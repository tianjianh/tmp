Lucien Favre: Nice 'will not respond favourably' if Dortmund make approach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nice "will not respond favourably" if Borussia Dortmund make an approach for their Swiss boss Lucien Favre, the Ligue 1 club says.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dortmund are seeking a replacement for Thomas Tuchel, who has left the German club after two years in charge.
Favre, 59, steered Nice to a third-placed finish in 2016-17 - his first season in charge of the French club.
"It's logical that a coach of his calibre would attract the biggest European clubs," said a Nice statement.
"However, given the proximity to the return to training [19 June], the club will not respond favourably to any negotiation for their manager, under contract until June 2019.
"This decision is firm and without any doubt.
"It has been clearly communicated to Borussia and, of course, also to Lucien Favre, who perfectly understood and accepted the decision."
