Brentford defender Egan and Reading midfielder Kelly are in the 39-man provisional squad with Newcastle keeper Rob Elliott, who returns after a year.

The Irish host Wales on 24 March before a 28 March friendly with Iceland.
The extended panel for the two Aviva Stadium games was announced on Monday by Republic boss Martin O'Neill.
Everton midfielder James McCarthy is an injury doubt after suffering a recurrence of a hamstring injury.
Elliot returns to the squad for the first time since being injured against Slovakia in March last year.
The visit of Wales will be the Republic's fifth qualifying game following victories over Georgia, Moldova and Austria, as well as a draw away to Serbia.
