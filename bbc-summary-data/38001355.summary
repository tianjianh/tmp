An Army officer has appeared at a court martial charged with rape.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lt Col Benedict Tomkins, of Defence, Equipment and Support, based at Abbey Wood, near Bristol, is due to stand trial in March next year.
The 48-year-old spoke only to confirm his name, rank and unit, during the hearing at Portsmouth Naval Base.
Judge Advocate Gen Jeff Blackett told the hearing that part of the trial would be held in the USA, to enable witnesses to give evidence.
The trial is then expected to continue in Bulford, Wiltshire.
The judge adjourned proceedings for a further preliminary hearing to be held on a date to be set in the new year.
