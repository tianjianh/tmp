It is the first time fallen snow has been seen on the ground in Tokyo in November since records started to be taken in 1875.
The snow, caused by an unusual cold front over the city, caused slight delays on public transport
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also warned of possible icy roads, snow on electric wires and trees, and the collapse of plastic greenhouses, according to the Japan Times.
