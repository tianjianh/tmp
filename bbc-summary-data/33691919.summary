[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A funeral has taken place of a victim of the Tunisia beach attack who shielded his wife from the gunman.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Mellor was among 30 Britons killed in Sousse on 26 June.
The 59-year-old from Bodmin, Cornwall, was on holiday with his wife, Cheryl, when he was killed by Seifeddine Rezgui, a Tunisian student with links to Islamic State extremists.
Mrs Mellor, who lost a hand and suffered gunshot wounds, said Mr Mellor was killed trying to protect her.
She said in a tribute read by the vicar that he was her "soul mate" and would love him forever.
Mr Mellor was killed when Seifeddine Rezgui, a Tunisian student with links to Islamic State extremists, opened fire on the beach last month.
His coffin was led into St Petroc's Church to an accompaniment of Funeral For A Friend sung by Elton John.
An inquest into the killing has been opened and adjourned in London.
The Reverend Graham Minors said before the funeral: "Cheryl loved him dearly and that will be the theme today, about love of family and the love they had together."
