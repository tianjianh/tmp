Conservative MP Justin Tomlinson has written to the Metropolitan Police after the publication of a photo online by the Guido Fawkes website.
Mr Tomlinson told the BBC that road safety was an important issue and the matter should be investigated.
Mr Khan, the Labour MP for Tooting, is a former transport minister.
The MP, who is thought likely to seek the Labour nomination for London mayor in 2016, was given a national award by road safety charity Brake this year.
Mr Khan told the BBC: "Allegations have been made that I glanced at my phone whilst in my car.
"I understand that a Conservative MP has now reported this matter to the Metropolitan police.  Of course I will be fully cooperating with any investigation."
Mr Tomlinson has written to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe about the alleged incident, reported to have taken place on Monday.
"I would be very grateful if you could investigate this further - road safety is a serious issue and those who make the laws should certainly not be above them," he wrote.
The Met confirmed it had received Mr Tomlinson's complaint.
A spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that today we have received a letter. We are currently assessing its content."
