TV coverage showed hundreds of empty seats at Leicester City's third-round replay against Spurs, with many home fans missing the start of the game.
One supporter claimed the delays at the King Power Stadium, caused by ticketing problems, could have "turned nasty".
Leicester City FC has apologised and launched an investigation.

Joe Walker, a Foxes fan, said he arrived at the ground at about 19:25 GMT and saw "thousands of people attempting to gain access".
He said after 20 minutes in the queue his "print at home" ticket was rejected at the turnstile and he was told to go to the ticket office to get a new one.
"We then walked towards the sub ticket office and as I questioned another steward he just laughed and said: 'You should see the queues for it'."
Mr Walker eventually had a ticket printed at the main office, but described the way staff managed the situation as "a shambles".
"Not one announcement had been made over the loudspeaker system," he said.
"There was no organization or information coming from any of the stewards. It could have easily have turned quite nasty with the sheer amount of people."
Leicester City FC said: "A significant number of supporters experienced difficulty gaining admission to the stadium, resulting in many missing the start of the match.
"The club is currently investigating the cause of Wednesday night's delays as a priority, to ensure any difficulties experienced are not repeated at future home matches."
Leicester lost Wednesday night's match 0-2.
