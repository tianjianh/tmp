Edwards, 23, has not fought over 12 rounds before, while his Philippine opponent has had 10 world title fights.
Casimero, 26, is a former light-flyweight world champion.
"It's come sooner than I expected but I am going to grab this opportunity with both hands," said Edwards, a former European amateur bronze medallist.
"I won the European Schoolboys when I was 14 and I signed with GB [Boxing] when I was 15, one of the youngest they've had.
"I've been all over the world boxing in different countries, against all sorts of styles, and won lots of medals.
"I've done my apprenticeship and that's why I am confident. This isn't too soon for me because of my amateur pedigree.
"The way I box, I'll be shocked if he can keep up with my movement. I'm a classy boxer. It's not going to be a close decision, it will be a wide win."
In May, Casimero avenged a loss against Thailand's Amnat Ruenroeng to land the IBF flyweight belt he first boxed for in 2011.
Edwards' clash with Casimero is on the undercard of the eagerly anticipated match-up between Kell Brook and Gennady Golovkin at London's O2 arena.
Also on the bill, Lee Haskins defends his IBF bantamweight title against fellow Briton Stuart Hall.
Martin J Ward and Andy Townend meet for the vacant British super-featherweight title, while Callum Smith defends his WBC 'silver' title against Hungarian Norbert Nemesapati.
