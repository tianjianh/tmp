Kinde, 36, was the last of the 10 refugee athletes to compete in Rio, coming 90th in the men's marathon on Sunday.
The team of swimmers, judokas and runners competed under the flag of the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
IOC president Thomas Bach said the athletes were selected to "send a message of hope to all the refugees of the world".
"We are equal now," said Kinde, who is originally from Ethiopia. "We compete like human beings, like the others.
"We are 10 refugees selected by the IOC and their flag leads us. Sixty-five million follow us, more than one country. We are inspiring them."
Here are the athletes of the Refugee Olympic Team, their stories and how they got on in Rio.
Who is he? The 25-year-old fled war-torn Syria in 2015, travelling by boat across the Mediterranean Sea to Turkey before continuing to Belgium.
