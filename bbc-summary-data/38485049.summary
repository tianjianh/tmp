Murder investigation after Milngavie house fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police officers have started a murder investigation after the death of a man in a house fire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The victim's body was found in the badly-damaged house by emergency services personnel.
They had been called to Achray Place in Milngavie at about 07:25 on New Year's Day.
A 24-year-old woman was seriously injured in the fire and was taken to Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for treatment.
Two other people, a man and woman who are both 54, have been treated for smoke inhalation.
Police and fire service investigators later established the fire was started deliberately.
Det Insp Martin Fergus said: "This is a truly terrible incident in which a man has died and another woman remains in a serious condition at hospital following a targeted and wilful fire.
"Local residents are understandably shocked that a man has lost his life within the blaze, particularly given that it occurred on New Year's Day, a time when families and friends come together and spend time with one another.
"I want to reassure local residents that all is being done to trace the person or persons responsible, and to ensure that they are held to account for their actions."
He added: "It is possible that local residents who were jogging, or walking their dogs, between 0700 hours and 0730 hours, are yet to speak with officers. It is also possible that passing motorists may have witnessed anything which may help our investigation.
"You may have seen someone running away from the house at this time, or perhaps seen someone acting suspiciously in the area. As part of our broader investigation, any information could prove critical in tracing the person or persons responsible for this horrifying crime."
