Adrian Evans, a council worker from Tipton, his father, who had worked as a general manager at Newby Foundries for 33 years, and teenage nephew, from Wednesbury, had just arrived in Tunisia when they were killed.

A joint funeral for Janet and John Stocker, from Morden, Surrey, will take place at Putney Vale Crematorium in south-west London.
