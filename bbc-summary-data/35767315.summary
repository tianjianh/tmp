The #rideforolivia tribute was launched following the death of Australian Olivia Inglis, 17, in a fall on Sunday.
Hundreds of thousands of social media users from dozens of countries have been posting and sharing photos of their own horses using the hashtag.
Olympic gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin is among the high-profile figures to have joined in the tributes.
Fellow British dressage rider and gold medallist Carl Hester has also paid tribute.
The movement echoes a similar social campaign to mark the death of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes in 2014.
The hashtags #putoutyourbats and #putyourbatsout were tweeted and shared across platforms such as Instagram and Facebook along with photos of cricket bats.
As of 08:00GMT on Thursday, more than 120,000 people had posted photographs and videos for #rideforolivia on Instagram alone.
The images will be used to create a mosaic of Olivia for her family, following a call from the bloodstock company which her family runs.
"We have been overwhelmed by the kindness and sympathy from family and friends throughout the school, equestrian and thoroughbred communities," parents Arthur and Charlotte said in a family statement.
