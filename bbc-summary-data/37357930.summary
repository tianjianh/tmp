The tie seemed to be heading for extra time before the France midfielder struck in the 96th minute.
Payet, who started on the bench, lashed the ball over the wall to beat QPR keeper Elliot Parish.
West Ham, who finished with 10 men after Arthur Masuaku went off injured, will host Chelsea in the fourth round.
Slaven Bilic's side have lost four of their opening five games in the Premier League and have suffered back-to-back 4-2 defeats.
The West Ham manager made seven changes to the side that lost at West Brom on Saturday, handing debuts to Alvaro Arbeloa and Edimilson Fernandes.
But the Hammers struggled to create any meaningful chances against the visitors and there were boos at half-time before Payet came on to inspire a vital victory.
West Ham boss Slaven Bilic:
"We expected an easier win, with the greatest respect, and not to have to do it in the last minute.
"We went down to 10 men but we wanted to score before extra time and then, a great moment from a great player. We didn't play good but I thought we deserved to win."
Accrington Stanley manager John Coleman said:
"People will throw bouquets at us for our spirit today but we don't want to be seen as plucky. We came here to win and we matched them for most of the game. Unfortunately we've gone to sleep in the 96th minute and you give a player of Payet's quality a free-kick on the edge of the box and it's tantamount to a penalty.
"We talked about putting a man on the line but that makes it difficult for the goalkeeper. You've got to applaud the quality. But he earns more in a month than our whole squad earns in a season. Because he can do that. And we can't."
