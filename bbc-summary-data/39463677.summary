[SN]TITLE[SN]
Crawley Town 1-2 Plymouth Argyle

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ryan Taylor scored a dramatic stoppage-time winner as promotion-chasing Plymouth came from behind to clinch a 2-1 victory at 10-man Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taylor gave Argyle their 13th away win with a close-range shot after a Graham Carey penalty had earlier cancelled out a Dean Cox opener for the hosts.
Crawley, with six defeats in their previous eight home games, shook their high-flying opponents in the 28th minute when former Brighton and Leyton Orient winger Cox scored his first goal for the club.
Cox forced the ball past goalkeeper Luke McCormick from close range after a good move which involved Billy Clifford, Enzio Boldewijn and Lewis Young.
Boldewijn had gone close early on by heading over an Andre Blackman cross at the far post.
Cox tried his luck shortly before the interval when his goal-bound shot from a pass by James Collins was saved by McCormick.
Top scorer Carey put an angled shot over but Plymouth struggled for fluency in a disappointing first half.
Crawley marksman Collins was off target shortly after the break when he headed a Cox cross over.
Plymouth drew level on 63 minutes when Mark Connolly fouled Antoni Sarcevic on the edge of the area and Carey slotted his 14th goal of the season to the right of Glenn Morris.
Argyle substitute Paul-Arnold Garita should have done better when he fired over when well placed after a pass from Craig Tanner.
Crawley were reduced to 10 men 11 minutes before full-time when Collins was shown a second yellow card in a challenge with Yann Songo'o.
And Taylor made Collins pay when he fired in deep into stoppage time to leave Plymouth 12 points clear of fourth place with only five games left.
