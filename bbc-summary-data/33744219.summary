Stuart Beavon's second-half strike gave Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's side the lead as he reacted quickest to a loose ball.
The Iron then had goalkeeper Luke Daniels sent off after he appeared to strike Mark Duffy, with Lucas Akins converting the resulting penalty.
Substitute Charlie Goode headed an injury-time consolation goal for the visitors from Gary McSheffrey's corner.
Burton manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told BBC Radio Derby:

"Scunthorpe are a good side. It was always going to be an afternoon where you have to defend well and at times we did.
"I must say in the first half we had the two best chances. They had some chances - they hit the woodwork, but that's just what it is.
"We looked good at times and at the end I think we looked the stronger team. In the last five minutes I thought we had another gear."
Scunthorpe manager Mark Robins told BBC Radio Humberside:

"First and foremost we came here against a strong, physical Burton Albion side with momentum.
"We've come off the back of a really good pre-season and you'd expect better from us.
"I expect better from us, the players expect better from each other and we took a little bit of time to get some confidence."
