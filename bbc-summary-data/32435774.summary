[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen fan fined for IRA comment to Celtic fans

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen fan who admitted inciting public disorder by making a remark about the IRA to Celtic fans on Remembrance Sunday has been fined.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Fraser, 24, made the comment last November at Pittodrie Stadium.
Fraser admitted the offence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Alison Stirling refused the Crown's call for a banning order preventing him going to future fixtures and instead fined him Â£300.
The sheriff said a ban from football matches would be "disproportionate" given that Fraser had no previous history of getting into football-related trouble.
She said:  "I regard this case as at the lower end of disorder."
Celtic - who were down to 10 men - won the game 2-1 thanks to a late goal, after Aberdeen had taken the lead.
