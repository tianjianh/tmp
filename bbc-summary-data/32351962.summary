The developers behind a planned £2bn Paramount theme park are holding a series of consultation events.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Exhibitions will be held across the Kent boroughs of Dartford and Gravesham at 10 locations in April and May.
London Paramount said this fourth round of consultation would help the project team to hear the views of the public before plans went to the government.
More than 50 companies on the Swanscombe Peninsula have said they fear compulsory purchase orders (CPO).
The developers have said the entertainment resort will bring up to 27,000 jobs to the area and more than 50 rides and attractions based on film and TV programmes.
Key features include a water park, a creative commercial hub, up to 5,000 hotel rooms, improvements to transport infrastructure, an events space, service buildings and staff training facilities.
Exhibitions to be held from 29 April to 14 May will include an emerging masterplan, a range of proposed transport options, and a scaled model of the resort.
Plans will be submitted to the government later this year.
