Waiting times at emergency departments across Wales worsened last month, figures have shown.

More than 81% of patients were seen within four hours during November.
The Welsh government's target is for 95% of patients to be admitted, transferred or discharged within that time.
Figures released on Thursday showed 81.4% of patients were seen within four hours last month - down from 83.7% in October and 84% in September.
A campaign launched in Wales in October urged patients not to clog up A&E with minor injuries.
The Welsh government said almost a million people were seen in emergency departments every year.
A spokesman said: "The most recent statistics available show half of all people attending an emergency department in Wales were admitted or discharged within just over two hours of arrival."
