Crewe Alexandra: Jonny Margetts loan spell from Scunthorpe falls through

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe have cancelled a loan deal for Scunthorpe's Jonny Margetts because he has already played for two clubs this season, BBC Radio Stoke reports.

The 23-year-old striker was one of two players brought in by the Alex on deadline day, along with Callum Cooke.
But he has appeared for Scunthorpe and previous club Lincoln during the current campaign.
Defender Bondz N'Gala's proposed move from Eastleigh to Gillingham fell apart on Thursday for similar reasons.
Crewe are 19th in League Two, just four points clear of the relegation places ahead of Saturday's trip to Exeter.
