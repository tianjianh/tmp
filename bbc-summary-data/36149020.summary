[SN]TITLE[SN]
One pint warning issued to drivers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A sheriff has warned motorists that one drink can put them over the legal limit in Scotland after issuing driving bans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It followed two cases at Dumfries Sheriff Court where both drivers involved claimed they had consumed just one pint.
Sheriff Scott Pattison fined them Â£450 each and banned them from driving for a year.
"That's the lesson in Scotland," he told them. "Just one drink can put you over, it's as tight as that."
Donald McCallie, 66, of Annan, admitted driving in nearby Summergate Road on 19 April with a reading of 35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath.  Since December 2014 the legal limit has been 22 micrograms.
His solicitor Liz Dougan said McCallie had had one pint of cider and if he had been just 10 miles down the road in England he would not have been committing an offence.
The legal limit in England is 35 micrograms.
Ashley Medicks, 62, of Kirkgunzeon, also pleaded guilty to driving in High Street, Dalbeattie, on 21 April with a reading of 32, also over the 22 microgram limit.
He too stressed that he had had just one pint.
However, the sheriff fined both men and banned them from the road.
