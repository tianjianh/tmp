[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oil on Gorleston beach from '1978 tanker'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oil that has washed up on a beach in Norfolk is thought to have come from a tanker which sank almost 40 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It appeared on Saturday and has washed ashore along about a mile of the coast between Gorleston and Hopton.
The Eleni V sank off the coast of Norfolk in 1978 after being blown up by the army, losing more than 5,000 tonnes of fuel.
Great Yarmouth Borough Council leader Graham Plant said the oil is believed to have leaked from the Eleni V.
Mr Plant said: "What has happened is the oil is getting to the shoreline, but the rest of the beach and the promenade is fine. It is a legacy of the Elena V."
He said council staff would be going down to the beach on Monday to assess any clean-up operation needed.
The Greek-registered ship got into difficulties and then capsized after colliding with the bulk carrier Roseline off the Norfolk coast in May 1978.
Army experts blew up the ship a month later.
