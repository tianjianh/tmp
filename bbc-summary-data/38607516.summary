[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A suspected paedophile who went on the run and became one of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been arrested in France after crashing his car.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Carruthers, 43, from Bury, was wanted by Cumbria Police in connection with 18 offences of making indecent photographs of a child.
He was missing for three years and was living in France under a false name, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
His capture was "a huge slice of luck" they added.
Mr Carruthers was found after he was admitted to Cahors Hospital with minor injuries following a car crash on Saturday.
He was kept in for observations where checks by the French authorities revealed his real identity.
After officers executed a European Arrest Warrant at the hospital, Mr Carruthers appeared before the general prosecutor of the appeal court of Agen where he was remanded in custody.
Matt Burton, head of the NCA's International Crime Bureau, said: "The majority of our most wanted fugitives are captured as a result of intelligence-led operations, but with Mr Carruthers his days on the run ended thanks to a huge slice of luck.
"He will be returned to the UK to face justice."
Mr Carruthers was originally arrested in March 2014 at an address in Ambleside. A computer recovered was found to contain 5,332 indecent images of children.
After being interviewed he was given bail to re-attend the police station but failed to return.
Mr Carruthers was among 10 British fugitives named as the most wanted by the NCA as part of their Operation Captura.
