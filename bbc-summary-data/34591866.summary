[SN]TITLE[SN]
Outrage and bemusement over Wales Bill

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watching the debate about the draft Wales Bill in the Senedd, the sense of outrage which many AMs clearly felt about the proposed legislation peaked when a number of them spoke about how they believed it reversed the result of the referendum on law making powers in 2011.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leading the charge was the first minister of course who, as one commentator put it to me, was in the zone, talking about the possibility of a constitutional crisis and an English veto on Welsh laws.
I'll wait for the dust to settle on the bill before commenting on the substance of whether Carwyn Jones is right to talk in such dismissive terms about it.
In a corridor conversation I had with him he said his officials were facing a mountain of work to try to overcome difficulties.
It appears to be hugely complex.
If the constitutional expert from Cardiff University, Richard Wyn Jones, says there's a world of pain ahead in terms of the tensions between Westminster and Cardiff Bay then I'll take him at his word.
For the moment, let me focus on the politics.
The Conservatives appear at times to be bemused by the subject of constitutional reform.
At best, they accuse Labour and Plaid of being out of touch on the issue, and at worst they accuse the first minister of using it as a giant smokescreen to hide failures on the delivery of public services
Now on one level they are right about the public appeal.
Most people will look at you as if you have two heads if you ask them whether they care about the issue of reserved powers.
Although I suspect if you frame the question in a different way, say to a traditional Labour voter for example, about whether they want decisions made in Wales by a Labour administration or by Tory ministers in Westminster then they may engage with you.
And this is where we get into the politics of the matter.
I think it's clear that Carwyn Jones is protesting loudly about the draft Wales Bill because for genuine reasons, but as we approach the assembly election, he may not feel it harms his electoral chances to be perceived as someone who stands up for Wales.
On the flip side, the more he does it the more the Conservatives feel it helps them portray the Welsh Labour leader as a man who doesn't engage on the issues that really matter to people.
I should say there's still much in the bill that politicians in Cardiff and Westminster agree on, such as devolving powers over consent for large energy projects and assembly elections, but barely a word of that was mentioned in the debate.
Constitutional reform is a tough sell all round it seems.
