The Indian Ocean islanders join Senegal, Equatorial Guinea and Sudan in Group A of 2019 qualifying with their first fixture set to take place in Khartoum in June.
North African-based Madagascans scored the goals that gave their home fans a rare chance to celebrate an important victory.
Egypt-based Paulin Voavy (pictured) bagged a brace within 17 minutes of the kick-off and Carolus Andriamahitsinoro from Algerian club USMA scored on 80 minutes.
Ferreria Soares and Adilson Varela scored for Sao Tome e Principe.
On Tuesday, Mauritius and South Sudan have home advantage as they seek to overcome two-goal deficits against the Comoros and Djibouti respectively.
