The Arts Council England (ACE) list also included a rare 16th Century manuscript and a Victorian vase designed by William Burges.
They were purchased by institutions after the government enforced an export ban, giving them time to raise funds.
ACE chief executive Darren Henley said saving them was of "huge public value".
If an object is more than 50 years old and requires a licence for export out of the UK, the Reviewing Committee on the Export of Art and Objects of Cultural Interest, managed by ACE, can decide whether the object is of national importance.
Its latest report said between 2014 and 2015, 12 items were referred to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, with five being subsequently purchased for collections across the UK by institutions.

"This underlines both the continuing need for strong support and for trying to ensure that we make practical improvements to our processes where we can."
