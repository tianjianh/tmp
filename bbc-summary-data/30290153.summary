Nintendo may be closer to putting Game Boy titles on smartphones.

The Japanese company has updated patents to make games like Street Fighter II, Super Mario Land and Donkey Kong available on phones, tablets and the back of plane seats.
It covers what's called a software emulator, which would "emulate a handheld video game platform".
The patent (a legal document stopping rivals copying your ideas) includes all titles playable on the Game Boy.
The technology is aimed at a "low-capability target platform (e.g., a seat-back display for airline or train use, a personal digital assistant, a cell phone) and uses a number of features and optimizations to provide high quality graphics and sound that nearly duplicates the game playing experience on the native platform."
Nintendo released a series of drawings in 2000 describing how it would all work, which were updated in 2003 and again 2012.
However, don't expect anything soon.
Nintendo said in January that it would not be releasing its games on smartphones in the near future.
The firm's president Satoru Iwata said he was committed to video game consoles despite disappointing sales of the Wii U.
"Lots of people have said we should go onto smartphones over the last few years, telling us our business would increase. But our approach is not to put our games on smartphones," he said.
He did say that the company would license character rights to other firms and that mobiles had a place in helping customers "understand the wonder of Nintendo games".
