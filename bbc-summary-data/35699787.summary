Past fixtures have seen anti-Semitic behaviour by Hammers fans.
Spurs fans traditionally have strong ties with London's Jewish community.
"Any fan acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be banned from attending future matches," Sullivan and Gold said in a statement.
"It is vitally important that every West Ham United supporter attending the fixture remembers that they are acting as ambassadors for our club and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards that we set," the statement continued.
Gold is of Jewish heritage, and has previously revealed that his great grandfather killed himself after suffering anti-Semitic taunts.
West Ham are currently sixth in the Premier League table, while Spurs are second.
