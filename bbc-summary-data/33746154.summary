The 21-year-old was found dead in his hotel room on 19 July, less than 24 hours after arriving on the island.
The funeral for Mr Drennan has taken place at St Dorothea's Parish Church in Gilnahirk, east Belfast.
Mr Drennan, a mechanic and doorman, had gone to Ibiza on holiday with 10 friends.
The circumstances of the Newtownabbey man's death are unclear, but friends claim he was beaten by police after an incident on the flight to the Mediterranean island.
A second post-mortem examination took place in Dublin on Wednesday.
In his funeral address, the Reverend Nigel Kirkpatrick told the mourners: "It is hard to imagine that just two weeks ago today, Alan was getting ready to set off on holiday with his friends and here we are today in the same church where he was baptised, saying our farewells and wondering about the nature of it all.
"I have listened to the very lovely tributes made in this service, and one thing speaks very clearly to me - Alan wasn't finished with life.
"He had done so much and been through a fair bit in this life, but he still had much more to do. He had plans and ambitions; he had energy and vitality and a great love for life."
He added: "We're here to celebrate the goodness and love Alan showed in his life. We're not here to say he was perfect, none of us are. Only God is perfect.
"But just as a little pond in the woods reflects some of the glory of the sky and brings down to earth a little bit of heaven for all to see, so a life full of love brings down to earth a little bit of heaven for all to see."
