Young, 28, won the final race of the regatta to beat the USA's Paige Railey by a single point.
It is a first world title for Portland's Young, whose previous best performance was fourth in 2012.
"I've sailed pretty consistently," said Young. "It's a great confidence boost [ahead of the Olympics], but there's still plenty of room for improvement."
Young, who finished fifth at London 2012, has already been selected for this summer's Games.
