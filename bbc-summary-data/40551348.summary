Heather Knight's side beat defending champions Australia by three runs in a thrilling World Cup group-stage match at Bristol on Sunday.
Almost 5,000 fans were at The County Ground, and Perry said: "The support is incredible.
"They're doing a great thing for cricket and we love coming over here and playing."
England, who lost their opening match in the competition to India, inflicted a first defeat of the tournament on Australia.
It means the sides occupy first and second in the group table respectively, with the top four qualifying for the semi-finals.
Perry, who is the world's second highest-ranked ODI all-rounder behind England's Sarah Taylor, added: "The standard of skill between both teams was incredible with bat, ball and in the field.
"I think a lot of the time the crowd really is a part of that by lifting the players.
"Everyone wants to be involved in this type of game."
England's next match is against fourth-placed New Zealand in Derby on Wednesday, before they face struggling West Indies at Bristol in their final group game on Saturday.
Australia are still to face key rivals for a semi-final place in India - who also sit on eight points - and South Africa, who are a point behind.
