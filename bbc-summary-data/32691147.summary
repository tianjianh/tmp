They've won more than 100 big awards over the last 20 years for their shows and their presenting.
But what's the story of their success?
It all began when Ant and Dec met on the set of CBBC show, Byker Grove, when they were just 13 years old.
Their characters, PJ and Duncan, were mates in the show and Ant and Dec soon became friends in real life.
From acting to singing - in 1993 the series led to the guys signing a record contract and over the course of four years they had 14 top 20 hits.
And from singing to presenting - in 1996 they got a taste of Bafta glory when the Ant and Dec Show, which used to be on the BBC, won an award.
In 1998 they launched SM:TV Live and CD:UK, mixing music, comedy and cartoons. The show was co-hosted with Cat Deeley - a British presenter who now hosts So You Think You Can Dance in America.
The pair have hosted lots of other programmes and game shows over the years and among the many awards they've won, they've picked up 14 at the National Television Awards in the category of most popular entertainment presenter. They won it for the first time in 2001 and have kept winning every year since!
Among the well-known shows they present are I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here, which they've hosted since it started in 2002, and Britain's Got Talent, which launched in 2007.
