Andy Carroll and Slaven Bilic: West Ham duo avoid Football Association action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
West Ham boss Slaven Bilic and striker Andy Carroll will not be charged by the Football Association over their comments about referee Jon Moss.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bilic has been "reminded of his responsibilities" and Carroll "warned as to his future conduct" after the duo criticised Moss following the 2-2 draw with Leicester City on 17 April.
Carroll said Moss tried to "even things up" with the award of a late penalty.
Bilic suggested the referee had been "influenced" by the home crowd.

Moss sent off Leicester striker Jamie Vardy for diving when his side led 1-0, before awarding West Ham a controversial penalty, which Carroll converted to equalise.
The visitors then took the lead, before Moss gave Leicester an injury-time penalty for Carroll's nudge on Jeffrey Schlupp, which substitute Leonardo Ulloa converted to rescue a point.

"People say he shouldn't be influenced [by the crowd], but this is real life," Bilic told Match of the Day after the game.
