Heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury has been fined and banned after admitting driving at 90mph in southern Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He had previously admitted the charge by letter at Dumfries Justice of the Peace Court but failed to turn up after being ordered to appear personally.
That led to a warrant being issued for his arrest and a weekend in police custody.
He received a two-month driving ban and Â£400 fine for the offence committed near Carrutherstown in November.
His father and manager, John Fury, told the court he took the blame for his son's failure to appear on two previous occasions.
"There had been a change of address and, as his manager, I am responsible for dealing with matters like that and hadn't picked up his mail," he said.
When the case was originally called, Fury, whose address at that time was given as being in Heysham, sent in a letter admitting driving at 90mph on the A75 near Carrutherstown, between Dumfries and Annan.
He also admitted failing to comply with a solid white line marking.
The court had ordered his personal appearance because of the possibility of a disqualification..
His father pointed out that his address was now in Lancaster and, as his son sat in the dock, added: "He needs his driving licence because of the amount of travelling he has to do."
However, Justice John Bickett indicated that there were already 11 points on Fury's licence and banned and fined him.
As he left the court the boxer said he had been arrested on Friday night and spent the weekend in custody.
He said: "I have now experienced what it's like for a criminal â€¦ at the expense of the government."
