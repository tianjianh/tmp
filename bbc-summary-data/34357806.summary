Lord Advocate calls for Crown Office health and safety power

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Lord Advocate wants the Crown Office to be given statutory powers to lead investigations into health and safety failings.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frank Mulholland QC said giving the prosecution service the powers - which it already holds for Police Scotland and Sepa - would lead to more efficient investigation of cases.
It would encompass the HSE, and the marine and air accident investigation branches.
He was speaking in Aberdeen.
The Lord Advocate said: "Our cases are more complex than ever before. That has been the case for some time and is the reason that the Crown moved to set up the specialist Health and Safety Division within Crown Office.
"The division has held a conviction rate of 98% for the cases it has taken up.
"This shows that our expertise in this area has contributed in helping to create a safer workplace for people in Scotland.
"We are, however, not complacent and we will continue to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our work to help make Scotland a safer place."
He added: "It is vital that good health and safety practice is embedded across the public, private and third sector.
"We do not want to have to deal with the consequences of health and safety failures. It is better they don't happen in the first place."
A UK government spokesman said: "The all-party Smith Commission Agreement recommend a review of the functions and operations of the Health and Safety Executive in Scotland whilst also recommending the legislative framework should remain reserved across the whole of the UK.
"On that basis we will continue to work with the Scottish government and the Health and Safety Executive to create a safer workplace for people in Scotland."
