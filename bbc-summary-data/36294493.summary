The 20-year-old follows the late Peter Heatley, who claimed 10m bronze in Budapest in 1954.
"I've no idea how I've managed it," Reid told BBC Sport.
Matty Lee and Georgia Ward took mixed 10m synchro silver, taking Britain's European medal tally to nine.
The pair won team bronze on the opening night of competition, while Ward secured individual 10m bronze on Friday.
"I don't think all of the success this week has really hit me, but it is just amazing," Ward told BBC Sport.
Lee added: "It's a bit of a fun event for us, as the focus is on our individual competitions, but it's a massive confidence boost when we do so well."
Reid also won gold in the non-Olympic mixed synchronised 3m springboard final alongside Tom Daley on Thursday.

Her rate of improvement over the past 12 months has been astounding and she is now a serious contender for the Rio 2016 Olympic team.
Last year synchronised pair Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg were seen as the leading candidates for individual places.
However, Reid stepped up to secure Team GB a berth in the event for this summer's Olympics via the Rio test event in February.
Gallantree was in third heading into the final round of the 3m final in London, but was overhauled by Reid's stunning final routine.
"I've put in so much hard work behind the scenes over the last 12 months, doing weights at 6:30am three times a week and doing university," she said.
"It's a nice life balance, though, and my diving is really taking off now."
The final day of competition on Sunday features Commonwealth champions Gallantree and Blagg in the synchronised 3m springboard final.
Daley will be looking for his third medal of the competition in the individual 10m platform event, which will also feature Lee.
