Unemployment in Northern Ireland fell by 400 in July, according to the latest government figures.

The number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits now stands at 43,500.
It reverses June's increase in the number of jobless - which had been the first jump in 28 months.
However, Northern Ireland's unemployment rate of 6.5%, remains above the UK average.
The figures also show that long-term unemployment continues to be a problem in Northern Ireland.
Northern Ireland's rate of 59% is well above the UK average of 31%, while youth unemployment is also higher.
Enterprise Minister Jonathan Bell welcomed the fall in unemployment claimants, but said the levels are back to where they were a year ago.
"The latest figures reiterate the continued challenges faced by the Northern Ireland labour market and the impact of continued uncertainty in global markets," he said.
"The Northern Ireland unemployment rate [6.5%] is above that for the UK [5.6%], however, it continues to compare favourably to the April 2015 rates for the European Union [9.6%] and the Republic of Ireland [9.8%].
"In the face of these challenges it is important local businesses continue to seek new foreign investment and export opportunities."
