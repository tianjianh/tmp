Sri Lanka v India: Ravindra Jadeja stars as tourists complete series win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India completed a series win over Sri Lanka with a crushing victory by an innings and 53 runs in the second Test in Colombo.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane both hit centuries as India posted 622-9 declared in their first innings.
Sri Lanka were never in the game once they were bowled out for 183 in reply.
They managed 386 in their second innings - Dimuth Karunaratne making 141 - but India's spinners sealed victory on the fourth afternoon.
Ravindra Jadeja picked up the man-of-the-match award after hitting an unbeaten 70 off 85 balls at number nine before taking 2-84 and 5-152 with the ball.
India won the first Test in Galle by 304 runs. The third and final Test gets under way in Pallekele on 12 August.
Jadeja will miss that match after he was suspended for a breach of the International Cricket Council's disciplinary code.
The all-rounder pleaded guilty to the charge, which related to throwing the ball "in a dangerous manner" towards Karunaratne as he fielded off his own bowling on day three.
He lost 50% of his match fee and earned three demerit points, taking him to a total of six in the past two years, leading to a one-game ban.
