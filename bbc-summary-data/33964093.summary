"We all headed down to the street, and you could smell the cordite. You knew that a bomb had gone off," he said.
"I managed to get a first aid kit from the office. As we got closer there were lots of bodies, one person had been cut in half.
"I went into the shrine. I saw at least nine people, unfortunately, who looked like they had died.
"I tried to administer CPR to one particular guy who was in his 40s. His family were with him. He didn't make it.
"There were lots of people with horrific injuries. Scenes of distress and total shock."
"We were on the Skywalk which runs right near the shrine. We were directly above the area when the explosion went off," she said.
"The impact was so strong it sucked us forward and then pushed us back. We saw flames go up in the air, followed by shrapnel.
"As we left the area the scene was very graphic. We saw people lying on the road, some crawling away, some without limbs.
"Our heads are sore from the impact. A nurse from our hotel checked us out but we will try to go to hospital later."
"There was total chaos. They blocked off the area, everyone was running in totally different directions," he told the BBC.
"About five minutes later police and ambulances rushed to the scene. I counted around 20 ambulances.
"That area is usually very, very crowded as it's in the middle of the city and it's usually very packed.
"A local hotel is full of injured patients. I saw a family that was bleeding badly."
"I was driving home and I was about 50m from the intersection. At that point there was a loud bang," he said.
"It sounded as if lightning had struck, but I looked up and I saw no clouds.
"After some time I could hear sirens and saw smoke. I rolled down my window and could smell burnt rubber.
"There were lots of police and ambulances and I could see fire in the background. It was a big shock."

"Our hotel is very, very close to where the bomb went off. We heard a bang and went down to reception, where we were told not to leave.
"We followed that advice - but an hour or two later we nipped outside. The scene was cordoned off and emergency people were still there.
"I'd describe the scene as chaotic," she said.
"We visited the shrine on Saturday. It's the most central in Bangkok and hugely popular.
"Up until now I've felt very safe. We were only supposed to be staying in Bangkok for two days but extended our stay because we loved it so much.
"We were just so lucky we stayed in the hotel for an afternoon nap rather than going outside."
"There's a skywalk above the main commercial district where people can walk between the Skytrain station.
"There was debris that had blown up there and the police had shut down that area, probably about 20 minutes after the blast had happened.
"There were three motorcycles at the intersection and there was a real acrid smell in the air.
"Over the course of the next hour it was pretty chaotic."
