Groove Loch Ness saw several acts including Eli & Fur, B Traits, Tensnake and 2 Many DJs play to a crowd of about 4,500 people at Dores over the weekend.
A spokesman for the event said the organisers would be meeting later this week to discuss its future.
Groove Armada closed the festival which ran from Saturday until 02:00 on Sunday.
The spokesman added: "We are delighted with the response to the first Groove festival.
"The audience were fantastic, all of the DJ's played incredible sets and we of course had the most incredible festival setting in the world.
"The Groove team are going to regroup this week once everything has sunk in, so watch this space and information on Groove's next chapter will be revealed soon."
The festival near Inverness was organised in just eight months by four people working in the music industry in Scotland.
Caroline Campbell is director of the Ironworks venue in Inverness, while Dougie Brown, Sam Barker and Joe Gibbs are involved in the running of the Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival near Beauly. Mr Gibbs was a co-founder of RockNess.
Police estimated about 4,500 festival-goers attended the event, which they said passed without significant incident.
Officers carried out 31 positive drugs searches over the course of the day and dealt with only one report of minor disorder.
