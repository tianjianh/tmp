Resorts World Birmingham: How does it compare?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Persuading the public to spend their holiday in a 12-storey building on the edge of the M42 may seem like a tough task for the people behind Resorts World in Birmingham.

Roughly based on the shape of a cruise ship, the behemoth is situated at the NEC complex on the outskirts of the city - officially part of Solihull and an area few people would have on their mini-break hot list.
So how will it compare to other resort destinations?
Nestled within the sprawling NEC, Resorts World is not in a glamorous spot.
It is bordered by the M42 motorway, Birmingham Airport and the large housing estate of Chelmsley Wood. But does that matter?
The Genting Group is not aiming for guests at the resort to have a local experience.
With an Asian-themed spa, Australasian-themed restaurant and New York-themed bar, Birmingham - or even the UK - does not intrude.
The idea, which has proved popular in Malaysia and the Philippines, is that once through the doors of Resorts World, visitors could be anywhere. Or nowhere.
The business behind Resorts World, Malaysian conglomerate the Genting Group, already owns and runs more than 40 casinos in the UK - as well as casino resorts in the Philippines, Bahamas, New York, Singapore and Malaysia.
The International Casino in Birmingham will have more than 100 slot machines, as well as roulette, poker, blackjack and baccarat.
The 100-seat sports bar, with large multi-screens and "luxurious private viewing booths" facilitates live match play, and with no windows for daylight to remind gamblers how time is passing, it is open 24 hours a day.
Resorts World respects gender difference. Away from the sports bar and its rampant masculinity, there is a drinks menu for those of us without a Y chromosome: "For the ladies we offer an extensive list of tantalising cocktails, why not try our Genting Spring Punch or the Hurricane Rita?"
It may be smaller and arguably less glamorous than Las Vegas - but once inside, a casino is a casino.
The Genting Hotel promises its rooms "offer a self-contained sanctuary to make you feel right at home". Facilities include a Smart TV, coffee machine, ironing board and a bed.
Like the world-famous Bellagio casino and hotel in Las Vegas, Resorts World Birmingham enjoys a waterfront location.
There may not be a spectacular fountain display, but guests in Birmingham can opt for one of the five-star suites, "complete with panoramic lakeside views".
An Asian-themed spa is due to open in the next few months, with a private entrance "away from the eyes of the public" for hotel guests, so they can come down from their rooms wearing dressing gowns without being exposed to the stares of shoppers and gamblers.
The ground floor of Resorts World Birmingham houses more than 50 shops - all of them outlet stores. Deliberately less aspirational than the high-end retailers of Bicester Shopping Village, Resorts World offers an eclectic mix.
Yves Delorme ("a passion for luxury home linens since 1845") is just round the corner from Hallmark's discounted greetings card shop.
Fitness fanatics can check out Nike's outlet store before popping to nearby Holland and Barrett for health food - unless cut-price chocolate at Thornton's proves too tempting.
And should you wish to "fragrance your special event", Farringdon and Forbes sells "luxurious home fragrances and accessories".
There are 18 bars and restaurants to keep people fed and watered.
On the rooftop the Sky Bar is designed around a "theatrical centrepiece teriyaki and yakitori grill, where food is freshly prepared for you while you enjoy signature cocktails inspired by Wu Xing, the five elements of Asian philosophy".
Visitors can "embrace the thrill" of the Robata Charcoal Grill, which offers "an inspiring fusion of western European, Australasian and Pan Pacific cuisine".
Opposite the Genting Arena gig venue, the World Bar tempts with imported wines and beers that span the globe.
Genting hopes that by offering everything under one roof, the resort itself is the destination.
If the company is right, the centre of England might just end up the centre of the holiday world.
