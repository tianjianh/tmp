The years which followed saw protracted conflicts culminating in independence for Algeria and most other French colonies in Africa as well as decolonisation in south-east Asia.
France was one of the founding fathers of European integration as the continent sought to rebuild after the devastation of the Second World War.

President: Francois Hollande
Francois Hollande beat the conservative incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, in May 2012 to become France's first Socialist president since Francois Mitterrand held the post from 1981 to 1995.
Despite coming from his party's moderate win, Mr Hollande campaigned on strongly left-wing proposals, including a 75% top income tax rate, 60,000 new teachers, and the renegotiation of the European Union fiscal growth pact.
His Socialists went on to win a comfortable majority in the June 2012 parliamentary elections.
Prime minister: Bernard Cazeneuve
Bernard Cazeneuve became prime minister in December 2016 when his predecessor, Manuel Valls, quit to pursue a bid to secure the Socialist nomination for the presidency.
In his previous job as interior minister Mr Cazeneuve had to deal with a series of jihadist attacks which were unprecedented in France.
France enjoys a free press and has more than 100 daily newspapers. Most of them are in private hands and are not linked to political parties.
Public broadcaster Radio France targets the domestic audience, French overseas territories and foreign audiences. Radio France Internationale is one of the world's leading international stations. Its Arabic-language Monte Carlo International service broadcasts across the Middle East.
Global news channel France 24 TV broadcasts in French, English and Arabic. It has said it aims to present "a different point of view from the Anglo-Saxon world".
