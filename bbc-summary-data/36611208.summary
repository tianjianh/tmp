Dozens of jobs at the Southampton office of cruise company Carnival are at risk over plans to set up a new ship management company in Germany.

The move is part of proposals to bring Carnival's European and Asian brands together, including P&O and Cunard.
The firm said the move would affect 50 members of staff.
But one staff member told the BBC hundreds of jobs could be at risk when back office, ship management and IT jobs are moved to Hamburg in September.
The staff member, who asked to remain anonymous, said: "The only [jobs] we can see surviving are the phone centres, but we just don't know."
Staff in Southampton are so worried about their future they they have leaked internal documents to the BBC.
In a Q&A memo about Project Doppler, Carnival UK admits "the perception is that there will be job losses."
It does not say how many. But one member of staff told me hundreds are at risk.
Carnival UK denies it. But the documents show the creation of a new company in Hamburg is a substantial long term strategic move.
A Carnival spokeswoman said: "There are over 1,000 people employed in Carnival House. The creation of the new maritime operation will affect approximately 50 of these people."
Internal documents seen by the BBC suggest "Project Doppler" will combine the technical teams and ship management for the Cunard, P&O Cruises, Aida, Costa and Fathom brands under one roof.
