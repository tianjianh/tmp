The unseeded 44-year-old was pushed hard by Sherrock, the sixth seed from Milton Keynes, but eventually prevailed to win her second Lakeside crown.
Ashton, from Bolton, took the first set and snatched the second after Sherrock missed a series of chances at doubles.
The youngster regrouped to win the third but Ashton clinched victory in the fourth.
She dropped just two sets on her way to the title, during a run that saw her knock out top seed Deta Hedman and nine-time world champion Trina Gulliver.
"I'm over the moon," Ashton told BBC Sport. "I've been really pleased with my form this week and I can't ask for any better."
Sherrock, the youngest player to reach a BDO world final, can be proud of her achievements during her second World Championship appearance, hitting six 180s in her first final.
"I've really enjoyed it," she said. "I've got this far so I'm pretty sure I can win it in the future."
