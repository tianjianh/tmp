[SN]TITLE[SN]
Malcolm Porter jailed for indecent images charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who offered to pay boys to send him indecent images of themselves has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malcolm Porter 24, admitted 15 offences including attempting to cause a boy, 13, to engage in sexual activity.
Police found hundreds of images, including 294 in the most serious category, at his home in Carlisle, where he was a university student in 2015.
Porter, of Burnside, Eddleston, near Peebles, was jailed for 28 months.
The youngest child he had a picture of was one year old, Carlisle Crown Court heard.
Porter also admitted nine counts of making an indecent photograph of a child and five illegal image distribution charges.
Some of his criminal conduct was said to have occurred while he ran a business photographing cycling competitors.
Porter contacted boys in their early teens engaging them in "disgusting and perverted discussions" about sexual activity, the court was told.
Porter must sign the sex offenders' register for 10 years and abide by the terms of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order.
