More than a hundred climate change protesters have held a "die-in" demonstration at Heathrow Airport against plans for airport expansion.

Campaigners from Reclaim the Power wore masks and carried posters as they lay down at Terminal 2 in west London.
The protest comes as the government is set to decide in the next few weeks whether to expand Heathrow or Gatwick.
Cyclists dressed in red also rode to Harmondsworth Detention Centre as part of the protest to highlight migration.
A "picnic" demonstration was also held at Gatwick airport earlier in the day as part of the series of activities by climate change campaigners.
The events coincide with protests against airport expansion across the world as the International Civil Aviation Organisation hold a conference addressing the impact of aviation.
The activists wanted to highlight how communities were affected by climate change and the link between climate change and migration.
Mary Adams from Reclaim the Power, said: "Expanding airports is completely irresponsible and will bring us out of reach of our own targets to stop climate change.
"Expanding Heathrow is incompatible with creating a fairer and more equal world."
The hour-long demonstration at Heathrow went off peacefully and the airport said there were no disruptions.
