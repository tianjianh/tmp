[SN]TITLE[SN]
Claudia Lawrence case: Charges against four men considered

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prosecutors are to consider whether to bring charges against four men arrested on suspicion of the murder of missing chef Claudia Lawrence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She disappeared after leaving her house on Heworth Road, York, on her way to work in March 2009.
The men, all aged in their 50s and from the York area, were arrested in March and April.
Police said the men had been released from bail whilst the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) considers the case.
Officers said a file of evidence was being prepared for the CPS but it would "take some time", as would any assessment of the file.
Ms Lawrence was 35 when she disappeared. Her body has never been found.
Det Supt Dai Malyn asked that members of the public and the media do not identify the men.
A review of the case was undertaken in October 2013 but to date no-one has been charged in connection with Ms Lawrence's disappearance.
