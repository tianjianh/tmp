The 53-year-old had just locked up HQ Prime Meats, in Smethwick, in the West Midlands, when the men appeared and beat him in the street.
They tried to make him reopen the premises before taking some jewellery from him and escaping in an Audi A3.
The victim suffered a badly broken leg which required emergency surgery, West Midlands Police said.
He remains in a severe but stable condition in hospital following the attack in Fawdry Street on 8 January.
The suspects fled towards Cranford Way, the spokesman added.
Anyone with information is urged to call police.
