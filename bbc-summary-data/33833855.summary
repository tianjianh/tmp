Jordan Blackburn fell ill following "substance abuse" at Kendal Calling on 31 July. His friend Christian Pay died.
The group of friends are believed to have taken at least three different types of tablet at the event.
Mr Blackburn, 19, has shared the photo online to highlight the "devastating" impact of taking unknown substances.
His mother, Alison Turnbull, said he wanted to stop other people making his mistake.
She said: "I thought my world was about to end, I really did. I knew about Christian and I just thought, 'this is it', I just thought we'd lost him.
"He just wants to raise awareness. He was laying in his hospital bed and he just looked and he said, 'I've been given a second chance at life, haven't I?' and I said, 'yes you have'.
"Physically he's fine. He's still really tired; his body has been through quite a trauma. Mentally he's coping OK, but I think he's got what I would term as survivor's guilt."
Mr Blackburn, from Haverigg, Cumbria, spent three nights in the Cumberland Infirmary.
Mr Pay, 18, of Millom, was pronounced dead at hospital. He was described by his family as a "fun guy" with "enough personality for everyone".
In total 14 people were treated in hospital after falling ill at the event.
Cumbria Police said four people arrested on suspicion of possession of drugs with intent to supply were on bail.
