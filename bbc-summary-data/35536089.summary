[SN]TITLE[SN]
Super League: Castleford Tigers 40-6 Wakefield Wildcats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Castleford Tigers ran in seven unanswered tries against Wakefield to record their first Super League win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stuart Howarth opened the scoring for Wakefield before Denny Solomona, Ben Roberts and Luke Dorn tries put the hosts 18-6 up at the break.
Oliver Holmes went over with Tigers' first attack of the second half.
Further Solomona, Holmes and an Adam Milner try completed the resounding win for the hosts.
The Tigers shared the spoils with Hull KR in their season opener last week, but there was no sign that Wakefield would be given the chance to fight their way back into the contest as Rovers were.
Howarth gave the Wildcats the ideal start with the games' first points, but that was the first and last time they led as Solomina's try was converted by Luke Cale to lock scores up after six minutes.
Roberts then went in to edge the hosts ahead, with Dorn then dummying brilliantly to cross for Castleford's third try.
Holmes quickly added to the advantage after the break, with Milner touching down before Solomona completed his brace.
Junior Moors fended off a series of tacklers and dished the ball off for Holmes to complet the win and consign Wakefield to a second defeat this season.
