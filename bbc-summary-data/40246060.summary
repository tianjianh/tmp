Poldark returns, but without Ross's bare torso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If you were starting to feel withdrawal symptoms from not seeing Ross Poldark and the sweeping Cornish coastline, you were rewarded on Sunday with the return of the BBC One drama.

The series kicked off with a birth, two deaths and a marriage - and the introduction of three new characters including Demelza's two brothers, Drake and Sam.
But what most viewers were disappointed to see, was the lack of bare torso from Poldark himself which helped make Aidan Turner famous.
Even critics were quick to point it out in their reviews.
Others hoped Demelza's genetically blessed brothers might fill the hole Poldark's covered chest has left behind.
Despite torso-watch, everyone agreed it was a welcome return to screens as the summer TV schedule gets under way.
Viewers were also keen to share their views on Twitter - here are some of our favourites.
You can read all the reviews in full in The Guardian, The Telegraph, Daily Mail, Digital Spy and Independent.
