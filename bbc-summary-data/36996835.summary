Hibernian have turned down an offer of Â£1.2m up front from League One side Peterborough United for Jason Cummings.

The fee would have increased with add-ons and a potential sell-on clause, but the Scottish Championship club are determined to keep the striker.
Cummings, Hibs' top scorer last season with 25 goals, recently signed a new four-year contract.
And the Easter Road outfit see the 21-year-old as an integral part of their promotion challenge.
He has been part of the first team since the 2013-14 season, which ended in relegation from the top flight.
BBC Scotland has learned Hibs would not welcome any further approach from Peterborough.
"You can see why he's making the headlines, but he's our player and it'll remain that was for the foreseeable future," said Hibernian manager Neil Lennon following the 2-1 win over Falkirk.
"He's a great kid, and he's worked really hard on his fitness and I think you can see that. He could have had three or four without being disrespectful to Falkirk.
"Everyone has a price, but I would doubt a lot of clubs could match what we think of Jason at the minute."
