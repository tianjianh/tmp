Obituary: Jennifer Nicholson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There was never any doubt about Jennifer Nicholson's chief talent - music.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a passion that was eventually to lead her on to the Circle Line train which was targeted by a suicide bomber in the 7 July 2005 attacks.
A talented musician who played the piano and sang in choirs, Miss Nicholson, 24, was travelling to her job at a music publishing company in central London when she was killed.
The inquests heard Miss Nicholson was standing by carriage doors when the bomb detonated and was blown out of the train onto the track.
The evidence suggests she was killed instantly.
From an early age, Miss Nicholson loved the arts, especially music and literature.
"As a small child, she was rarely without a book in her hand or song on her lips," her mother, Julie, said in a statement to the inquests.
"Whether singing in a church choir, being part of a large festival chorus or raucously belting out diva-style with her sister and friends, Jenny simply loved all manner of making music.
"One of her favourite musical memories was harmonising with an ensemble of university friends as they celebrated a May Day dawn on a hill above Reading."
She had been an active member of Horfield Parish Church in Bristol, where she devoted much of her time to music and drama.
Miss Nicholson went on to study music and English at Reading University, where she pursued her love of performing, before returning to her home city of Bristol to complete a masters degree in advanced musical studies.
She settled down in Reading with her boyfriend, James, who she met during her first term at university. The couple planned to marry and have children.
When she died she was on the cusp of her career, formulating plans for the future including a PhD, her mother told the inquests.
Jennifer Vanda Nicholson was born in Bristol on 17 October 1980, the first child of Greg, and Julie Nicholson.
Her father works for BAe systems, while her mother is vicar of St Aidan's with St George church in Bristol.
"Within weeks of her birth, Jennifer had a big smile, laughing eyes and a loud chuckle, features which soon became a mark of her personality and sunny, sociable nature," her mother said.
She had a sister, Elizabeth, and brother, Thomas.
Friends recall Miss Nicholson as a much loved member of a remarkable, creative family, in which she developed close relationships.
She was travelling to work at the offices of Rhinegold Publishing, where she was an advertising sales executive, when she died.
The publisher has a portfolio of music titles such as Classical Music magazine, The Singer and Opera Now.
"Jenny was adored by all who met her and she will be missed more than words can say," John Simpson, deputy general manager at Rhinegold in 2005, said.
"From a personal point of view it has been a joy and a privilege to know such a beautiful person, both as a colleague and more importantly as a friend."
The Rt Rev Mike Hall, bishop of Bristol, said: "She was a talented, beautiful and vivacious young woman whose life was stretched out before her and we are not going to see that fulfilled."
Her mother said: "Jenny was a kind and honest person with a huge capacity for love and laughter. She had a gentle manner and always tried to see the goodness in everyone.
"She was bright in every sense of the word, hard-working, and had a bubbly zest for life which touched the lives of all who knew her."
