The anniversary marks the storming of the Bastille prison, which helped spark the French Revolution, way back in 1789.
The theme for this year's celebration was War and Peace, to commemorate 100 years since the start of World War One.
The 35-minute display included fireworks fired from the famous Eiffel Tower for the first time in 12 years.
