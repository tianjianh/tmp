Inverness-London air service suspension 'disappointing'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The leader of Highland Council has described Flybe's decision to suspend its Inverness to London service as "disappointing".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The airline announced last week that it will stop the service from 22 February because of a lack of demand.
The daily flights began in October last year.
Council leader Drew Hendry said he was concerned about the loss of the service and said the local authority was seeking a meeting with Flybe bosses.
He said: "It seems premature to come to such a conclusion after just two months, when it must still be very early days for the new service.
"It is also disappointing that Highland Council has not been consulted in the decision."
Mr Hendry added: "Inverness remains well connected to the rest of the UK with flights to Gatwick, Belfast, Bristol and Manchester, as well as our international service to Amsterdam.
"However, it is vital for the continued economic development of the Highlands that our connectivity is sustainable and continues to grow."
Flybe said last week that it was "regrettably" suspending the service to London City Airport due to lower than anticipated passenger numbers.
The airline operated a service between Inverness and Gatwick Airport before selling the slots to Easyjet in a Â£20m deal in 2013.
