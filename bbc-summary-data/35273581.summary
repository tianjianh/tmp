The first four sets went against the throw, with number eight seed Gulliver, 46, winning the decider 3-0 to clinch the Â£12,000 first prize.
"I'm absolutely delighted. It was always going to be a tough game against Deta," she told BBC Sport.
Hedman, 56, has lost in three finals at Lakeside and is yet to win the title.
Essex-based Hedman clinched the first set with a 118 finish but Gulliver, who lives in Somerset, hit back with a 133 checkout to level the match.
Both players missed two darts to win the third set before number three seed Hedman took it on double 10, but Gulliver broke back to square the contest for a second time.
Gulliver, making her 12th appearance in a World Championship final, grabbed a crucial break of throw in the second leg of the deciding set before landing double 18 for the title.
