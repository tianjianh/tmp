Det Ch Insp Wayne Jones was suspended in January, the force confirmed.
He led high-profile cases such as that of 16-year-old Christina Edkins who was stabbed on a bus in 2013, and the 2012 murder of 16-year-old Kyle Sheehan.
West Midlands Police's professional standards department is examining the allegation.
According to figures covering the past financial year - the period between April 2013 and 2014 - Det Ch Insp Jones was one of 25 police officers suspended, and one of four suspended over sexual allegations.
The other three are two constables and one special constable.
Supt Tim Godwin, from the professional standards department, said: "Each case is dealt with on an individual basis in line with national criteria, depending on the nature of the allegation and whether it is appropriate for the officer or staff member to remain at work whilst an investigation is conducted."
