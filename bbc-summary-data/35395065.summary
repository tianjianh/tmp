Flood-hit Victoria Bridge reopening delayed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The reopening of a damaged flood-hit bridge in Cumbria has been delayed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Victoria Bridge in Kendal was fully closed on 13 January after erosion was found under the bridge pillar due to continuous fast flowing water.
It was expected to re-open this week after divers worked in the River Kent to temporarily stabilise the bridge.
A Cumbria County Council spokesman said it was "really frustrating", but river levels and technical problems have delayed reopening until next weekend.
The council said when water levels allow, further work will be required in the summer to carry out work to protect the new foundation against future flooding.
