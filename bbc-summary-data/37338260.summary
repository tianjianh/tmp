The action-adventure film made $35.5m (£27m) between Friday and Sunday, according to studio estimates.
Directed by Clint Eastwood, Sully recreates the real-life 2009 'miracle on the Hudson' emergency landing.
It exceeded expectations of its first week's takings, which were around $25m (£19m), to knock the last fortnight's leader Don't Breathe into third place.
The thriller about three teenagers who burgle a house but find that its blind owner is not as helpless as he appears made $8.2m (£6m).
In second place came new opener When the Bough Breaks, which made $15m (£11m).
The erotic thriller stars Morris Chestnut and Regina Hall as a couple who hire a surrogate in a desperate bid to have a baby. However the surrogate soon shows signs of becoming a threat as she develops a psychotic fixation on the husband.
Sully sees Hanks star as Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, the pilot hailed as a hero after saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew when his plane's engines failed over the Hudson river.
The film was adapted by Eastwood from Highest Duty, Sullenberger's autobiography.
Sully also stars Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney.
Paul Dergarabedian, of box office trackers ComScore, said research showed the majority of the audience was over 35 and female, adding that Hanks was the main reason for going to see the movie.
Eastwood was also said to have been a draw for many others.
"Sully brings one of the world's most beloved stars and one of its great directors together in a true life drama that delivers the kind of gravitas and depth that defines the so-called 'Oscar season' that usually takes some time to ramp up, but this year gets right to work," Dergarabedian told Reuters.
The top five also included Suicide Squad, starring Will Smith, in fourth place, having made $5.65m (£4m) in its sixth week.
Meanwhile, The Wild Life, which tells the Robinson Crusoe story from the point of view of the island animals, opened at number five, with takings of $3.4m (£2.6m).
Further down the list came Kubo and the Two Strings in sixth with $3.2m (£2.4m), followed by Pete's Dragon with $2.9m (£2m).
The top 10 was completed by comedy animation Sausage Party, which made $2.3m (£1.7m).
