[SN]TITLE[SN]
Donald Trump's UK state visit to be debated by MPs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
MPs will debate whether US President Trump should be given a UK state visit, as a petition against the idea nears 1.7 million signatures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The debate, on 20 February, will also discuss a second petition calling for the visit to go ahead, signed by more than 100,000 people.
Mr Trump has put in place a temporary US travel ban on people from seven mainly Muslim countries.
This led to protests across the UK on Monday.
A state visit is the highest honour offered to foreign leaders by Queen Elizabeth II, the UK's head of state.
These are grand occasions, which aim to strengthen relationships between countries.
The Queen usually welcomes one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 109 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952.
There has been no date yet announced for President Trump's state visit.
