UK to face EU migration 'free-for-all', warns Michael Gove

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The UK will face a future migration "free-for-all" unless it leaves the European Union, Justice Secretary Michael Gove has warned.

Writing in the Times, he said any future expansion of the EU would pose a "direct and serious threat" to public services in the UK, including the NHS.
Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May is to argue being in the EU improves Britain's "clout" in the world.
She will make her first major speech of the EU referendum campaign later.
Mr Gove warned that five potential new members of the EU - Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania and Turkey - would result in millions more people having the right to move to the UK.
"Because we cannot control our borders - and because our deal sadly does nothing to change this fact - public services such as the NHS will face an unquantifiable strain as millions more become EU citizens," he wrote.
"There is a direct and serious threat to our public services, standard of living and ability to maintain social solidarity if we accept continued EU membership," he added.
Pro-Brexit campaigners have attempted to return the EU debate to the issue of immigration following US President Barack Obama's intervention in the debate.
On Friday, Mr Obama said the UK would be at the "back of the queue" for trade deals with the US, if it voted to leave the EU on 23 June.
His warning has been seen as a major boost for the Remain campaign.
However, writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mayor of London Boris Mr Johnson warned pro-EU campaigners not to "crow too soon".
He accused Prime Minister David Cameron of achieving "two-thirds of diddly squat" in his negotiations with Brussels for a special deal for Britain on immigration and other key demands.
"That deal shows how contemptuously we will be treated if we remain," Mr Johnson wrote.
On Sunday, Mr May said the free movement of workers within the EU made it more difficult to curb immigration to the UK.
But she told BBC's Andrew Marr Show it did not make it "impossible".
She said controlling immigration - whether from inside or outside the EU - "is hard".
Vote Leave said Mrs May had "given up" on trying to control immigration.
