A public appeal by a US military cemetery to "put a face" to each man, woman and child it commemorates has unearthed 1,000 photographs.

Nearly 9,000 Americans who died during World War Two are remembered at the Cambridge American Cemetery.
Staff located 3,000 photographs of former servicemen ahead of a public appeal in February.
Cemetery associate Tracey Haylock said the photographs help visitors realise how "really young most of them were".
The cemetery, at Madingley, near Cambridge, is the UK's only permanent US World War Two military burial ground.
It commemorates 8,914 people, including those for whom there are no remains because they were lost at sea, or who took off from UK air bases but were not seen alive again.
The photo appeal was launched to mark 75th anniversary of the "friendly invasion", when US forces first arrived in the UK in February 1942.
Guide Suzie Harrison said: "Being able to put a face to the name on a headstone or on the Wall of the Missing really resonates with visitors."
The photographs will be placed beside each headstone or along the Wall of the Missing in the run-up to US Memorial Day on 29 May.
