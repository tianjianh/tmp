A mother accused of murdering her baby boy had a photograph of him with a cannabis joint behind his ear, a jury heard.

Noah Serra-Morrison was 13-months-old when he died at his mother's home in Crawley Road, Luton, last November.
Prosecutors at Luton Crown Court claim the boy suffered a catalogue of injuries in the weeks before the massive head injury that killed him.
His mother Ronnie-Tayler Morrison and her partner Hardeep Hunjan deny murder.
The jury heard Ms Morrison, 21, had an iPhone with a photograph of Noah with a cannabis joint behind his ear.
And in a video clip on the same phone, the mother and Mr Hunjan were shown to the court smoking three cannabis joints at the same time through a home-made tube.
The baby died from a massive head injury inflicted on him at the flat in Crawley Road on the night of November 20/21 last year.
He was taken to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where he was pronounced dead in the early hours.
When he died it was found the child had suffered a series of fractures to his arms and legs, some new and some going back weeks.
The couple, said the prosecution, were to claim to that little Noah had injured himself by falling out of his crib.
That, said the crown, is impossible and the injuries found on the baby could not have been caused by an accident.
The case continues.
