Local businessmen Ian Battersby and Ian Currie were reported to have made an investment proposal through their company, Seneca Partners.
In March, the club's latest financial results revealed debts of Â£104.2m.
"We, the owners of the club, have no intention of selling or diluting our stake," Venky's said in a statement.
"We are totally and absolutely committed to supporting the club and endeavour for its advancement in all aspects."
Blackburn finished 15th in the Championship, and are without a manager after former boss Paul Lambert opted to leave the club at the end of the season.
