The Aberdonian finished joint third in the qualifying event at Walton Heath in England, where the top 15 were able to seal a spot at the major.
"I played in the US Open in 2007 with Tiger Woods and Geoff Ogilvy," Ramsay told BBC Scotland.
"And I'm very eager to get back and show that I've moved on from where I was."
Compatriot Russell Knox had already qualified for this season's event because he won a PGA Tour event last year.
"Anytime we get to represent Scotland, especially in the bigger tournaments at the majors, is a proud moment," said Ramsay.
"I'm proud to be in the US Open representing Scotland.
"The US Open is the perfect platform to showcase that I'm capable of mixing it with the best guys out there.
"I feel like I've got a lot more game, a lot more shots and a lot more mental toughness now."
England's Aaron Rai topped the field at Walton Heath with a 14-under-par total for his two rounds, one shot ahead of China's Haotong Li.
Ramsay, who shot two rounds of 66, was tied with Alexander Levy of France one shot further back.
Welshman Bradley Dredge, Ireland's Paul Dunne and English trio Andrew Johnston, Eddie Pepperell and Matt Wallace also qualified.
