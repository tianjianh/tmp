"Maicon was a member of Inter's treble-winning side in 2010. He has struggled with injury in recent seasons and there's a suspicion that his best days are behind him but when fit he remains one of the top right-backs in the world."
City boss Roberto Mancini managed the 31-year-old for two seasons between 2006 and 2008 when in charge of Inter.
The Brazilian began his career at Cruziero and had a spell at Monaco, before moving to Inter and making 235 appearances for the Serie A side.
Maicon will join up with his City team-mates after the forthcoming international break.
A right-back renowned for his attacking instincts, he scored 20 goals for Inter and has nearly 70 caps for Brazil.
The new arrival at the Etihad will join winger  and goalkeeper Richard Wright, while deals for  are expected before the end of the day.
