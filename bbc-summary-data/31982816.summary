Aberdeen's Rubislaw Quarry heritage centre faces being thrown out

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a multi-million pound attraction to celebrate Aberdeen's connection with granite face being thrown out.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Developers want to build a heritage centre at Rubislaw Quarry.
The majority of stone used for buildings in the city was extracted from the quarry.
But a planning official said they were likely to recommend the application be refused because dozens of trees would have to be removed.
Those behind the proposals have been asked to consider a city centre site for the attraction because there has been no detailed justification for why it must be located at the quarry.
Rubislaw Quarry, one of Europe's largest man-made holes, closed in 1971.
It is often credited with giving Aberdeen its Granite City name.
