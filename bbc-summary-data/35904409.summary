Firefighters were called to the park at about 14:50 after the Tornado ride came to a halt with members of the public stranded in their carriages.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said a cherry picker was used to lift five youths, a man and two women to safety.
No-one was injured in the incident.
The spokesman added: "SFRS officers remained in attendance to ensure the removal of the persons trapped was carried out in a safe manner."
The theme park at M&D's fully reopened for the summer season on Friday.
A spokesman for the park said: "We can confirm that the ride stopped during a cycle and the automated safety procedure was immediately initiated.
"No-one was hurt and all health and safety procedures were carried out. We have spoken individually to those involved and everyone is safe and well.
"The ride is now closed as we are carrying out a full investigation."
