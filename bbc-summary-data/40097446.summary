Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale says he is not 100% fit going into Saturday's Champions League final against Juventus in his home city of Cardiff.

The Wales striker has not played a game since suffering a damaged calf against Barcelona on 23 April.
The 27-year-old has missed Real's past eight games, including their final-day victory at Malaga to win their first La Liga title since 2012.
"If I'm called upon to start, I will start, obviously," said Bale.
The former Tottenham player is seeking a third Champions League triumph of his career.
He scored to help Real beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 after extra time in the 2014 final in Lisbon.
The Welshman also scored from the spot as his side overcame Atletico 5-3 on penalties in the 2016 final in Milan - when the game had ended 1-1 after 120 minutes.

Bale has endured an injury-plagued season, missing almost three months with an ankle injury he suffered in November, which required surgery.
"I'm not 100 percent," he added.
"I had my ankle operation, which still hasn't really recovered. I'd been in a lot of pain in training and have taken tablets to get through games.
"Obviously, any surgery is difficult, but in the middle of a season it's always that bit more difficult. You want to come back as soon as possible.

"In hindsight, I should have stayed out a bit longer and let it heal and strengthen. But obviously that wasn't the case. I'll live and I'll learn."
Real boss Zinedine Zidane has to choose whether to start Â£85m club-record signing Bale or keep faith with Isco, who has scored five goals in his past 11 appearances.
Isco, 25, found the net away to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-final second leg on 10 May.
"It's normal to have the debate because they are two very good and important players," added Zidane.
"The most important thing is to see the players on top form".

Having secured their first La Liga title for five years earlier this month, Real are looking to rewrite club history.
They have not been crowned champions of Spain and Europe in the same season since 1957-58.
Zidane spent five years playing for Saturday's opponents Juventus between 1996 and 2001, winning two Serie A titles before moving to Real.
The 44-year-old Frenchman is now looking to win the Champions League for the second time in 17 months as Real boss.
Asked about his future, Zidane said: "I have one more year on my contract but that doesn't mean anything.
"I want to be at this club but it depends on what you do on the field. The future: Saturday and nothing else".
