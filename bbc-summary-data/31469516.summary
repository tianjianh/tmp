An exhibition of global and local landmarks made from Lego has opened in Northumberland.

Artist Warren Elsmore has used the plastic bricks to recreate landmarks including the pyramids at Giza, St Pancras station, the Angel of the North and the Woodhorn Museum in Ashington, which is displaying his creations.
Hundreds of thousands of Lego bricks have been used to build the dozens of models in the exhibition.
The artist has been commissioned to build sculptures from Lego and has written books about his creations.
Mr Elsmore, who made a model of old London Bridge, said: "I liked playing with a Lego as a kid, I grew up and realised I could still play with Lego, why not?"
He said building the likes of the Great Wall of China was more fun than his his previous job.
"I did like my old IT career but you can't beat building with Lego," he said.
Mr Elsmore has recreated local landmarks including the Tyne Bridge, Bamburgh Castle and the Angel of the North. These sit alongside previous creations such as Moscow's Friendship of Nations Foundation and the welcome to Las Vegas sign.
His model of St Pancras is made of more than 120,000 bricks and took two years to build. It even features working trains running from six platforms.
The Brick Planet exhibition opened earlier and will be at the museum until the end of May.
