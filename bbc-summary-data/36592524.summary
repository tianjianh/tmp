Northern Ireland - in their first appearance at a Euros and first major tournament since 1986 - will now meet either Wales or France for a place in the quarter-finals.
Michael O'Neill's side lost 1-0 to Germany on Tuesday but finished third in Group C, with their tally of three points enough to see them advance on goal difference.
Turkey's 2-0 victory against the Czech Republic ensured that Northern Ireland will be one of the four best third-placed teams who will go on to join the group winners and runners-up in the knockout stages.
A tie against Wales would take place on Saturday (kick-off 17:00 BST) in Paris, or they will play France in Lyon on Sunday (14:00).
The Republic of Ireland will qualify for the last 16 if they beat Italy on Wednesday (20:00 BST).
Italy, who are already through to the next round for a last-16 meeting with holders Spain, are set to make "between seven and nine" changes for the game, according to boss Antonio Conte.

"It's surreal," O'Neill told BBC Radio 5 live. "We were just on the coach so have been following on the BBC website. I'm not sure it's really sunk in yet, but it's a fantastic achievement.
"We knew the group would be difficult. What we saw tonight was a team that refused to be beaten by a big margin and did everything possible to stay in the game.
"Over the three games we deserve to be in the last 16. What we went through tonight will prepare us for anything in the next round and our players will be ready for whoever."
Asked whether he would rather face Wales or France, O'Neill added: "If I was picking a team I thought we had a better chance against I would say Wales, but we'll see who comes out after the final group games on Wednesday."

Wales now know that they will either play Northern Ireland, Turkey or Albania.
Roy Hodgson's England side play their last-16 match on Monday at 20:00 BST against the side that finishes second in Group F.
By failing to finish top of Group B, England now find themselves in the same side of the draw as Spain, Italy, Germany, France and, potentially, Portugal.
Wales' reward for finishing in first place is an apparently kinder route through the tournament.
Switzerland, Poland and Croatia are in their side of the draw and could be joined by Belgium and Portugal if they both qualify from their respective groups. Belgium face Sweden in Group E on Wednesday, while Portugal play Hungary in Group F.
Defending champions Spain lost for the first time at a European Championship since 2004 when they were beaten 2-1 by Croatia on Tuesday.
They will face Italy in the last 16 and, like England, will have to come through a tough side of the draw to reach the final.
Group A: France and Switzerland
Group B: Wales and England
Group C: Germany and Poland
Group D: Croatia and Spain
Group E: Italy
Group F: Hungary
Best third-placed teams: Slovakia and Northern Ireland
A further two best third-placed spots are still available for the last-16 stage, with Albania clinging on having gained three points in Group A.
Two further places are still up for grabs in Groups E and F who play their final group matches on Wednesday.
Romania, Russia and the Czech Republic managed just one point each and Ukraine failed to collect a goal or a point.
