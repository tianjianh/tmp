The couple tied the knot at the Oxfordshire palace on Friday.
The building, courtyards and formal gardens at the palace, classed as a World Heritage Site, had to close early ahead of the wedding.
The couple got engaged in December 2010 during a holiday on the Caribbean island of Antigua.
A notice warned visitors of the closure saying it was due to a "large private event".
"The park, the new east courtyard facility and the pleasure gardens will be open until 6.00pm as normal" it stated.
Mr Humes, 27, found fame in JLS when they came second on The X Factor in 2008. They have had five UK number one singles, including Everybody in Love.
They also performed the 2012 BBC Sport Relief song, Proud.
The Saturdays' hits include Just Can't Get Enough, a cover of the Depeche Mode song.
Miss Wiseman, 23, was previously a member of S Club Juniors.
Blenheim Palace was a gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, following his victory at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.
It was also the birthplace of Winston Churchill in 1874.
