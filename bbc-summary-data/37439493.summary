Energy firm E.On is paying a total of £3.1m after it missed appointments with customers and then failed to pay them compensation.

The company is handing £1.9m to energy charities and will pay £1.2m in compensation to customers.
Ofgem's chief executive Dermot Nolan said: "E.On fell well short of the high standards we expect for consumers."
E.On said it had written to the customers affected to apologise and to send them the money owed.
The energy supplier said it missed around 35,000 appointments between 2011 and 2015 and failed to pay compensation.
As part of the energy industry's guaranteed standards, suppliers must pay customers if they fail to turn up for appointments.
At the time, E.On paid £20 for a missed gas appointment and £22 for a missed electricity appointment, but it failed to hand over appropriate payments to customers affected.
Now some 24,000 private customers and small businesses have been handed cheques of between £40 and £44, the company said, double the original payouts due.
"All possible payments were completed by the end of August 2016 and totalled around £1.2m," the company said in a statement.
"We will also make a payment of £1.9m to two charities, National Energy Action and Citizens Advice, to reflect the amount of redress payments where we could not identify individual customers affected or where customers could no longer be traced."
The compensation payment climbed to £30 in January this year.
