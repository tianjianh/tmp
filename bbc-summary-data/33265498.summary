Clodagh Cogley posted on Facebook about her injuries sustained in the tragedy, that killed six students last week.
"The fall from the balcony left me with two collapsed lungs, a broken shoulder, a broken knee, five broken ribs and a broken spinal cord... meaning the chances of me using my legs again are pretty bleak," she wrote.
"Not the best odds but I'm moving to a great rehabilitation centre here in San Francisco for two months (it has dog therapy) and intend to give it everything I've got."
The incident happened during a 21st birthday party in the Californian city in the early hours of 16 June.
Inspectors have confirmed that wooden beams supporting the balcony had been badly rotted by water damage.
Clodagh said she was determined to live life to the full.
"The thing I'm taking from this tragedy is that life is short and I intend to honour those who died by living the happiest and most fulfilling life possible.
"Enjoy a good dance and the feeling of grass beneath your feet like it's the last time because in this crazy world you never know when it might be."
Five of the six people who died were Irish students based in the US as part of a work exchange programme.
