Warren Joyce: Former Wigan manager takes charge of Melbourne City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wigan Athletic manager Warren Joyce has taken charge of Australian A-League club Melbourne City.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joyce, 52, has been out of work since being sacked by the Latics on 13 March after four months in charge.
Before joining Wigan, he had spent eight years as Manchester United reserve team manager, and worked with Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford.
Melbourne City are part of the City Football Group, run by Manchester City's Abu Dhabi-based owners.
Joyce was Hull City's player-manager between 1998 and 2000, then in 2006 joined Royal Antwerp, which at the time was a feeder club for United, and led directly to his move to Old Trafford.
Melbourne City won the Australian Cup last season but a poor A-League play-off campaign ended with elimination by Perth Glory.
