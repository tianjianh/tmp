All four suspects are all now in custody. They are accused of dividing the eggs between them, Xinhua reported.

Three of the suspects are accused of helping Mr Wang steal the eggs on the evening of 9 January and then fleeing to Shanghai.
China is one of the world's biggest sources of fossils, especially the southern city of Heyuan,
Many fossils found in China and nearby Mongolia are often exported illegally and sold for large profits to collectors.
