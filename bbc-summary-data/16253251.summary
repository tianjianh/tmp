More abuse allegations for Lissue House

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are believed to be investigating five cases of alleged abuse at two hospitals, the BBC has learned.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two of the alleged cases happened in 1979. Details of the others are not clear yet.
People who say they suffered abuse have come forward since a health service report in abuse at Lissue House and Forster Green was leaked to the Irish News in October.
The Stinson Report contained allegations of abuse at the hospitals in the 1980s and 1990s.
The report was completed in 2009 but was never published.
It dealt with allegations that children suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse.
The review was instigated by the Belfast Trust and the Eastern Health Board after one former patient made a complaint to police.
The Belfast Health Trust said it reported allegations to the Eastern Board and to the Department of Health.
In October, Health Minister Edwin Poots told the assembly that there had been no cover-up into allegations of abuse at the two hospitals.
Mr Poots said that the Stinson report indicated that the regime was harsh and and a small number of staff may have committed acts of abuse.
He also said he was "extremely annoyed" that he was not given an interim briefing on the allegations at the hospitals.
In relation to the two allegations of abuse in 1979, Belfast Trust said it was unable to comment on staff issues from that period as it did not manage Lissue Hospital at that time.
