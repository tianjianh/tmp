Bournemouth's Harry Arter acted with "real dignity" by playing in the 2-1 win over Manchester United shortly after the death of his daughter, said boss Eddie Howe.

Midfielder Arter, 25, and his partner lost their child at birth in midweek.
Despite his loss, Arter played for 86 minutes in a surprise victory as the Cherries added to last Saturday's 1-0 win over champions Chelsea.
"It's been a hugely emotional week for him," said Howe.
"I think he's handled himself with real dignity throughout the process, and to play the way he did today, with the emotions running through his body, I can't credit him enough for that."
Republic of Ireland international Arter was close to tears after being booked after 84 minutes, and was substituted two minutes later before being embraced by his manager at the full-time whistle.
Junior Stanislas opened the scoring by curling home direct from a corner before Marouane Fellaini's scruffy finish.
But Bournemouth sealed the win through Joshua King's strike from a well-worked corner which lifts the Cherries to 14th in the table, three points above the relegation zone.
"He showed real strength to keep his emotions in check, and I've got to say his team-mates rallied around him really well," added Howe.
"There were some emotional scenes in the dressing room afterwards.
"I'm really proud of him, but the pain for them won't go away, so we'll have to look after Harry, and our thoughts are with him and his family at this time.
"Harry wanted to play, there was no doubt in his mind that he wanted to play. I had to make an assessment of him, but there was no doubt once I'd spoken to him that I was going to play him today."
