Rudi Garcia's first game in charge of Marseille ended in a battling goalless draw against Paris St-Germain.

The ex-Roma boss, 52, was appointed last week after Marseille's takeover by American businessman Frank McCourt.
Garcia's side failed to register a shot on goal in the match but defended brilliantly at the Parc des Princes.
Edinson Cavani was denied a penalty and missed a hat-trick of chances for the hosts as PSG lost ground on Ligue 1 leaders Nice, who won 4-2 at Metz.
Alassane Plea's hat-trick for Nice helped clinch an impressive away win for the Cote d'Azur side as they moved on to 26 points.
Nice are now four points ahead of Monaco and six points clear of third-placed PSG.
