[SN]TITLE[SN]
'Errors' which let killer slip in Rachel Nickell probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Serial rapist Robert Napper was brought to the attention of Metropolitan Police as early as 1989, but a series of "bad errors" allowed the 42-year-old to slip the net, a report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Napper was linked to a series of rapes and attempted rapes in a south London parkland, known as the Green Chain, but was cleared for being "too tall".
He went on to kill Rachel Nickell in 1992 and Samantha Bissett and her four-year-old daughter Jazmine in 1993.
Napper pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility in December 2008.
