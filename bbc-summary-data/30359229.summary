Hartlepool United have sacked manager Paul Murray after Friday's FA Cup defeat by non-league Blyth Spartans.

The 38-year-old former midfielder had only been in charge since October after the departure of Colin Cooper.
A 90th-minute goal from Jarrett Rivers sent the Northern Premier League side through to Monday's third round draw.
Pools are bottom of League Two, six points away from safety, and have put Sam Collins in temporary charge of the first team.

Murray had described his side's second-half performance against Blyth as "diabolical."
He told the BBC: "There was no fight, no passion, we thought we had it won. That's been the story in the league as well. There were angry words exchanged in the dressing room."
The former Oldham coach was Hartlepool's sixth manager since Mick Wadsworth's departure in December 2011 with no boss since Danny Wilson from 2006 to 2008 lasting two years in the job.
