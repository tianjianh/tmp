[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Scottish Wildlife Trust's Montrose Basin visitor centre will receive a Â£37,800 revamp at the start of 2017.

The visitor centre will close for about six weeks from New Year's Day to allow the improvements to take place.
Montrose Basin Wildlife Reserve is best known for attracting tens of thousands of wintering pink-footed geese each year.
Displays in the visitor centre will be replaced and screens showing footage of local wildlife will be installed.
The improvement project received the money through the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The visitor centre attracts about 12,000 visitors per year.
Manager Caroline Hendry said: "The centre opened in 1995 and our last refurbishment was nearly ten years ago, so it's a good time to refresh our displays and make the most of new technology that has developed since then.
"I'm positive people will love the changes we're planning to make.
"When we reopen in February visitors will be able to discover much more about the amazing variety of wildlife that lives on the basin."
