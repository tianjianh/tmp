Braintree Town 0-0 Maidstone United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree and Maidstone played out a goalless draw in the National League at Cressing Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Both sides struggled to create chances, but Maidstone goalkeeper Lee Worgan had to be alert to block Monty Patterson's effort with his feet early on.
Braintree striker Jack Midson had the ball in the back of the net towards the end of the second half, but it was ruled out for offside and that was as close as either side came to scoring.
Maidstone remain in the drop zone despite the point, although they are now only behind Woking on goal difference, while Braintree drop one place to 17th.
