Australian police are looking to identify a group of men filmed riding motorised park benches on public roads in Perth.

Footage of the nine men casually rolling through an intersection in Scarborough on Sunday has gone viral.
While witnesses said they were amused by the spectacle, police said there were real dangers involved.
They said the men could face several charges, including driving an unlicensed and unroadworthy vehicle.
"Police are concerned for the safety of those riding on the tables with no protective clothing, especially when on roads alongside motor vehicles," Western Australian police said in a Facebook post.
The owner of the table said an officer already spoke to the group and let them off with a warning, according to reports.
"Both drivers were sober, the police asked us to push them back across the road to the beach. We complied with all requests by police on Sunday," he told 9News Perth.
The tables are equipped with a motor and a lever with what appears to be a brake attached. The mechanism for steering the table is not visible in photos or videos.
Several Australians have been booked drink-driving onboard similar vehicles, including motorised cooler boxes known as "Eskys", this year.
In January a man on Victoria's Mornington Peninsula was fined $1,476 for riding an unlicensed ice box on the footpath.
