The Ulster hosts dominated from the start and Peter Brown opened the scoring before an Alex Burns own goal doubled their lead.
The tie was made safe three minutes before the interval when Eugene Magee dribbled the ball into the circle before finishing on the reverse stick.
Corinthians and UCD also progressed to the semi-finals.
Mossley went down to a 4-0 defeat at the hands of Corinthians while Cookstown once again lost out to UCD.
The Dublin university side had relegated Cookstown from the Irish Hockey League last season by winning the play-off and again left the Ulster side devastated by winning this cup tie on penalty strokes after the game finished 1-1.
Banbridge bossed the game from the first minute when a long overhead from Matthew Bell forced a penalty corner.
While the execution wasn't perfect the situation was retrieved by Johnny McKee and his pass found the unmarked Brown and he put the hosts ahead.
The second goal came as a result of constant pressure from Banbridge.
Once again McKee was instrumental in the build up and his cross from the left was turned into his own net by Burns before Magee added the third.
The other quarter-final tie between Instonians and Monkstown was postponed because of a frozen pitch at Shaw's Bridge.
The semi-final draw will take place on Monday.
