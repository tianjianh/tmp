Wonky Beeston Christmas tree gets the chop

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Christmas tree that tilted so much it was compared to the Leaning Tower of Pisa has been taken down due to safety fears.

The tree was in the Nottinghamshire town of Beeston - which coincidentally could be twinned with the Italian region of Tuscany, where Pisa is.
Dubbed the Leaning Tree of Beeston, it started to tilt because someone removed its supports on two separate occasions.
The council was worried severe weather could blow the tree down.
Adam Guest, 20, from nearby Chilwell, said: "I've seen people look up at it and they're practically laughing at it because it's so slanted.
"From one angle it does look like it's leaning more than the tower in Pisa.
"It just looks a bit tragic really."
It was taken down on Friday evening and a new tree is due to be installed on Monday.
Jackie Harwood wrote on BBC Radio Nottingham's Facebook page: "Such a shame that vandals have to spoil this tradition for everyone else. Shame on those who vandalised the stand."
Broxtowe Borough Council said the tree posed "a potential safety risk to members of the public, particularly with the severe weather warnings in place for the weekend".
The council said in a statement: "In the meantime, visitors to Beeston can still enjoy the Christmas tree at Broadgate Park and the other decorations throughout the town centre."
