BMA stands ground in contract row

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Industrial action by junior doctors in England is still on the cards after union leaders refused to re-enter talks over a new contract.

The British Medical Association announced last month it would be balloting members over taking action.
It prompted Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to intervene last week, suggesting he could give ground.
But the union's leaders said the offer did "not yet have the concrete assurances we asked for".
In a letter to Mr Hunt, the BMA is asking for more detail on unsociable hours payments and whether some doctors will be worse off.
The dispute is over a new contract due to be introduced in August 2016.
Critics have argued the deal could mean 15% pay cuts, with "normal hours" reclassified as being from 07:00 to 22:00, Monday to Saturday.
It means extra payments for unsociable working will be earned only outside of these times, rather than the current arrangements of 07:00 to 19:00 Monday to Friday.
But Mr Hunt's letter last week suggested he would be "pleased to discuss" a compromise on the definition of normal hours on a Saturday.
The letter also sought to reassure doctors that the contract was not a "cost-cutting exercise" and that the "great majority" of doctors would remain as well paid as they were now.
The BMA's letter on Monday in response said there was still a lack of clarity and asked for further guarantees.
These include - among others - asking for a commitment that no doctor will lose out.
Earlier, it was reported that 2,000 rank-and-file doctors had also written to Mr Hunt asking for further concessions.
The government has described the current contracts as "outdated" and "unfair", pointing out they were introduced in the 1990s.
Ministers drew up plans to change the contract in 2012, but talks broke down last year.
The government has indicated it will impose the new contract next year in England, prompting the BMA to ask its 50,000 junior doctor members about industrial action.
Scotland and Wales have said they do not want to introduce the changes, while Northern Ireland has yet to make a decision.
