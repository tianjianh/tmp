Mike Cooper: St George Illawarra Dragons prop rejoins Warrington Wolves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington have re-signed England prop Mike Cooper from NRL side St George Illawarra Dragons on a three-year contract starting from next season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cooper left the club to join Dragons in 2013, with an agreement to rejoin the club when he returned from Australia.
The 27-year-old played all three matches in England's home series win against New Zealand last year.
"It's great news and a great signing for the club," Warrington head coach Tony Smith said.
"It's something that we hoped for a few years ago, that Mike would eventually return to our club, but it's probably a little sooner than we thought considering how well he's done."
Warrington are currently second in the Super League table, two points behind leaders Hull FC after 17 games.
