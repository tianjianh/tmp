Hurling League: Saffrons defeat Lilywhites as Armagh fall to defeat

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Antrim maintained their unbeaten record in Division 2A with a 1-16 to 1-14 victory over Kildare in Cushendall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Lilywhites went in 0-8 to 0-7 ahead at the break and it remained close with Antrim forward Ciaran Clarke netting before a goal from Brian Byrne.
Antrim edged in front late on to win it and they only trail leaders Carlow on points difference.
Armagh are still seeking a first league win after a 3-29 to 0-16 defeat by Westmeath in Ennis.
Westmeath moved into an early six-point lead and they remained dominant with the hosts holding a 0-17 to 0-7 advantage at half-time.
The three goals came in the second half as Allan Devine, Eoin Price and Brendan Murtagh netted for the Leinster side, who started the day without a point from two games.
Kildare topped the table before meeting Antrim but were quickly two points down after the opening scores from Paddy Burke and Clarke.
The visitors responded and led by a single point at the interval, only for Eoghan Campbell to level on the restart.
Kildare moved three points clear but were pegged back by Clarke's goal and then Antrim were three in front when Byrne found the net.
Late points from Clarke, Conor Johnston and Daniel McKernan helped the Saffrons to a two-point victory.
"I'm very happy with the result - we should have won easier but we showed great character," said Antrim joint-manager Terence McNaughton.
"This group of young players are committed to Antrim hurling and everything is in our own hands now in the league."
