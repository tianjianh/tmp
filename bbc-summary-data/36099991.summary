David Walliams has had children's letters that had been stolen returned to him by the police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The actor and writer tweeted that Met Police had "kindly returned a number of children's letters to me that had been stolen in December."
He added that he had "now replied to them all".
Last week he had apologised to fans if they had not received replies from him as he had just found out a large box of letters had been stolen.
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a member of the public had found items of discarded mail in Camden on 8 April.
They said they were looking into whether an offence had been committed.
The box of letters had been posted to him by his publisher Harper Collins.
Walliams told fans that he endeavoured to reply to every fan letter and suggested those without a response should "please write again".
The Britain's Got Talent judge is a best-selling children's author.
He has written eight books for HarperCollins, including Gangsta Granny and Mr Stink that have been turned into TV adaptations.
