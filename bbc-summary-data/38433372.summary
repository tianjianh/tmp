Accrington Stanley 2-2 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Defender Scott Harrison scored a late equaliser for Hartlepool to salvage a point in a 2-2 draw with fellow strugglers Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The first half had few chances with the best falling to Stanley's Shay McCartan in the ninth minute but his close-range effort was straight at goalkeeper Adam Bartlett.
The game came to life after the break when Matty Pearson was fouled by Liam Donnelly in the area and Billy Kee fired the resulting penalty into the left-hand corner for his ninth goal of the season.
Their joy was short-lived, however, as Hartlepool replied within three minutes when a Jordan Richards cross found the head of former Stanley striker Padraig Amond and he too celebrated his ninth of the campaign.
Stanley went back in front after 70 minutes when a Sean McConville corner found the head of defender Pearson who powered the ball home.
But Pools came back again when a free-kick caused chaos in the Accrington area and Harrison drove in an 86th-minute equaliser.
