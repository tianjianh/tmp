Bradford City 0-0 Scunthorpe United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bradford were held to their third draw in a row as they shared a goalless stalemate with leaders Scunthorpe in front of their biggest crowd of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21,874 fans at Valley Parade saw City enjoy the bulk of the possession, but they could not add the finishing touches to some attractive football and almost fell victim to some decent counter-attacking play by the visitors.
Bradford created the best chances in the first half but the nearest they went to scoring was in the 33rd minute when James Meredith's left-wing cross was deflected in to the path of Filipe Morais whose left-foot shot was saved by the diving Luke Daniels.
Scunthorpe's best first-half effort was a 25-yard shot from League One's top scorer Josh Morris against his former club but he was denied by Colin Doyle's save.
The Bantams went close to scoring at the start of the second half when Timothee Dieng and then Morais had shots blocked in the box after Scunthorpe's defence failed to clear Meredith's low cross.
At the other end, Morris had a 20-yard free-kick saved at the near post by Doyle and then fired over from 20 yards in the 67th minute after Paddy Madden's through-ball left him clear on goal.
In another counter-attack, Tom Hopper could only divert Madden's left-wing cross wide at full stretch.
