Northampton Town: Not enough home kit for first home match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
We've all been there when someone forgets to bring the kit for your game and you are either left with the dregs from the lost property box or "go skins".

And similar has now happened to Northampton Town, as a delivery delay with the suppliers has left them without enough home kit to wear for their first match of the season at their Sixfields Stadium.
Instead, Rob Page's side will have to start their first campaign back in League One following promotion last year in their away kit.
That on top of a lack of retail kit ahead of the game against Fleetwood, and it is fair to say that Cobblers chairman Kelvin Thomas is not best pleased with the suppliers.
"We are so disappointed it is hard to really put into words," he told the club website.
"There were a few reasons we made the decision that we did in terms of kit supplier and aside from the quality, the timing of supply was one of the main reasons for it and we have been really let down.
"Not only will there be a financial impact for the club, but also a reputational hit and worst of all fans will be disappointed.
"We will be having further discussions with Just Sport and Nike about why and how this has happened, to get a firm date of delivery and to discuss next steps."
As a gesture to fans, Thomas confirmed the club have agreed with suppliers Just Sport that anyone who has pre-ordered the shirt would receive a free Northampton Town T-shirt.
On the final day of the 2013-14 season Bristol Rovers faced Mansfield Town in a match the Gas needed a draw from to save them from relegation out of the Football League.
However, the Stags arrived at the Memorial Stadium without any kit of their own, meaning they had to wear Rovers' away shirts.
And with their new threads Mansfield defeated their hosts 1-0, meaning Rovers were sent down by a goal from a man in their own kit. Ouch.
More recently, in this summer's European Championships, four Switzerland players had their shirts ripped off their backs against hosts France.
Sportswear manufacturer Puma blamed faulty material for the incidents, but it gave us one of the quotes of the tournament from Switzerland winger Xherdan Shaqiri: "I hope Puma does not produce condoms."
Famously, Manchester United, losing 3-0 at half-time at Southampton, changed out of their infamous grey kits during the break.
Why? Because manager Sir Alex Ferguson thought his players were unable to see each other on the pitch. United lost 3-1.
