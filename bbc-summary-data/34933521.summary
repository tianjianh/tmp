[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A late Adam Ashe try snatched victory for Glasgow Warriors on Friday night against an impressive Benetton Treviso.

The Italian visitors are winless this season and lie bottom of the Pro12.
But they had led for much of this match through two Jayden Hayward penalties.
The Warriors could not break Treviso's resistance, until number eight Ashe's 72nd minute effort from a five-metre scrum, with replacement pivot Duncan Weir adding a conversion and a late penalty to seal the win.
Head coach Gregor Townsend had made eight alterations to the side that lost in disappointing fashion to Northampton Saints in last weekend's European Champions Cup clash.
If he was seeking an emphatic response to that defeat, then Townsend might have been left a little underwhelmed at his team's display - especially given the calibre of his line-up - though it is worth remembering that Treviso visited Scotstoun under similar circumstances a year ago and were only narrowly beaten.
They too made several changes in among the backline, New Zealander Hayward starting at stand-off outside countryman Chris Smylie.
It was Scotland pivot Finn Russell, however, who opened the scoring for the hosts from the tee after three minutes.
His opposite number swiftly cancelled out that effort, and took Treviso into the lead with his second penalty on the half-hour mark.
The Warriors toiled away for much of the second period, failing to overcome the Italian defence, before a period of pressure in the visitors' 22 yielded a penalty in front of the posts.
Rather than kick for goal to level the scores, Glasgow opted to scrummage, and from the set-piece, Ashe plunged over to the delight of a sold-out Scotstoun.
Weir converted, and stretched his side's lead in the dying minutes with a penalty.
