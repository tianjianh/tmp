Having made scores of seven, 23, one and eight in his four Test innings on the tour, Azhar hit 81 from 140 balls in their two-day game at Worcester.

After Pakistan declared on 261-3, the hosts reached 30-0 by the close.
With the four-match series level at 1-1, the third Test begins at Edgbaston on Wednesday.
