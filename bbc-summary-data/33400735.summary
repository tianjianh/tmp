Two men have been arrested after jumping into the Ouse in York, despite being warned by police about the dangers of river swimming.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In 2014 four people drowned in rivers at various spots in the city.
Volunteers on the York Rescue Boat were sent to King's Staith on Saturday evening but the men had left the water.
Police said both men, aged in their 20s, were arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly.
In May 2014, Dr Mandeep Ahluwalia was found in the River Ouse near St Peter's School playing fields in Clifton.
He was the fourth person to have died in a York river that year.
In January, 20-year-old student Megan Roberts drowned, also in the Ouse.
In March, Ben Clarkson, 22, drowned in the River Foss, while in April soldier Tyler Pearson, 18, drowned in the Ouse.
Ms Roberts, Mr Clarkson and Mr Pearson had all been on nights out with friends.
