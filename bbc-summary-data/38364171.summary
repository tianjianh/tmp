Two children's football teams may fold after local FA officials banned them from playing in "inappropriately" sponsored kit, says their manager.

Birmingham-based Kings Heath Concorde's children's teams wear kits sponsored by a nightclub and tattoo parlour.
Birmingham County FA said the sponsors provided age-restricted services so advertising on children's kit was against the rules.
The club says it cannot afford to pay Â£400 to replace each team's kit.

Manager Russell Jukes said he had sent 50 letters to local firms for sponsorship, with the Arena nightclub in Stourbridge and Warstones Body Art agreeing to sponsor the teams.
But following a complaint, he said the club was told by the FA that the teams were banned from playing in the kit and it must be changed.
A letter from Birmingham County FA to Mr Jukes said: "We consider that the advertising of a tattoo parlour and a nightclub on U10 and U8 team shirts would be in breach of Regulation A8.
"They are age-restricted products/services and therefore inappropriate given the age of the players in question, who are significantly younger than 18."
Mr Jukes said the club operated on a "shoestring" budget.
"I'm hoping that some firms will come forward and offer sponsorship. If we don't get sponsorship coming forward, we will have to fold the two teams," he said.
He said about 30 children who attend training and play for the teams would be left disappointed.
