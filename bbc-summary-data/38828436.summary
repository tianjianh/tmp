Forest beat bottom-of-the-table Rotherham United 2-0 to go 18th in the Championship, eight points clear of the relegation zone.
Burton boss Nigel Clough ruled out a return to Forest as boss on Monday.
Brazil, 54, said the transfer window meant he had not had time to consider taking the job on a longer-term basis.
Forest sacked Philippe Montanier on 14 January, with Brazil taking charge immediately.
"Me and a number of key staff are trying very hard to make sure we do the job properly," he told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"We are making sure we can get ourselves in a sensible place in the league where a squad of this quality should be.
"Right now all the concentration has been going to the end of January on the window. The days have been long and we have worked hard on the training squad, and trying to strengthen the squad."
