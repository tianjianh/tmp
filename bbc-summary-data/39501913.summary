Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy says injured defenders Jonas Knudsen and Steven Taylor could miss the end of the Championship season.

Knudsen, 24, did not play in Tuesday's 3-0 home win over Wigan, while Taylor, 31, went off during the first half.
Centre-back Taylor suffered suspected recurrence of a hamstring injury that had kept him out since February.
Of left-back Knudsen, McCarthy told BBC Suffolk: "He's damaged his shoulder. It looks like he'll need an operation."
McCarthy continued: "He could rest it for three or four weeks and come back, but we've got six games to play.
"The last thing I want is to bring him back in the last game and he gets injured and misses the start of pre-season."
With six games left, the Tractor Boys are 17th in the Championship table, nine points clear of the relegation zone.
Speaking after the win over the Latics, former Wolves and Sunderland boss McCarthy praised the recent performances of Polish goalkeeper Bartosz Bialkowski.
The 29-year-old has played in all but one of Town's league fixtures this season, keeping 11 clean sheets in the process.
Asked whether he expected enquiries about the ex-Notts County goalkeeper in the summer, McCarthy said: "Every chance. I've already bigged him up as the best in the league.
"We've got him under contract, but we all know if a huge offer comes in from a big club, then it's difficult to stop it if it's the right deal. Let's hope not."
