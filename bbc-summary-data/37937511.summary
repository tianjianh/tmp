[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Our view is clear. We can't talk about easing the conditions for access to the single market on the one hand while Britain rejects those elements it sees as less attractive on the other." (Joint news conference with visiting British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Berlin, 4 November, via Die Welt)
"Great Britain is leaving the European Union, but is leaving not Europe, much less leaving good relations with Germany behind it." (Joint news conference with visiting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Berlin, 4 November, via Die Welt)
"You know I was not overly delighted [by Boris Johnson's support for Leave]." (Joint news conference with visiting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Berlin, 4 November, via Die Welt)
"A further delay [in starting talks] harms both sides." (Joint news conference with visiting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Berlin, 4 November, via Die Welt)
"There is no question of going to war or negotiating in a spirit of revenge with the British; but if the British really want to have free access to the internal market, they must agree to respect all its rules, including on the free movement of workers. Europe should not waiver on its principles to have peace in its relations with our British friends. Europe is Europe, and if you want to be part of the main achievement, the internal market, everyone including the British must respect the rules." (Speech in Bruges, 8 November, via Reuters)
"I take issue with the attempts in some countries, especially in industrial circles, to reach an agreement with the British for their sector before the other 27 [member states] have spoken." (Interview with Belgian newspaper Le Soir, 5 November, via Reuters)
"I am very concerned by the political and media reaction in the United Kingdom to the Divisional Court's ruling last week that Parliament would need to trigger the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. These were blatant attacks on the independence of the judiciary designed to stir up popular hatred, not just against the so-called "enemies of the people" but also those who brought the claim to the courts... A stronger message is now needed from the UK government which clearly condemns the personal attacks on the judges and the targeting of those individuals who brought the challenge to the courts." (On Facebook, 7 November)
