Llangefni primary schools shake-up set for consultation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A planned shake-up of primary schools in an Anglesey town is set to take a step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anglesey councillors will look at two options for the future of Corn Hir, Bodffordd, Esceifiog, Talwrn, Henblas and Y Graig schools in Llangefni.
The Executive Committee will meet on Monday and recommend whether schools should close, be merged or replaced with new buildings.
The next step would be to agree to put them out to public consultation.
Anglesey council has consulted with parents, governors and staff in the six schools in the area and with local councillors and the Welsh Government.
