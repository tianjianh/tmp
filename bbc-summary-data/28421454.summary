The company that owns the Go chain of filling stations made pre-tax profits of £14m in 2013, unchanged from 2012.

The filling stations are part of the Cookstown-based Lissan Coal Company, which has a diverse range of energy businesses.
It is one of Ireland's largest coal importers, co-owns an oil terminal in Londonderry and supplies electricity to businesses.
Turnover rose from £545m to £579m, more than double what it was four years ago.
A note in the accounts states that the firm has acquired a 25% stake in Centurion Bulk, a Singapore-based cargo chartering company.
It is also continuing to expand the filling station chain with a number of planning applications lodged recently.
The company employed 156 people in 2013 up from 128 in 2012.
The firm is owned by Cookstown man Michael Loughran and his family.
