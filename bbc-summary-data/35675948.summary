Braintree Town 2-0 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Braintree beat Eastleigh to continue their National League play-off push, as both sides finished with 10-men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simeon Akinola opened the scoring with a fine solo effort, nutmegging his marker before firing into the net.
The Spitfires' Jamie Turley was then sent off for a second booking after a scything tackle on Akinola.
Braintree's Matt Fry was also dismissed for two yellow cards, but Akinola doubled their lead from close-range to seal the win.
