The early career of tennis champion Boris Becker is to become a TV movie, after the star sold the rights to his life story.

The film will follow Becker from childhood to his first Wimbledon final in 1985, when he became the first unseeded player to win the tournament.
"There's a right time for everything in life," said Becker.
"Now, on the 30th anniversary of my first big win, it seems the time has come to tell the story in a movie."
The film will be made by German company Pantaleon Entertainment, who described it as a "big-budget international tentpole TV event".
"Boris Becker wrote sports history with his amazing victory," said CEO Dan Maag. "It's a tale of courage, determination and the unstoppable will to keep going in the face of adversity.
Becker had a brief but brilliant tennis career in the run-up to his Wimbledon debut.
Born in Leimen, West Germany, he learned the game at the hometown tennis centre, Blau-Weiss Tennisklub, which his father, an architect, had built.
He started playing competitively at age eight, occasionally practicing with Steffi Graf, and by 12 years old was concentrating almost wholly on the game.
After winning the West German junior championship aged 15, he turned professional and began to dominate the game with a powerful serve that earned him the nickname "Boom Boom".
In 1985, he rewrote the record books at Wimbledon, taking just three hours and 18 minutes to overpower eighth-seeded Kevin Curren, a South-African-born American.
He was not just an unseeded outsider but at 17, he was also the youngest person ever to lift the men's singles trophy - a record that stands to this day.
Proving the victory was not a fluke, he won the Wimbledon men's singles championship again the following year, and for a third time in 1989.
He retired from professional tennis in 1999, after an emotional return to Wimbledon in which he lost in the fourth round, but has recently returned to the circuit to coach world number one Novak Djokovic.
By concentrating on his early years, the TV movie will avoid covering the public scandals that dogged Becker post-retirement.
After a messy divorce from his wife Barbara in January 2001, he admitted he had fathered a baby girl by Russian model Angela Ermakova.
Then, in October 2002, he was given a two-year suspended sentence for failing to pay 1.7 million euros ($1.7m) in tax.
