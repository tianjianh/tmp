England coach Peter Moores says he is focused on this month's tour of the West Indies and not on Kevin Pietersen.

Moores said batsman Pietersen "isn't on the radar" while they prepare for the three-Test series starting on 13 April.
Incoming England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) chairman Colin Graves has spoken to Pietersen about a return to international duty.
The 34-year-old was sacked in February 2014 following the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia.
Moores was England coach in 2009 when he and the South Africa-born player suffered an "irretrievable breakdown" of their relationship that led to Moores being sacked and Pietersen resigning as captain.
The batsman has said he could work again with the coach, who was reappointed in April 2014.
Speaking ahead of their flight to the Caribbean on Thursday, Moores said: "My focus is to support [Test captain] Alastair Cook as I always would and the 16 players on this tour.
"The frustration for me is that people whose dreams are being made by going on this tour aren't being mentioned.
"They are not getting any air time and it's frustrating. We've got some very, very good players. That's very exciting."
Pietersen, who scored 8,181 runs at an average of 47.28 in 104 Tests, has re-signed for Surrey and will play in the County Championship this year in an attempt to earn an England recall.
Moores added: "I understand Kevin's a huge subject, but I don't think we can be drawn into that."
Meanwhile, Cook said he is feeling "refreshed" after a "fantastic" break, two weeks after criticising the selectors for stripping him of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup.
England were eliminated in the group stages of the tournament but Cook, 30, has challenged the team to replicate the form they showed in the Test series win over India last summer.
"Spending three months at home has been fantastic," he said.
"A lot has gone on since the last win against India at The Oval where we played two outstanding Test matches to come back from 1-0 down in the series.
"To say we can get back there straightaway is a challenge but it's up to the players and the leadership of me and Peter Moores to try and do that."
England won only two of their six group games at the World Cup as they failed to reach the quarter-finals
But Moores rejected the notion that he must win in the West Indies to hold on to his job, with England set to play New Zealand in May before the Ashes series starts in July.
"It doesn't work like that," he said. "We all know we're in a results business.
"It's not about the coach. It's about the players and about winning. It's about England cricket.
"We have a very committed bunch of players, coaches and support staff who are desperate for England to win."
England, who flew out on Thursday, face a St Kitts and Nevis Invitation XI on Monday, the first of two two-day warm-up games before the opening Test in Antigua.
