[SN]TITLE[SN]
Castle Douglas clock tower could return to use

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the most prominent buildings in Castle Douglas could be set to come back into use.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clock tower has latterly been used as homeless accommodation.
However, Dumfries and Galloway Council stopped letting it in October last year because of the high cost of heating the property.
Officials are now recommending that the local Common Good Fund provides Â£9,500 to install new heating and roof insulation.
