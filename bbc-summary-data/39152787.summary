Bid for Bridgend to end twinning with European towns

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bridgend could sever all historical links with towns in Europe as a bid is launched to end its twinning scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Since 1971, the town has been partnered with Langenau, Germany, and in 1994 was paired with Villenave d'Ornon, in south west France.
But an extraordinary meeting of the town council has been called for Wednesday to consider ending all ties.
A motion calls on the council to withdraw from all twinning and friendship links.
Councillor Haydn Morgan said it would be "sad" if the town council severed its links with the towns - one having been partnered for almost half a century.
"This is not going to go down well with the public. Why are they so hell bent?" he said.
"The Welsh students learn when they go to France and the French students learn about the culture when they come over here, it is really sad," he added.
In recent years the exchange had been run by the Bridgend twinning committee, with the support of the town council.
The document, signed by four councillors, said changes in the arrangements meant there had been a "complete lack of activity" with the partnership in Langenau.
The motion reads that the town clerk should notify the towns that the decision was not a criticism of them.
If approved, it would also end Bridgend's friendship with Hechtel-Eksel in Belgium, started in 2014.
Councillors David Unwin, Clare Lewis, Diane Burns and Bob Burns who put forward the motion were asked to comment.
