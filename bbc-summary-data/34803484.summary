M4 queues ease after fire between Pencoed and Sarn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic has returned to normal on the M4 near Bridgend after a minibus fire caused queuing traffic at rush hour, Traffic Wales has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Three lanes were initially closed on the westbound carriageway just before 16:00 GMT as smoke billowed across the motorway between junction 35 at Pencoed and junction 36 at Sarn.
That was later reduced to one lane as fire crews put out the blaze while the minibus was on the hard shoulder.
All occupants got out safely.
They were assessed by paramedics as a precaution.
