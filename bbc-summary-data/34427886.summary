Critchley, 19, played six first-class matches last season, averaging 41, and he became the youngest Derbyshire player to score a century in May when he made 137 not out against Northants.
"I'm delighted to sign my first professional contract," Critchley said.
"It's been a special summer, making my debut and hitting my maiden century."
Elite performance director Graeme Welch said: "He has displayed the right character and skill to succeed at this level."
Lancashire-born Critchley was also part of the Derbyshire team that won the Second XI One-Day Trophy, taking nine wickets during the competition and averaging 48.50 with the bat.
