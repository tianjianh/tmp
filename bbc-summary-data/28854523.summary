Tests have shown rat poison killed the female bird of prey, which was discovered in a quarry in Penmaenmawr in June.
North Wales Police said this was the second suspicious death of a peregrine falcon in the last few months.
The protected bird is a threat to racing pigeons and officers are appealing to the community for help.
"It is very sad that a highly protected and rare bird is being wiped out of north Wales because someone is laying poison indiscriminately for their own gain," said Sgt Rob Taylor.
"We are aware of the reasons and methods of poisoning and also the locations of our birds, so we will be working closely with the RSPB and other voluntary societies to put a stop to this practice and catch the offender."
Last month, four peregrine falcons were found dead in their remote nest at a quarry in Gwynedd.
One adult and three chicks were discovered in the nest at Dyffryn Nantlle and police suspected foul play.
