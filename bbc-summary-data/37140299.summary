[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 1-0 Dumbarton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lee Miller's late strike against Dumbarton earned Falkirk their first win of the Championship season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luca Gasparotto saved the Bairns early on when he reacted quickly to clear David Smith's prod at goal.
When Luke Leahy headed against the crossbar in the second half for Peter Houston's men, it looked as if the breakthrough would never come.
But, in the 86th minute, Leahy crossed for Miller to slam in at the back post and snatch his side a victory.
