[SN]TITLE[SN]
David Sibbald named as Glasgow Science Centre chairman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Software entrepreneur David Sibbald has been announced as the new chairman of Glasgow Science Centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He will take over from Strathclyde University principal Sir Jim McDonald, who has stepped down after six years.
Dr Sibbald is currently the executive chairman of data analytics firm Aridhia and chairman of tech business Sumerian.
Glasgow Science Centre said it hoped the appointment would help to maximise its commercial opportunities and attract additional investment.
Chief executive Dr Stephen Breslin said: "The centre is a charity with a mission to make science accessible for everyone.
"To maintain our momentum and to keep the centre relevant in this fast-paced and commercially volatile world, we need a chair that can guide the board and provide an entrepreneurial business focus to our activities to ensure that the centre will be able to invest in its ambitious growth plans."
Dr Sibbald said: "The centre is more than just a visitor centre - it will draw people through who might otherwise be 'turned off' or 'scared' of science.
"I believe that this outstanding venue will play a key role in driving forward education around the need to attract more people into STEM subjects and engaging kids, parents and teachers is part of that."
