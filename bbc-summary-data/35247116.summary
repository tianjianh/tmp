[SN]TITLE[SN]
Holyrood committee to examine Trade Union Bill impact

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Holyrood committee is to scrutinise the potential impact of the UK government's Trade Union Bill.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The devolution (further powers) committee is to hear evidence about the bill's potential impact on industrial relations and services in Scotland.
The Scottish government and Scottish Labour have both made efforts to win permission for Holyrood to block the Westminster bill north of the border.
A chamber debate could be held on the committee's findings within the month.
The Trade Union Bill, which would make it more difficult to call strikes, has drawn criticism from across the Holyrood chamber.
SNP minister Roseanna Cunningham wrote to the presiding officer requesting a legislative consent memorandum, a special motion which could allow Holyrood to block the bill from applying in Scotland, although this was turned down by Tricia Marwick.
Scottish Labour has also weighed in, with leader Kezia Dugdale writing to the presiding officer to protest and MSP James Kelly was ejected from the chamber while challenging Ms Marwick.
The Scottish Conservatives do not oppose the bill, with MSP Murdo Fraser saying it is "clearly" a reserved matter and noting that Holyrood "should not be duplicating the work of the House of Commons".
Devolution committee convener Bruce Crawford said the bill raised "serious concerns for many members".
He said: "Given the bill is already progressing through Westminster, we urgently want to hear, on the record, what impact this legislation will have in Scotland, if it is enacted in its current form.
"We particularly want to examine its potential impact on Scottish public sector workers and their employers."
Witnesses will include representatives of the Scottish Trades Unions Congress, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and NHS Scotland.
Following the session, the committee will produce a report which could be debated by the full parliament by the end of the month.
