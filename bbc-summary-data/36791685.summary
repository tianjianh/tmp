A total of £170,000 in cash and a stun gun were seized during searches at various locations in Armagh on Wednesday.
Those detained were three men aged 31, 38 and 58, and a 56-year-old woman.
The operation began when officers "forcibly stopped" a van on the Killylea Road at about 15:00 BST.
A 38-year-old man, who was driving the van, was arrested at the scene after officers found £10,000 inside the vehicle.
During a follow-up search of a house on Salters Grange Road police seized a Mercedes S63 AMG, a BMW X5 and documents.
At about 16:30 BST, a 31-year-old man was arrested at a filling station on Cathedral Road in the city.
Officers then went to an address in Callan Crescent, where they found about £160,000 hidden in the living room.
They also found the stun gun and four "extremely high-end designer watches" at the property.
The woman and the 58-year-old man, who were in the property at the time, were  arrested.
A police spokesman said officers believed the cash and jewellery were the "proceeds of major drugs criminality".
"We believe this operation has struck a major blow to the activities of an organised gang involved in serious drugs criminality in Northern Ireland," he said.
All four are still being questioned on suspicion of drug and money laundering offences.
