Speaking to USA Today, the 21-year-old said his new material would be more mature after a few years of making the wrong sort of headlines.
"I don't want to say it's different because that's what everyone says," he said.
"But it is different, it's a grown-up version of Justin and I think people will be shocked."
The Canadian pop star said he was turning his life around, echoing comments he made at the filming of his Comedy Central Roast last month.
"My whole direction has changed," he said.
"What you are thinking about all the time is what you write, and now that I'm thinking about more positive things, it completely changes my music."
Bieber has worked with Kanye West before on the rapper's track, Yeezus.
His manager Scooter Braun tweeted news that he was working with Slayer and Jay Z producer Rick Rubin in January.
Bieber told USA Today that he had to re-record some of the music on his new album because it didn't sound right.
"[The album] was done but it didn't match up to where I am now and where my head's at," he said.
"I want to tell my story, but I also want to give people hope. I lost hope for a while, I was in a dark place, but it's about getting out of that rut.
"It's about knowing there's sunshine on the other side."
In June last year Justin Bieber said sorry after footage of him leaked using the n-word while telling a joke about the Ku Klux Klan.
He was charged with assault and dangerous driving after crashing his quad bike into a minivan near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario.
He's also serving two years probation for throwing eggs at his neighbour's house in LA.
Bieber says the lyrics on the follow-up to 2012's Believe are about growing up, life experience and faith.
"You're around some people sometimes and it might taint what you believe," he said.
"I think that's what happened with me, I lowered my beliefs."
