[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-2 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Millwall's three-game winning streak came to an end as they were held to a draw at AFC Wimbledon in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Aidan O'Brien's stunning strike from 25 yards gave the Lions an early lead, but Lyle Taylor levelled when he flicked the ball home from a corner.
Lee Gregory and Steve Morison went close for the visitors before Morison chipped James Shea shortly before half-time to restore Millwall's lead.
Tom Elliott's header early in the second half earned Wimbledon a point.
Both sides had chances to win the game, with Shea acrobatically saving the ball on the line after a Millwall corner was deflected goalwards off one of his own defenders, while Jake Reeves forced Jordan Archer into a terrific save from close range.
The draw meant Millwall missed out on moving into the play-off places, while Wimbledon remained in mid-table.
