It was a first half to forget, with neither side managing a shot on target.
As the game opened up after the break Doolan nodded the home side ahead from close range, shortly after Danny Devine had been denied with a similar chance.
Then Doolan made it two with another header, this time getting to Callum Booth's cross.
With Ross County losing at home to St Johnstone, the result moved Thistle into sixth place, five points clear of Accies in the relegation play-off spot.
With six of their seven previous meetings having ended all square, the opening exchanges indicated another tight affair in prospect. Neither side created a clear-cut chance during the first quarter of this fixture.
Hamilton goalkeeper Gary Woods dealt with a cross from the right with a powerful punch clear, while Tomas Cerny at the other end only dirtied his gloves by fielding a headed pass-back from Devine.
This was Cerny's 200th appearance in Scottish football and by coincidence it came in a fixture between the two teams with whom he acquired that total.
Having never been on the losing side in fixtures between the two, he was keen to maintain that trend.
However, his goal was threatened five minutes before the interval when Michael Devlin sent a glancing header wide of his right-hand post after connecting with a Danny Redmond corner kick from the right.
They talk about "Firhill for thrills" but that phrase was furthest from the mind after the first half. While there was plenty of endeavour, there was no end product.
Early in the second half Eamonn Brophy got his head to a Redmond cross but it flew wide of the target.
Brophy got closer with his next effort. This time he got beyond Liam Lindsay before firing in a low shot, but Cerny was alert to the danger and stretched well to turn the effort round the post.
Thistle should have opened the scoring through Lindsay when he blasted over from four yards when Woods parried a Devine header into his path.
Midway through the second half the home side made the breakthrough. Substitutes Chris Erskine and Doolan combined as the latter rose at the back post to head home the former's cross from the left.
And Thistle doubled their lead when Booth's cross was perfect for Doolan to dispatch another header beyond the reach of Woods.
Thistle have now gone 11 games unbeaten against Accies, and while Alan Archibald's men rise up to the top half of the table, the visitors are left in the thick of a relegation battle.
Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald: "It was a massive game and a massive three points. There wasn't a lot of good football on show, I think because of the size of the game and what was at stake.
"It is a boost (being in the top six). We don't harp on about it too much, I think the last time it lasted three days. I said to the lads we've nine huge games before the split, lets win the home ones and see where it takes us, we've done that today and hopefully we can build on it."
Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning: "We were probably the better team for parts of the first half. We forced Thistle into changing their shape. In the second half you can clear see we tired which was going to happen given how stretched the squad is. When you've got a squad our size and you've got seven or eight bodies out it's going to take its toll.
"It's still all to play for, it's still a tight league, but it's going to be a grind."
