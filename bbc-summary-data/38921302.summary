Cameron Chadwick, of Norley Hall, Wigan was riding a black Yamaha on Helvellyn Road when he crashed into a lamp-post shortly before 15:35 GMT on Tuesday.
The 15-year-old later died in hospital, police said.
"Cameron is our beautiful brave boy, taken from us all too suddenly... life itself will never be the same", his family said in a statement.
"The happiest, funniest, loving lad. We love you Cameron, always and forever in our hearts."
A statement from Cameron's head teacher, Paul Bousfield of Abraham Guest Academy, said the "popular and lively" student would be "sadly missed by all".
Sgt Paul Higgins, of Greater Manchester Police, said the family were "completely and utterly devastated and want to know exactly what happened".
Appealing for anyone with information to contact police, he said: "We want to give them the answers they deserve."
