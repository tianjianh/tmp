Opener Porterfield was out for 100 after striking one six and eight fours in a 116-ball innings.
Kevin O'Brien hit 69 and his wicketkeeper brother Niall 33 as Ireland were dismissed for 270 with three balls of the 50 overs remaining.
Rohan Mustafa top-scored with 43 as the UAE were all out for 185.
Spinner George Dockrell claimed three wickets with two each for Peter Chase and Andrew McBrine.
The sides meet again in another one-day game on Saturday and then Ireland travel to Greater Noida in India for nine matches against Afghanistan across three different formats.
"It is great to start the tour with a win, as the pitch was doing a bit early on," said Warwickshire batsman Porterfield.
"After losing a couple of wickets, we showed great character to rebuild, and we had a few really good partnerships in the middle.
"Kevin O'Brien did a great job for us, although we would have liked a few more runs in the last 10 overs and that would have given us a great all-round batting performance."
