[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester United moved up to ninth in League Two with a victory at Stevenage, courtesy of two late goals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors made the perfect start after Brennan Dickenson powered home a header from an Owen Garvan corner.
And it was 2-0 four minutes later, as Kurtis Guthrie scored from the penalty spot after being brought down by Stevenage goalkeeper Jamie Jones.
But Stevenage fought back with goals either side of the interval, Ben Kennedy finishing off a Steven Schumacher free-kick before Matt Godden broke clear to pick his spot and make it 2-2 on 50 minutes.
But with 10 minutes left Chris Porter stabbed the ball home from close range to put the visitors back in front.
And then in time added on, Porter found on-loan Reading midfielder Tarique Fosu-Henry who drilled the ball past a helpless Jones to seal the victory for the U's and keep them in the hunt for a play-off spot.
