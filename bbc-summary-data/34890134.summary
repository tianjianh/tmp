A 97-year-old woman has been robbed in her home in Cardiff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the woman was asleep when the suspect entered her home on Pantmawr Road, Rhiwbina, and tried to forcibly remove rings from her fingers at about 01:00 GMT on Saturday.
He then waited for her to use her chair lift to get downstairs where he demanded money.
He disconnected her telephone, meaning she had to go outside and flag down a passer-by for help.
The suspect has been described as a young white male wearing a black scarf, dark anorak and jeans.
Det Sgt Chris Grey of Cardiff CID said: "This was a shocking incident against an elderly lady in her own home.
"I would urge anyone who knows the suspect to give them up for the sake of this elderly victim who has been subjected to a terrifying ordeal."
Police have asked anyone with information to call 101.
