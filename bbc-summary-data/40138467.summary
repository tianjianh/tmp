[SN]TITLE[SN]
Review of David Gilroy's murder conviction closed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A review of the case of David Gilroy, who was convicted of murdering Suzanne Pilley in 2012, has been closed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ms Pilley, 38, disappeared on her way to work in central Edinburgh in May 2010 but her body has never been found.
Gilroy asked for his case to be considered by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission, claiming he had suffered a miscarriage of justice.
The commission said it has now completed its review and the case has been closed.
Gilroy could ask for a subsequent review of the case by the commission but only if, for example, new evidence came to light.
He was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of her murder in March 2012, but he continued to protest his innocence.
Ms Pilley, who had previously had an affair with married Gilroy, had set off on her usual journey to work in Edinburgh city centre but never arrived.
The jury in Gilroy's trial heard he was driven by jealousy, maintained a front of normality and embarked on a series of acts to cover up his crime.
He took Ms Pilley's body to a secret grave, believed to be in remote Argyll.
When Gilroy later appealed his conviction it was rejected and he failed in a bid to have his case looked at by the UK Supreme Court.
The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission announced its review of the case in January 2015.
It was set up to investigate possible miscarriages of justice. Only a small number are referred back to the High Court.
