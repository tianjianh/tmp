Rail electrification still a top priority, Cairns says

Electrifying the main rail line between south Wales and London remains a "top priority" for the UK government, according to the Welsh secretary.

Alun Cairns gave his commitment as he made a site visit to see upgrading work at the Severn Tunnel.
He also highlighted the importance of transport links to the economy in a speech to business leaders in Cardiff.
Mr Cairns said the benefits of electrification will "vastly outweigh" the six-week closure of the tunnel.
"It will be delivered," the Welsh secretary told a gathering of the Institute of Directors on Thursday.
"Our £500m contribution to the Cardiff city deal will support electrification of the Valley Lines railways," he said, referring to a £1.2bn plan to boost infrastructure across south east Wales.
"Crossrail [in London] will enhance the shorter journey times offered by electrification of the mainline - bringing Cardiff closer to Canary Wharf.
"And we're investing to link Heathrow airport to the Great Western mainline - cutting half an hour off the journey between Heathrow and south Wales."
Mr Cairns also highlighted the UK government's promise to halve tolls on the Severn Crossings when they return to public ownership in 2018.
In 2015, the then Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he hoped the main line would be electrified as far as Swansea by 2020 or 2021, after Network Rail said it would complete the London to Cardiff upgrade by March 2019.
Meanwhile the Welsh Government has named four preferred bidders in the competition to run the new not-for-profit Wales and Borders rail franchise from October 2018.
