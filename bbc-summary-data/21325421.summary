The world's first purpose-built motor racing circuit has taken a step forward to get £4.85m Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) cash for its restoration.

Brooklands Museum at Weybridge in Surrey wants to restore the finishing straight of the 1907 race circuit.
The project also aims to move and restore the Grade 2-listed Wellington Hangar, built on the track in 1940 for the assembly of Wellington bombers.
The museum has been awarded HLF funding of £286,500 to develop the project.
The charitable trust is expected to apply for the remainder of the grant in 2015.
Within a year of the race track opening, early experiments in aviation were also taking place at the site.
Motor racing ended at Brooklands on the outbreak of World War II, when the aviation factories of Vickers-Armstrong and Hawker were expanded.
The Wellington Hangar now houses numerous historic aircraft, including a Wellington bomber recovered from Loch Ness in 1985.
As part of the aircraft factory and race track revival project, the hangar will be restored on a new site next to the race track and show displays of how aircraft were designed and built at Brooklands for 80 years.
Every British and French Concorde was partly manufactured at Brooklands, and the museum now has Concorde G-BBDG on display.
"Brooklands is a unique place which is celebrated as a test bed of invention and daring for both motor racing and aviation development," said Stuart McLeod, head of Heritage Lottery South East.
"We look forward to working with them over the coming months as they develop their ideas further."
