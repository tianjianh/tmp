Will Hughes' return to action after injury feels like a new signing for Derby County head coach Darren Wassall.

Hughes was a late substitute in the 4-1 win over Bolton on Saturday, his first game since suffering knee ligament damage on the first day of the season.
The midfielder, 20, also played 90 minutes for the Rams' under-21 side in the loss against Arsenal on Monday.
"Hopefully he is over all his troubles and can play a part for the rest of the season," Wassall told BBC Radio Derby.
"We are so pleased he is back on the pitch; he has given everybody a boost.
"It's like signing a new player. We have a great squad of players, but to bring Will Hughes back into contention is great. The crowd gave him a great ovation."
Midfielder Johnny Russell was equally pleased by Hughes' return: "He is such an important player.
"You forget how young he is at times and the quality he possesses. It's been the right thing to take time with him, you don't want to lose him for any longer than we already have.
"He has been flying in training so it's great to see him back out there."
