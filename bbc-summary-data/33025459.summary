[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anthony Fuggle, ex-Colet Court teacher, sentenced over child pornography

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former teacher at a boys' preparatory school who was caught with thousands of indecent images of children has been given a suspended jail term.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Fuggle was sentenced to four months, suspended for two years, at Kingston Crown Court, south London.
Fuggle, 58, admitted six counts of possessing indecent images of children.
The ex-classics master at Colet Court, in Barnes, also admitted seven charges of making indecent images of children on or before 10 September 2013.
He was found to be in possession of more than 1,000 still and moving images of children, the court heard.
Colet Court is a junior division of St Paul's Preparatory School. Alumni include Chancellor George Osborne.
A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: "There was no evidence to suggest that any of the children in the pictures were students at St Paul's or Colet Court."
Fuggle, from Sutton, south London, is understood to have resigned from his post at the school after he was arrested in September 2013.
Investigations revealed the teacher had downloaded almost 2,000 images of children, some of whom were as young as 12.
Four counts of making images of the most severe level, Category A, were left to lie on file after he pleaded not guilty to them.
Jane Humphryes QC told the court Fuggle had been seeking help and was attending weekly therapy sessions.
Fuggle was the first person to be charged under the Metropolitan Police's Operation Winthorpe.
It was set up to investigate allegations of historical sexual abuse and misconduct at St Paul's and Colet Court.
