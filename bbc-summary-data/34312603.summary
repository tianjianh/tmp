Chris Moyles promises Radio X is 'not just for men'

Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles has returned to the airwaves on Radio X - the new name for Xfm.

He launched the Radio X breakfast show by trying to dispel the notion that the station was aimed at men, and opened with Girls Aloud's Love Machine.
Radio X originally promised to be the "first truly male-focused" station. But Moyles told listeners it was "not a radio version of a Yorkie bar".
It is the DJ's first radio job since he left Radio 1 in 2012 after 15 years.
"If you've read about Radio X being a radio station being for men only, that is rubbish," he said. "Nobody agrees with this except for the one person who put it in the press release."
Moyles did not play his first song until almost half an hour into the show, and was later joined on air by ex-Oasis star Noel Gallagher.
Some fans complained that the Radio X website was struggling to cope with the numbers of listeners trying to tune in online.
He began his Radio X debut with the words: "Hello again Great Britain. Right, this is a bit weird isn't it... Welcome to a brand new radio station.
"I've been waiting for three years for this place, sitting on my backside doing nothing, watching Judge Rinder, or whatever it's called, and now I'm back on the radio. That's right, the money finally ran out.
"And what better place for my comeback than a brand new radio station that I can play with and do whatever I want. Which isn't entirely true."
He continued: "The last time I started a breakfast show I was 29. I'm 41 now. How the hell did that happen?
"I'm Chris and I'll be your host and guide through the next week, few weeks, month, few months, and let's just leave it there and see how we get on."
The show sees Moyles go head-to-head with his successor on BBC Radio 1's breakfast show, Nick Grimshaw.
Moyles attracted eight million listeners at the peak of his Radio 1 show. Grimshaw currently attracts an audience of about 5.8 million.
Vernon Kay, Johnny Vaughan and the Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson also have their own shows on Radio X.
When it was announced that Xfm would be revamped, Radio X promised to play the "best fresh rock and guitar-based music across the UK" and be the "first truly male-focused" station, targeted at 25-44 year olds.
