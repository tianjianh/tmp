The 'useless' Facebook post

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
You may have seen friends posting it lately or even done it yourself.

In fact the message which seems to be trying to protect users' creative content has been around on Facebook for some time.
It encourages people to copy and paste the post to their own walls to try to stop the social network using their videos, illustrations, comics and photos.
But here's the thing... the message is useless.
Facebook already says in its terms and conditions that it doesn't own users' content.
It states: "You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings".
So the user's "Intellectual Property" or IP (that's the legal name given to "creations of the mind" like art or photography) is already protected by copyright laws. Those laws try to stop other people using your content.
But while users haven't given Facebook ownership of their content, the terms and conditions do state that they have handed over: "A non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook".
To translate - that means Facebook can use your content on its site without paying you, for promotional purposes.
And once you've uploaded content and made it public on there, there's not much you can do to stop the site using it.
"Copyright in content is generally owned by the person who creates it, unless you've created something as an employee and it doesn't apply to personal details.
You can only give someone else copyright (permission to use your content) in writing, and Facebook is clear in its T&Cs that when you use its site you are not doing that.
Therefore, Facebook doesn't own your content.
"However, when you create a Facebook profile you give the site a very wide, flexible, and (importantly) free licence to do pretty much what it likes with that content.
"It is probably true that Facebook would need permission to use your content outside the website, but this would be the case without this notice anyway.
"In short, this message should be ignored. To use a technical phrase, it's a load of rubbish."
Facebook's terms and conditions also say permission to use your content ends when you close your account, unless it's already been shared with other users.
So if you're worried, they only real solution is... don't post it.
