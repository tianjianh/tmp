The number of unwanted reptiles being abandoned has risen by a third in three years, according to the RSPCA.

Abandoned cases seen by the charity include a desert iguana and a pair of bearded dragons.
Keith Simpson-Wells from the RSPCA Reptile Rehoming Centre in Brighton says people don't know enough about how to keep the animals.
"People don't do their research completely on the animal before they get it and I think sometimes they can become scared of the animal," he said.
In 2011 the RSPCA collected 1,390 reptiles. By 2014 the number had increased to 1,853.
