[SN]TITLE[SN]
Housing Bill to be considered first bill under new England-only rules

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to give housing association tenants the right to buy their homes will become the first test of "English votes for English laws" when they are considered in the Commons later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ahead of the Housing Bill's second reading, Speaker John Bercow said parts of it "apply exclusively" to England and others to England and Wales only.
Under new rules, English and Welsh MPs have been given a veto in these areas.
The SNP has said the move makes Scottish MPs "second-class citizens".
Right-to-buy is being outlawed in Scotland and is not an issue the SNP would normally have voted on - but the SNP is furious about the move.
They have promised to act responsibly when deciding when to challenge the application of the new rules - but sources say they will create "mischief" when the opportunity arises.
The Housing Bill could provide their first opportunity - particularly if it is found to contain financial implications for Scotland.
It is the first bill that has been designated as containing proposals that affect only England and Wales under the new English votes for English laws standing orders.
During the bill's passage through Parliament, there will now be a new stage added to the usual law-making process at Westminster allowing MPs for English constituencies to vote on issues deemed to only affect England.
If the bill is approved at second reading, it will move on to detailed scrutiny by a committee made up only of MPs representing English constituencies. They will make changes and recommend others which will be considered later by all MPs at report stage.
After this, the bill will be scrutinised by a Grand Committee of English MPs which will be asked to give its consent to the relevant clauses. Those clauses which are rejected will be reconsidered by all MPs before being subject to English-only scrutiny again, at which point any disputed clauses will fall.
Any amendments later made by the House of Lords will be subject to "double majority" approval by all MPs and by English/Welsh MPs.
Plans to extend right-to-buy to housing association tenants, first announced by the Conservatives during the election campaign, were altered last month to make them voluntary rather than mandatory.
The government has agreed to compensate housing associations for the sales discount offered to the tenant and housing associations would retain the sales receipt to enable them to reinvest in the delivery of new homes.
As well right-to-buy, the bill:
