The tourists started the day at 40-0 but lost David Warner and skipper Steve Smith as India attempted to fight back after a first-innings total of 189.
But Marsh (66) and Matthew Renshaw (60) frustrated the hosts as they had a partnership of 52.
Marsh also put on 57 with Matthew Wade, who was unbeaten on 25 as Australia reached 237-6 at the close of play.
On a difficult pitch to score runs, resilient Renshaw was at the crease for four hours 22 minutes and faced 196 balls for his innings.
Fellow left-hander Marsh took three hours and 49 minutes to get to 66 as he faced 197 balls.
Renshaw was dropped by Virat Kohli on 29, while Marsh got a reprieve when India chose not to review a not out decision when he edged paceman Umesh Yadav to wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha on 14.
Australia lead the series 1-0 after winning the opening Test of the four-match series.
