Defender Jonas Olsson says he is not too concerned about his lack of first-team football at West Bromwich Albion.

The 33-year-old Swede made his first Premier League appearance since 20 August in the Baggies' 2-1 defeat by Liverpool in place of the suspended Jonny Evans.
But with Evans available for Saturday's visit of Manchester City, Olsson is set to return to the bench.
"I just have to try my best when called upon," Olsson told BBC WM 95.6.
Olsson's only action before playing at Anfield was in West Brom's EFL Cup tie at Northampton Town on 23 August and their Under-23 side's Checkatrade Trophy defeat by Luton Town on 4 October.
But he was happy to slot in alongside Gareth McAuley again at the heart of the defence for his top-flight return.
"It's nice to play with Gareth. We've been playing together for a while so we know each other," Olsson said.
"Obviously he's been playing with Jonny, who's been doing really well since he came from Manchester United.
"It's tough competition for me  - I've been out of the team for a good month and a half. But I just have to train well - hopefully me and Gareth have a few more games left in us."
