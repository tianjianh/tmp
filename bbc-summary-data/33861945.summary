A £28m art gallery plagued by falling visitor numbers is considering displaying world-famous art to boost attendance.

Firstsite gallery in Colchester, Essex, is set to lose £500,000 this financial year despite two injections of funding.
Interim director Anthony Roberts admitted the gallery "hadn't really found its voice" since opening in 2011.
Among ideas being considered to draw in crowds are plans to display works such as Rodin's The Kiss.
Firstsite was one of two projects across England to be placed under a special funding agreement by Arts Council England earlier this year.
Managers must show an improvement in visitor numbers or face losing funding altogether.
"It's a big challenge," Mr Roberts said. "Despite the really hard work, it hasn't really managed to connect. And no-one's particularly to blame for that - it's a misfiring of energy and work."
But he said, since he had taken on the interim post in April, visitor numbers had increased by 25% between May and June.
'The Golden Banana'
Documents obtained by BBC Essex using a Freedom of Information request show since 2009, the East of England has received the lowest amount of Arts Council funding of anywhere in England.
The documents also revealed ideas considered during an emergency planning workshop to make the gallery more appealing.
Changing the gallery's name was mooted as a possibility, but Mr Roberts said he personally had "very warm feelings" towards its current moniker.
"I'm working my very hardest to rattle the turnstiles, to bring people in, to put a smile on people's faces, to make Colchester proud and happy and comfortable in this beautiful international building," he said.
