[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 0-1 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere missed the chance to keep up the pace with National League leaders Lincoln as Kaiyne Woolery's late goal handed third-placed Forest Green a 1-0 win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Woolery kept his cool to slot past goalkeeper Scott Davies in the 85th minute to end Tranmere's six-match winning run and leave them three points behind the Imps.
Tranmere, who beat Solihull Moors 9-0 at the weekend, struggled with their finishing this time around as Connor Jennings and James Norwood missed decent opportunities.
Adam Buxton was also denied, his 25-yard free-kick hitting the crossbar in the 30th minute, and Forest Green made them pay as Woolery struck the winner late on.
