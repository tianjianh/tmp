Manager Darrell Clarke told said: "I've told Mark McChrystal, Will Puddy, Liam Lawrence, Jermaine Easter, Tyler Lyttle and Jay Malpas they will no longer be considered for first-team selection."
Defender McChrystal, 32, and goalkeeper Puddy, 29, both started Saturday's loss at Fleetwood, while striker Easter, 35, was a second-half substitute.
Midfielder Lawrence, 35, was also on the bench for the same league game.
Clarke added: "It was a tough decision to make, but by making it now it gives these players, who remain under contract with Bristol Rovers, the opportunity to find themselves a new club."
