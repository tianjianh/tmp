Second seed Federer was close to his imperious best, employing his full range of shots to dissect his flummoxed opponent as he won 6-2 6-2 6-3.
The Swiss will next face Gilles Simon for a place in the semi-finals.
He needs one more title to break the record he holds with Pete Sampras and Willie Renshaw.
"I don't think I made a statement," said Federer. "I did a nice job making the transition.
"It was a good match. I got off to a good start and kept rolling. Obviously maybe Roberto wasn't at his very best."
Federer broke his Spanish opponent in the fifth game of the first set and again in the seventh to win it in 19 minutes.
The 33-year-old broke again in the first game of the second set before Bautista Agut called for the trainer, having hurt his ankle sliding beyond the baseline.
Federer then attacked the Spaniard's serve early in the third to close the contest in one hour 26 minutes and move closer to a possible semi-final meeting with Andy Murray.
Federer beat the British number one in the 2012 final to win the last of those seven titles, and another potential showdown is an alluring prospect on a court that has seen the best of both men.
