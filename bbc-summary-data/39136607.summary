Newport County boss Graham Westley says he is not bothered by fan abuse after he was greeted by angry supporters after their last League Two defeat.

The Exiles' 2-1 loss at Mansfield and midweek results going against them means the Exiles are now nine points adrift of safety in League Two.
"No I wasn't bothered, I've had fans berate me at games, I have had fans coin me at games, I have had square ups with fans at different clubs," he said.
"As manager, it's my job to take flak."
"Passion is a part of football. I let people say what they want to say and if they think I am to blame... they can say so."
The Exiles face Leyton Orient, the side directly above them, at Rodney Parade on Saturday and Westley says a positive result would be just the start.
"We know that to stay up, we probably need 24, 25, 26 points out of a possible 39," he told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"That work needs doing. We know the job and we have been getting ourselves ready since January.
"A club like Newport always has limited choice, but I think we've got some key players in... and a lot of them are returning.
"We have a squad that I think can wins games and we should only get better.
"I honestly believe these lads can help us secure our League Two status."
