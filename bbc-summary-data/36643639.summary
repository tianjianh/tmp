[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Partick Thistle will continue to press for compensation after accepting that a fixture list they claim damages the club financially cannot be altered.

The Premiership fixtures for the coming season gave Thistle, Motherwell and Hamilton Academical fewer guaranteed games against Celtic and Rangers.
Thistle will meet the Scottish Professional Football League this week.
"As fixtures can't be changed, the question of compensation remains live for clubs affected," said Thistle.
"We look forward to a positive and robust exchange of views on this matter at the meeting.
"We are also in touch with the other clubs in the league and will be arranging to meet them at a separate time."
Thistle and Motherwell had both expressed anger that they would only have one home game against both Celtic and Rangers before the Premiership splits into two for the final five fixtures.
Dundee, Hearts and Inverness Caledonian Thistle will have two home games against both the Glasgow clubs.
Thistle and Motherwell have complained that it not only left the financially disadvantaged because of the Old Firm's travelling support but would hamper their search for league points.
"Reluctantly, we accept that there will be a sporting disadvantage in the coming season," Thistle said in a website statement.
"However, we will press the SPFL to show how it intends to avoid this recurring in future.
"Contrary to press reports suggesting the SPFL has already decided there will be no compensation or fixtures changed, Thistle has secured a meeting with the SPFL this week to discuss the situation in more detail.
"The board hopes that, despite media comment suggesting otherwise, the SPFL would not have agreed to a meeting if minds have already been made up on this important matter."
