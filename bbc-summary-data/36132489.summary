Ding led 10-6 going into Monday's final session and held off a late comeback by the Englishman to win three of the seven frames played and secure victory.
The Chinese player will face Welshman Mark Williams in the last eight.
England's Kyren Wilson beat Mark Allen of Northern Ireland 13-9, having begun the session with an 11-5 lead.
To tweet or not to tweet?
The closest Trump came to Ding was when he scored his only century of the match to get back to 2-2 in the opening session.
At the mid-session interval, Trump responded to a critical tweet by beaten qualifier Dominic Dale by calling him "clueless" after Dale had said his cue ball control was not as good as his opponent's.
But Trump, who scored two half-tons in his three-frame run to get back to 12-10, refused to blame his social media activities for his defeat: "It had nothing to do with it. It was because Ding was the better player.
"It worked when I did it against Liang Wenbo [Trump's first-round win]. People just like to pick faults."
'I don't feel a lot of pressure' - Ding
Ding took a seemingly unassailable 12-7 lead thanks to a break of 91, but Trump made him work for the win by reeling off three frames in a row.
The Bristol-based player had his chances at 12-10 as well but could not convert, and Ding finally got across the finish line to reach the quarter-finals for the fourth time.
"I feel good," said Ding, who had to come through qualifying after dropping out of the world's top 16.
"When I feel well I don't feel a lot of pressure.
"Judd is a great player. I had a very good start at 6-2 up and after that I tried to hold on and win every session, or if not hold it at 4-4."
Wilson wins 'crazy, crazy match'
Kettering qualifier Wilson, ranked 19th, overcame some late jitters to see off world number seven Allen and set up a quarter-final against 2014 world champion Mark Selby.
Allen won four in a row thanks to some sensational long-potting and break-building as he cut the deficit to 11-9.
But Wilson, making just his second Crucible appearance, showed he has the temperament to equal his talent by winning a scrappy penultimate frame before sealing victory with a fine 71 under intense pressure.
"It was the strangest game I have ever played," said the 24-year-old.
"To go 7-0 up, lose five on the bounce, win five on the bounce and then lose four on the bounce - it was a crazy, crazy match.
"But I think I showed a lot of mental strength. It is something I have learned - to fall back on my routine. My coach Barry Stark got me right at the intervals.
"There are only eight players left in the tournament. I am still here to win it. I will be well up for playing Mark."
