In July it emerged the secretary of state had not "called in" the ambitious scheme which included a 10,000-capacity stadium near Glasshoughton.
Wakefield Council had already approved the plan, but on Monday evening the period for any judicial review expired.
Wakefield Council leader Peter Box said it was "a great day for the town".
Developers Lateral Property Group said the scheme could create 2,000 jobs.
Plans for the so-called Five Towns Park include a 50-acre country park, shops and restaurants.
Mr Box said: "It's not just a great day for Castleford Tigers, but a great day for the town of Castleford.
"It's going to help with the regeneration of the town, it's also going to create new jobs and opportunities for local people, so all in all it's a red letter day."
Phillip Lunn, managing director of Lateral Property Group said: ''We are pleased to confirm that we have now formally received planning permission from Wakefield Council and that the period for any possible legal challenge has now passed.
"This means that we have now taken another major step towards making Five Towns Park a reality.
"This development would not be possible without the continued support of the local community, for which we are very grateful."
Tigers' head coach Daryl Powell said: "It's outstanding news to get the next step towards our new stadium."
