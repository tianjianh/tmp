The attack on the 11-year-old, of Stockport, Greater Manchester is said to have happened at Scoutcentrum Buitenzorg camp in Baarn, Utrecht, in the summer of 1985.
The victim only reported it to Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in March 2016.
Detectives want anyone who may have been at the camp from mid-July to the end of August 1985 to contact them.
Det Con Phil Hargreaves said: "We have followed extensive inquiries and we now want to speak to anyone who was at the camp that summer.
"Even if you didn't witness anything, or have any knowledge of the incident, you may still have information which could be vital to this investigation."
He added: "We know scout groups from across the UK and Europe visited the camp, so it may be that you are not from the Greater Manchester area but I would still urge you to get in touch."
