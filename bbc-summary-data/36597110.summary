Willis, 25, won 7-5 6-4 against teenager Rublev, the world number 203.
The Slough-born British number 23 will now take on Daniil Medvedev, who was disqualified from a tournament in April for comments to an umpire.
Fellow Britons Harriet Dart and Edward Corrie are also one win away from the main draw.
Dart, the 19-year-old world number 448 and British number 11, beat Japanese 10th seed Risa Ozaki 6-4 6-3 and will take on Russia's Ekaterina Alexandrova on Thursday.
Corrie, the world number 358, is also still in contention after knocking out 10th seed Michael Berrer, but Gabriella Taylor, Joe Salisbury, Daniel Cox, Katie Boulder, Lisa Whybourn and Freya Christie all saw their singles campaigns ended.
