Leicester City's Danny Simpson wins curfew appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leicester City star Danny Simpson has won an appeal against a curfew that would have prevented him joining events to mark his club's Premier League win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The curfew had been imposed on Thursday, after a community sentence - given to Simpson for assaulting the mother of his child - was revoked.
The 29-year-old complained that "press intrusion" was stopping him completing the 300 hours of unpaid work.
A judge has now lifted the curfew - but restored the community order.
The player denied attempting to strangle his ex-partner but was convicted last May and ordered to complete 300 hours in unpaid work.
Judge Richard Mansell QC at Manchester Crown Court overturned the decision and ruled Simpson must now complete the unpaid work after all.
On Thursday his lawyer had complained journalists had found where he was carrying out his community service, making it impossible.
Judge Mansell said: "He's hardly keeping a low profile, turning up for unpaid work in a Lamborghini. Why can't he get a cab?"
He said he "did not buy" Simpson could not do his unpaid work elsewhere - other footballers had done it.
The judge, sitting with two magistrates, told Simpson he can complete the rest of his 300 hours once his club commitments diminish over the summer.
Judge Mansell added: "We are back to square one, and it's cost the appellant a significant amount of money."
On Thursday District Judge Alexandra Simmonds, at Manchester Magistrates' Court had said Simpson must wear an electronic tag and stay indoors at his home in Salford between 22:00 and 06:00 for the next 21 days,
The former Manchester United player, who also played for Newcastle and QPR, was arrested on 29 December after a reports of a row at a house in Worsley, Greater Manchester.
