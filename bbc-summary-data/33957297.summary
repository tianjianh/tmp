Stuart Calder, 52, was on a break with his wife Clare, two of their four children and other relatives at their holiday home near Newquay, Cornwall.
Mr Calder drowned while attempting to save his sons Hugo and Milo and two other teenagers in severe conditions.
Rachel Dunn, 42, and her fiancÃ© Kevin Reynolds, 44, also died.
In a written statement Hugo Calder described how the tragedy unfolded on October 26 at Mawgan Porth, saying when he entered the water, he was not aware of any warning signs.
"I surfed with my brother Milo for about 20 minutes with nothing out of the ordinary happening," the experienced surfer, who is on a gap year before university, said.
"I became aware of a girl aged about 15 asking me to help her because she had difficulty getting back to the shore. I was able to hold her and I got her to the shallow water and she walked to the shore."
The teenager said he then saw his brother helping Gethin Robson and his sibling was waving at him to help William Robson, who was also in trouble.
"There were waves crashing in on this boy and he also seemed to be signalling to me. I moved towards him on my board and as I got near him I could hear him shouting for help," he said.
"I managed to get to him without too much difficulty. He grabbed my board and we started to try and head towards the shore."
Mr Calder said that he then saw Kevin Reynolds struggling in the water and he too grabbed the surf board - making it even harder to paddle to the shore.
"I then saw my dad and he was trying to swim towards me. He was fighting the waves and looked panicky and was shouting for help," he said.
"I left the two other people holding onto my board and swam towards him. I reached him and we both managed to get back to my board.
"There were now four of us holding onto the board. We tried to swim back to the shore but we were getting thrown around and hit by the waves and the board was sinking a bit.
"We caught up with Milo and I moved over to his board so there would be three on each. I looked back to see where my dad was and could see all three had fallen off.
"All of a sudden my board flew past with no one on it. I felt something terrible had happened.
"The next thing I remember was that my dad's lifeless body was near to me in the water. I tried to get hold of the body and get him onto Milo's board but he kept falling off.
"The current was too strong and the waves meant I couldn't keep hold of my dad. We had to leave him in order to get back to the shore."
The incident happened during October half term when there was no lifeguard cover.
Some experienced surfers told the hearing that the sea current was too strong that day and the water should have been closed off.
Cornwall Coroner Emma Carlyon recorded separate conclusions of accidental death and said having heard evidence from the Coastguard that rip currents are common she would not make a report to prevent future deaths.
