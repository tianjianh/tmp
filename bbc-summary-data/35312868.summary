The Met Office has issued yellow "be aware" warnings for further snow in north and west Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and south-west England on Friday.
Ice is also expected to affect parts of the country, including north-east England.
Below is a selection of images from areas which have already experienced a frosty sprinkling of snow.
The well-known Angel of the North took on a paler hue in Gateshead, in Tyne and Wear.
Motorists faced disruption as snow fell on major routes across England, including on the A1 near Newcastle.
These sheep settled into the cold snap of weather in the hills of Abington, Scotland.
Important checks for damage were made by air on the train line to Fort William, Scotland.
The snow did not stop some - like this rider dashing through the snow on their horse in Middleham, Yorkshire.
And this surfer was not put off by icy temperatures as he made his way to the beach to ride the waves at Portrush in Antrim, Northern Ireland.
Meanwhile, one dog had plenty of fun running through the snowy fields of Bath.
Other rural areas hit by snow overnight included Swaledale, North Yorkshire.
Frosty conditions meant a snow plough had to clear the road for motorists in Tyndrum, Scotland.
The Peak District was also covered by the white stuff, as this gate in Buxton shows.
