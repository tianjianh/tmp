A Nicaraguan man who was scheduled to be executed on Wednesday has been given a reprieve.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bernardo Tercero was sentenced to death in 2000 for the 1997 murder of a school teacher in Texas.
A Texas court ruled on Tuesday that the execution be postponed until an appeal is resolved.
Lawyers for Tercero said that a witness for the prosecution had come forward to say she gave false testimony. A court will now review the claim.
Tercero, 39, was found guilty of shooting dead 38-year-old teacher Robert Berger in Houston, Texas.
Mr Berger was in a dry cleaning shop when Tercero came in to rob it and shot the teacher dead in front of his three-year old daughter.
Tercero said that the gun had gone off accidentally as he struggled with Mr Berger, who tried to thwart the robbery.
But an acquaintance of Tercero's told the court that he had given her various reasons for killing Mr Berger, including that he had seen his face and would be able to identify him.
Tercero denied saying this.
According to Tercero's lawyers the witness has signed a sworn statement saying that part of her evidence was false.
They argue that Tercero was denied his rights to a fair trial and due process when the prosecution unknowingly used the false testimony to secure his conviction.
They also say that he was denied his right to speak to the Nicaraguan consulate after his arrest.
Tercero has been on death row in Texas for the past 15 years.
He was scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Wednesday at 23:00 GMT.
Nicaraguan Cardinal Leopoldo Brenes wrote to Texas Governor Greg Abbott asking for clemency for Tercero.
A spokesman for the governor said that "when anyone commits a crime in Texas, they are subject to Texas law".
Ten people have been executed in Texas so far this year.
