Pop star Olly Murs has beaten Emeli Sande to the top of the album charts with his latest release, 24 Hrs.

It is the X Factor star's fourth number one album, with only his self-titled debut having missed the top spot.
Murs sold 58,000 copies of the record to oust his friend Robbie Williams from the chart summit.
The singer said he was "so excited and happy" about topping the chart, adding that the album was the "most personal" he had ever made.
He added: "It's an amazing achievement for me to have had four number one albums in a row, so thanks to my fans for continuing to support me!"
The success of the record is all the more remarkable as Murs failed to score a major hit with its first two singles.
You Don't Know Love, released in July, peaked at number 15 while the follow-up, Grow Up, failed to make the top 40 until this week, jumping from 61 to 25.
Murs's tally of four number one albums means he now ties with One Direction as the most successful X Factor act on the album chart.
Sande's long-awaited second album, Long Live the Angels, enters the chart at two while Cliff Richard's latest release, Just Fabulous Rock N Roll, debuts at four.
Leonard Cohen's final album, You Want It Darker, climbed 22 places to number seven after news of his death broke last Friday.
His best of collection, The Essential Leonard Cohen, also re-enters the chart at 26.
Nathan Sykes' debut album Unfinished Business lands at Number 11, just above a new David Bowie compilation, Legacy, at 13.
Sting's new album, 57th & 9th, finishes at a surprisingly low 15, while a surprise new release by rap legends A Tribe Called Quest, called We Got It from Here, enters at 28.
In the singles chart, Clean Bandit score a second week at number one with Rockabye, a dancehall song about a single mother struggling to support her baby.
The song could easily be toppled from the top spot next week by the hip-hop track Black Beatles, performed by the improbably-named duo Rae Sremmurd (Ear Drummers spelled backwards).
Currently at number one in the US, the track has received a big boost from its usage in the viral mannequin challenge videos - in which fans and celebrities "freeze" on the spot, taking on the appearance of shop window dummies.
One of the original Beatles, Sir Paul McCartney, has even joined the phenomenon, posting a video to Twitter on 10 November with the text: "Love those Black Beatles."
The song jumps from 36 to four on this week's countdown.
Elsewhere, Williams bags his first top 40 single in three years with Love My Life, up 24 places to 28. On Hold, the comeback single from The xx, enters the chart at 38.
