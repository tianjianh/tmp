[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Best Solution, ridden by Pat Cosgrave, was a convincing winner of the Epsom Derby Trial at Lingfield.

The Godolphin colt, at odds of 7-1, beat Glencadam Glory by three and a quarter lengths, with Tartini third.
Sofia Rocks set the pace before Best Solution surged clear. Favourite Sir John Lavery trailed home in sixth.
"We went a good gallop and didn't mess about," said Cosgrave. "I couldn't fault him. I thought it was a good performance with a penalty."
Best Solution was cut to fifth favourite with some bookmakers for the Derby, which takes place on Saturday, 3 June.

Thank goodness we've still got a potentially most informative Dante Stakes to come as the big-race picture seems to me 8/10 in terms of confused.
Best Solution put in a very solid performance here, and he'll probably go to Epsom, but the pretty comprehensive defeat of Sir John Lavery, rated prominently amongst Aidan O'Brien's Derby hopefuls was disappointing.
At Chester, O'Brien's trial winners Venice Beach and Cliffs Of Mower hardly had us reaching for the Basildon Bond to write home, and it's unclear if he'll run Churchill.
A commanding win by, say, Cracksman, with Frankie Dettori riding, in the Dante would set the Derby reckoning alight.
