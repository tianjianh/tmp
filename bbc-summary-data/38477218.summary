Maro Itoje, James Haskell, Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell return after missing the autumn internationals through injury, while there is a first call-up for Bath prop Nathan Catt.
Mako and Billy Vunipola miss the camp because of injury, while Joe Launchbury is also not fit.
Head coach Eddie Jones will confirm his Six Nations squad on 20 January.
"This short two-day camp in Brighton allows us to do some of the organisational work we need to do for the Six Nations," said Jones.
Leicester centre Tuilagi, 25, has been beset by injuries in the last couple of years and only recently returned to action after two months out with a groin problem.
