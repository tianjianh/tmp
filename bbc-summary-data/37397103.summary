Cardiff suffered a fourth straight Championship loss for the first time since 2007 when they were beaten at home by Leeds on Saturday.
With the Bluebirds bottom of the table, Trollope is urging patience.
"I've received good support from the owner, chairman [Mehmet Dalman] and chief executive [Ken Choo]," he said.
"They know what we're trying to build and create.
"Of course there's a need for short-term results, we don't want to be in the league position we're in because it hurts.
"Patience is key, especially in the modern game, because everyone wants short-term results, I certainly do.
"It hurts me that we're not getting them."
The defeat by Leeds was Trollope's eighth league game in charge of Cardiff, having succeeded Russell Slade at the end of last 2015-16.
Even at this early stage of the campaign, however, the future of the former Bristol Rovers boss has been the subject of scrutiny.

"The results are nowhere near acceptable, that's my responsibility, I know that," said Trollope.
"It's my responsibility to shape it and mould it and get the best out of people.
"I'm totally aware of that, but I also believe in how we work, that this will turn."
Leeds secured victory with an assured second-half display, though their opening goal came against the run of play after Cardiff had controlled the game before the interval.
The visitors were awarded a penalty when Bluebirds defender Matt Connolly tangled with Pontus Jansson at a corner and wrestled him to the ground.
Leeds manager Garry Monk said it was a "definite penalty" but, having seen players grapple each other from set-pieces throughout the game, Trollope felt the decision from referee Graham Scott was inconsistent.
"Probably the refereeing decision changed the game, which was frustrating for us because there was a lot going on at set-pieces at both ends," he said.
"There was a warning before. Listen, I'm not saying it wasn't a penalty, but if he's giving it then he could be giving a few at either end.
"That moment changed the game and meant we had to chase it in a different manner, we left ourselves a wee-bit open."
