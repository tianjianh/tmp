Footballer Guillermo Bauza gets medical genetics degree

What can professional footballers do after their time in the game is over?

They could become a coach, a TV pundit or do something different like run a pub or even train to become a medical geneticist?
The latter is exactly what former Swansea City striker Guillermo Bauza has done.
The Spaniard graduated with a first class honours degree from Swansea University's College of Medicine on Monday.
"Growing up I'd always wanted to be a doctor, but life changes and football came along," said Mallorca-born Bauza, who was known as Guillem in his Swansea days.
"I realised when I came to Swansea that learning English would be vital if I was going to be able to fit in and enjoy the culture here.
"The PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) were very helpful with getting me over the language barrier and they talked a lot to me about my options after football.
"So I was delighted when I got accepted by Swansea University and had the chance to swap one dream for another."
Best remembered by Swansea fans for his two goals against Gillingham which saw his side promoted to the Championship in 2008, the 30-year-old former Spain under-19 international signed up for his degree after he was released by the Swans in 2010.
Initially he combined his studies with playing professionally for Hereford United, Northampton Town and Exeter City.
But since 2013 he has studied full time while continuing to play as an amateur for Merthyr Town in the Southern Premier Division.
Now he is hoping to go on to earn his PhD.
"I could join the medicine degree and become a doctor, but since starting my course I've become really interested in the research side and would love to do my PhD at Swansea.
"I realise that the thing I miss most about being a professional footballer is the ability to make people happy.
"Hopefully I can go on to make breakthroughs which can help us better understand genetic conditions and make people happy once again."
While Bauza picks up his degree, former Swansea and Wales star Mel Nurse will receive an honorary master of science degree from the College of Human and Health Sciences.
Other honorary degrees from the university go to BAFTA-winning Welsh actor and musician Rhys Ifans (doctor of letters), Chief Medical Officer for Wales, Dr Ruth Hussey (doctor of science) and former Plaid Cymru leader Ieuan Wyn Jones (doctor of laws).
