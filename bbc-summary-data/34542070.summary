Jayne Hickey and her son Christian were shot when two men knocked on their front door in Gillingham Road, Salford on Monday evening.
Ms Hickey said her injuries meant she had not been able to care for her son.
Christian had surgery to remove a bullet on Wednesday, which has been passed to police for examination.
Police have linked the shooting to armed feuds between gangs.
Speaking about the moment her son was shot in the left leg, Ms Hickey said she "saw blood pouring from Christian".
"I screamed for his dad to put pressure on him. I knew he had been shot and I couldn't help him. I collapsed."
She said her son was "an athletic sporty boy [who] loves life", adding that he was "a very popular boy with pupils in his class".
Greater Manchester Police has issued descriptions of the two men responsible: the first is around 19 or 20 years old, of a "chunky" build and with a local accent, the second man is only described as white.
Both men are believed to have been wearing baseball caps.
Appealing to "all the mothers, grandmothers, aunties and sisters of children in Salford" to help find the men, Assistant Chief Constable Rebekah Sutcliffe said the shooting would be "etched on Christian's memory forever".
"If your little boy was shot, you would want answers and we are asking you to be brave and break your silence for the sake of all the other children in Salford who are now at risk," she said.
