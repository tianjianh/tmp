"To be honest with you, there's no way that I conceived of a Sister Martina of the Blessed Sacrament."

Martina Purdy's decision to quit her job as one of BBC Northern Ireland's best known journalists and become a nun was a shock to many people last year.
Now, over a year on, she has returned briefly to the BBC to speak about her vocation and her new way of life.
She told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme that her transformation still seems a bit strange, even to herself.
"If I'm going up the stairs in the convent, I catch my shadow - the shadow of a nun - and that kind of sometimes surprises me," she said.
Sr Martina's Talkback interview is one of a series of special in-depth conversations with well-known faces set to be broadcast over the Christmas holidays.
Presenter William Crawley recounts how his former colleague was born in west Belfast and brought up in Canada, before returning to her native Northern Ireland in her mid-20s to work as a journalist.
She spent 25 years in her chosen profession, 15 of them with the BBC in Belfast, where she held a high-profile position as a political correspondent.
But, after years of asking tough questions of those in authority, she began to question her own way of life and sought answers from a higher power.
"Journalism is a very noble profession," she said.
"You have to go after the truth, but that causes some pain for some people and I didn't have the heart for that any more.
"I had felt, I suppose, that I wanted to pray for them more than I wanted to question them, and I knew I couldn't keep going."
"I was thinking maybe I would quit my job in a couple of years, get sorted and go and maybe work in Africa as an aid worker," she told the programme.
A self-proclaimed "chatterbox", she admitted that she has been described as an "Ã  la carte Catholic" and had envisioned foreign aid work as a glamorous role.
So her decision to enter a west Belfast convent, where her order are expected to spend most of their day in silence, was all the more unexpected.
She gave up all her possessions, including her house and car, to join the Adoration Sisters on the Falls Road.
Sr Martina explained that her vocation was a "slow burn" that began about eight years ago when she visited a church during a holiday to Peru.
"I just got a sense that my life was going to change," she said.
"I got a sense that my life was a little too easy and a little bit too materialistic and that I wanted to do something to help the poor.
"I didn't do it right away - I spent a lot of time shopping in Lima and going to nice restaurants.
"But over the next few years I started praying more and then I started to do some charity work."
Her increasingly frequent visits to Belfast churches, coupled with a growing disillusionment with her day-job and lifestyle, led her to seek a different path.
She has previously described her physical transformation into a nun as a "makeover in reverse" but told Talkback it has been a liberating experience.
"I used to joke that my mascara would have to be wrenched from my cold, dead fingers, so I think that was the last of the makeup to go.
"It's a lot easier, I have to say. It's very freeing, absolutely. It's just great to just not worry about it anymore."
Other convent rules are harder to bear, with family phone calls restricted to Sundays, and friends' visits restricted to just one hour a month.
However, she said she feels she is "still in the communications business" because she looks after the convent's journal and archives, and tweets lines of scripture every day.
Her order has also asked her to give public speeches about her calling.
"Every time I turn around someone is giving me a microphone, because we are being asked to go out to schools and to give vocations talks," she said.
"There is a spiritual famine out there, people want to know.
"Even people who have no faith are kind of fascinated, like: 'Why would you do that? There must be something wrong with you.'
"But they still want to hear the story and it gives them joy."
Sr Martina's interview on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback is available to hear again on the BBC Radio iPlayer.
