[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Moyle electricity interconnector between Northern Ireland and Scotland has suffered a new fault, its operator has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mutual Energy said a cable fault was detected on Saturday.
As a result one of a pair of underwater cables has been disconnected, reducing the interconnector's capacity from 450MW to 250MW.
The interconnector suffered a long running problem between 2010 and 2016.
It was only fixed by laying a new underwater cable.
Mutual Energy said it is not yet clear if the latest problem is as a result of the cable being damaged on the seabed following some kind of strike or if there is some other reason for the fault.
Further investigation is continuing in order to pinpoint the precise location of the fault and to establish the cause of the problem.
The interconnector began operating in 2002.
It ensures cheaper electricity and security of supply between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.
