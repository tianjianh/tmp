[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premier League: Race for the Champions League and the Golden Boot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal will compete for England's final two Champions League places as the Premier League season finishes on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City will secure third spot by winning at Watford, while Liverpool will be guaranteed at least fourth by beating Middlesbrough.
But Arsenal can sneak into the top four if one of their rivals slip up and they beat Everton at the Emirates.
All 20 teams are in action, with every match kicking off at 15:00 BST.
So what are the big issues on the final day - and what is the latest team news?
Manchester City need a point at Watford to guarantee a top-four finish - but winning and finishing third will take them straight into next season's Champions League group stages.
The team in fourth place will go into a two-legged play-off in August, while whoever finishes fifth will receive a place in the Europa League.
With just six points separating Southampton, in eighth, and 16th-placed Watford, several teams also have the opportunity to improve their league position - and increase their share of Premier League prize money.
Burnley, for instance, could finish as low as 17th, earning £7.6m in prize money, or as high as 11th, which would be worth £19m - a difference of £11.4m.
Harry Kane looks set to win the Premier League Golden Boot, awarded to the competition's leading scorer, thanks to his four goals in Tottenham's 6-1 victory at Leicester on Thursday.
Spurs go to relegated Hull on Sunday with Kane on 26 league goals for the season, two clear of Everton's Romelu Lukaku.
Belgium striker Lukaku and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, third in the standings on 23 goals, will face each other at Emirates Stadium as they look to catch Kane.
No team has ever won 30 league matches in a 38-game top-flight season - but Chelsea will be the first to do so if they beat bottom club Sunderland at Stamford Bridge.
Antonio Conte's side secured the Premier League title - the club's fifth in 13 seasons - with a 1-0 victory at West Brom on 12 May, and will receive the trophy after Sunday's game.
Chelsea managed 29 league wins in a season, in 2004-05 and 2005-06, twice under Jose Mourinho.
Only two teams in the history of the English top division have achieved more - Tottenham won 31 games in 1960-61 and Liverpool 30 in 1978-79 - and they both did it in 42-match seasons.
Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Hull are all leaving the Premier League after finishing in the bottom three, but there will be individual farewells too.
Chelsea captain John Terry is set to end his 22-year stay at Stamford Bridge by playing his 717th game for the club.
At Watford, manager Walter Mazzarri will take charge for the final time, with his departure having been confirmed on Wednesday.
A number of other players may yet be turning out for their clubs for the final time, with the futures of Wayne Rooney, Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson among those in doubt.
One question that will not be answered tomorrow concerns the future of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger - who is out of contract this summer.
Asked on Friday if he would extend his 21-year reign, Wenger said only that his future would be decided at a board meeting to follow the FA Cup final against Chelsea on 27 May.
All games kick-off at 15:00 BST on Sunday
