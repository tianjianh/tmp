Two heritage projects in Gloucester have been given millions of pounds to help plans for development.

A medieval priory and the Cathedral have received more than £7m for their restoration and modernisation plans.
Work at the Cathedral to build a new public space, entrance area and to conserve the 15th Century Lady Chapel is expected to begin later this year.
At Llanthony Secunda Priory, the money will help restore its major buildings and bring them back into use.
The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) has awarded £4.16m towards the £6m wanted for Project Pilgrim - the title for the cathedral's three phases of planned development.
Anne Cranston, project manager, said: "We're extremely fortunate to have received so much support from so many people during the development of Project Pilgrim."
Less than a mile away, the Llanthony Secunda Priory Trust has been granted £3.2m.
Plans there include the restoration of the Medieval Range, Victorian Farmhouse and Brick Range as well as the grounds landscaped.
Jeremy Williamson, trust chair, said: "After eight years of dedication from trustees, friends, and volunteers and with support from local businesses and other funders we are now one big step closer to realising our ambition.
He added "we are ecstatic about the news of their generous support."
