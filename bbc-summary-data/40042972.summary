[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ferry passengers travelling to the Isle of Man have been told they will require photographic ID whilst the UK terror threat level remains critical.

The move comes after a suicide bomber killed 22 people - including children - and injured 64 at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on Monday.
Police said they have also increased patrols in wake of the attack.
More than 40,000 people are expected to travel to the Isle of Man over the next few weeks for the annual TT races.
A traffic lane at the airport has been closed with all pick-ups and drop-offs done in Ronaldsway's car parks.
A spokesman said additional resources are being deployed to offer "reassurance and enhance security".
Ferry passengers have been urged to carry identification and check in early for sailings in response to enhanced security measures at UK ports.
A spokesman said vehicle searches will also be increased.
Chief Executive Mark Woodward said: "We were given very little notice of the new police requirements at Heysham.
"We are fully cooperating and have been working with Lancashire Constabulary and our passengers to minimise disruption.
"It is a fast-developing situation which could soon affect other ports we sail from and we do not know how long the enhanced security measures will be in place."
Mr Woodward said whilst the Steam Packet don't require the ID, third parties such as the police may.
A government spokesman said a minute's silence will be observed at 11:00 BST as a "mark of respect for those who lost their lives".
