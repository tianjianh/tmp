Britain's eighth seed Murray, champion in 2012, is scheduled to face Russia's world number 96 at about 18:00 BST.
Murray will again take to the second show court during the afternoon heat, having suffered cramp in the same circumstances on Monday.
"I've felt fine the last couple days," the 27-year-old said on Thursday.
"I hope I feel better every day now."
The Scot enjoyed cooler conditions in the night session for Thursday's second-round match against Matthias Bachinger, and the temperature is expected to peak at around 25C on Saturday - considerably lower than on day one.

Murray has also benefited from surprise results in his section of the draw, at least in terms of rankings.
Kuznetsov, 23, beat 31st seed Fernando Verdasco in five sets to earn what he described as "probably the biggest match of my life" against Murray.
And Murray will not be taking anything for granted against a player enjoying his best season.
"He's had a couple of big wins in the Slams this year," said Murray. "He beat David Ferrer at Wimbledon and obviously Verdasco.
"I've never played him before. I don't know his game that well, but I've seen him play a little bit. He hits the ball pretty flat. Likes to go for his shots a lot.
"This court's fairly quick, so that will probably help him as well. But I'll watch a little bit of video, try to understand his game a bit better."
Unlike Murray, Kuznetsov does not need to do much research on his opponent.
"For sure, I know him better than he knows me, because I can see him on the TV and I watched a lot of his matches," said the Russian.
"He is a good player of course and a Grand Slam champion, but for me it's no pressure and I'm sure I will have some chances."
Kuznetsov won junior Wimbledon in 2009, but found climbing the senior rankings a tough process.
"It was pretty hard, I had some bad periods," he said.
"In the beginning it seemed it was going to be easy to go to the top 100 but I lost some matches. Finally I came to the top 100 two years ago and again this year."
The winner will go on to face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or Pablo Carreno Busta in the last 16.
