The 22-year-old son of former Wales international David came through Coventry's youth ranks and made 61 appearances for the Sky Blues.
Phillips becomes Rob Page's first signing since becoming manager of the 2015-16 League Two title winners.
"I remember watching Rob play for Coventry as a kid - I'm really looking forward to working for him," he said.
He continued to BBC Radio Northampton: "I've been at Coventry since the age of seven so it's a bit crazy (to leave), but that's life - the manager didn't want me.
"I'm just looking forward to showing Northampton fans what I've got and give it all I can."
