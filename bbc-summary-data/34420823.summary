Mr Newman was detained in Melbourne on Thursday after entering Australia without a visa.
Australia had cancelled his visa while he was still in the US on the grounds that his presence in the country could incite violence.
Mr Newman has previously called for the execution of abortion doctors and said women who have abortions are murderers.
On Friday, Justice Geoffrey Nettle in Melbourne ruled that the cancellation of Mr Newman's visa was justified, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
While Mr Newman may have had a case to challenge the cancellation, he should not have boarded a plane to Australia without a visa, said the judge.
"Acting as he did means he does not come to this court with clean hands," he said.
Mr Newman, also known as Troy Newman-Mariotti, had been due to speak at events run by the group Right to Life Australia.
But he was prevented from boarding a connecting flight in the US city of Denver on Tuesday after Immigration Minister Peter Dutton cancelled his visa.
It came after it emerged he had called in a 2000 book for doctors who perform abortions to face execution .
His wife Mellissa had presented his appeal to the high court in Melbourne.
"I don't know what they're afraid of. I don't know what they think he's going to do here," she was quoted as saying earlier by ABC News.
In a posting on Facebook ahead of his arrival in Melbourne, he said the decision to revoke his visa "was based on a pile of lies, including the idea that I promote violence".
"My 25-year history of peaceful, prayerful action speaks for itself," he said.
Earlier this week, Australian Labor MP Terri Butler wrote to Australia's Mr Dutton to ask that Mr Newman's visa be denied, calling him an "anti-choice extremist".
But the website for Mr Newman's organisation, Operation Rescue, insisted that he "has never advocated violence and in fact, urges pro-life activists to work within the governmental and legal system to accomplish change".
