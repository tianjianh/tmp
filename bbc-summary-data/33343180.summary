[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lt Col James Power Carne led 700 men of the Gloucestershire Regiment in a fight against more than 10,000 Chinese in the Battle of Imjin River in 1951.
He was eventually captured and spent 19 months in solitary confinement, and was later awarded the Victoria Cross.
He has been depicted on one of ten stamps issued to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the start of the war.
During the battle, in April 1951, the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, stemmed an attack by the vastly superior forces of the communist Chinese army.
It was a key moment in the war and gave other United Nations troops time to regroup and block the advance of Chinese and North Korean forces.
The battle led to the regiment acquiring its nickname the "Glorious Glosters".
Col Carne, the battalion's commanding officer, moved among the soldiers and inspired confidence among them while under very heavy mortar and machine gun fire.
Armed with a rifle and grenades, he twice led assault parties to drive back the enemy.
After his capture, Col Carne was kept in solitary confinement in North Korea. He was eventually released in September 1953.
The following month, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallantry and leadership.
While in captivity, he used a nail to carve a stone cross, which is now on display in Gloucester Cathedral.
General manager of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum, Chris Chatteron, said: "We're very proud. Col Carne is one of the legendary figures of the regiment.
"The fact that he's recognised for the phenomenal sacrifice and bravery that he showed at the battle of the Imjin River is testament to, not just him, but all the Glosters that were on that battlefield."
The other nine stamps feature Ralph Monclar from France, William Hamilton Shaw and James Alward Van Fleet from the US and six South Korean veterans.
The Korean War began in June 1950 and ended with an armistice agreement in July 1953.
