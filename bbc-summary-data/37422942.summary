Phase Two of £56m Robin Hood Airport Doncaster road approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for the second section of a £56m dual carriageway linking the M18 with Robin Hood Airport have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The road will run between Bawtry Road and Hurst Lane in Doncaster and link the Great Yorkshire Way, which opened in February, to the terminal.
Construction of the one-mile stretch of road is expected to begin before the end of the year and it is hoped it will be open by late 2017.
Doncaster Mayor Ros Jones said she was "delighted" the plans had won approval.
"The final section will enhance the remarkable transformation this link road is having for Doncaster and particularly our international airport," she said.
