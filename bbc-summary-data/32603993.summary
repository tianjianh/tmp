Emergency services were called to the incident on the A4232 near junction 33 of the M4 at 05:45 BST on Wednesday.
Repairs were carried out and both carriageways to Culverhouse Cross were reopened at about 11:55.
The Federation of Small Businesses said the incident "highlighted the fragility of Cardiff's transport infrastructure".
FSB Wales spokesman Rhodri Evans said: "Getting around Cardiff can be a challenge for our members on normal working days, but the crash today has had a significant knock-on impact for business across Cardiff.
"We need to find ways of reducing the strain on our roads network and finding other ways of getting people around our capital, particularly at peak times.
"Today's incident underlines why we need to start seeing progress on the proposed South Wales Metro system so that we have a more resilient transport system in Cardiff should this sort of incident occur in future."
The Welsh government said Â£77m was being invested in the first phase of the metro project and work was being carried out to develop the next phase.
A spokesperson added: "Securing additional investment from the European Structural Fund and private sector, together with the improvements to the Great Western Main Line and Valley Lines will deliver a step change in integrated transport for south Wales and provide a template for public transport across the whole of Wales."
The incident caused tailbacks in neighbouring counties, with motorists reporting delays of up to two hours.
Bus travel in and around the city was affected and pupils travelling to schools in Cardiff and Vale of Glamorgan were caught up in the delays.
Nikki Boniwell, who was travelling to Cardiff from Swansea, said her normal one-hour journey took two-and-a-half-hours.
Earlier on Wednesday, Jennie Griffiths, head of South Wales Fire and Rescue Service's control room, said crews were using specialist absorbent materials to contain and secure further spillage of the tanker's load on to the road.
