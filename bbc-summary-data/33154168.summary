US orders ban on 'unsafe' trans-fats

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Trans-fats are unsafe to eat and must be banned from the food supply within three years, US regulators have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The US Food and Drug Administration said partially hydrogenated oils (PHOs), the main source of trans-fats, are not "generally recognised as safe".
It said a ban would save lives by preventing fatal heart attacks.
Food suppliers have been required to show trans-fats information on food labels since 2006 but health experts say Americans still consume too much.
"The FDA's action on this major source of artificial trans-fat demonstrates the agency's commitment to the heart health of all Americans," said FDA's Acting Commissioner Stephen Ostroff.
"This action is expected to reduce coronary heart disease and prevent thousands of fatal heart attacks every year."
Since the FDA started labelling trans-fats, the agency estimates that consumption of them decreased by 78% in the US.
The UK has been calling for a ban on trans-fats for several years.
In Denmark, almost all trans-fats have been banned since 2003.
