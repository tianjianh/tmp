Four police officers and a member of police staff were injured as riot police clashed with crowds on 9 May.
Graffiti referring to "Tory scum" was also daubed on The Women of World War II monument on Whitehall.
Fifteen people were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder and three for assault.
All have been bailed pending further inquiries, police said.
The Met Police said one officer was treated at hospital for a suspected dislocated shoulder and a member of staff needed hospital treatment for a cut lip after being struck by an object.
Three other officers were assaulted but did not require hospital treatment.
Acting Cdr Colin Morgan, of the Public Order Command, said: "A number of officers were injured during the disorder and the Women In World War II Memorial was damaged with graffiti.
"I'm urging anyone who recognises these men to come forward and assist us with our investigation."
Hundreds of anti-government protesters, some holding placards reading "I pledge to resist" and "Stop the cuts", took part in the rally, which began outside Conservative Party headquarters.
After the protest, police said the "vast majority" of protesters had taken part peacefully but added a "small minority" had been intent on causing disorder.
