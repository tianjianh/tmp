[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shaun Walmsley, 28, was getting into a cab with prison officers outside Aintree Hospital on Tuesday when he was sprung from custody by two armed men.
Merseyside Police arrested a 25-year-old man from Norris Green on Friday on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.
He has now been released pending further enquiries, police said.
A 27-year-old man and a woman, 26, who were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of assisting an offender were also released on Friday.
Walmsley is one of four men serving life sentences for the "vicious and savage" stabbing of Anthony Duffy in 2014.
Described as "highly dangerous", he was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years.
The 28-year-old fled from outside Aintree University Hospital in a gold Volvo when two armed men ambushed the taxi after his appointment.
CCTV images were released showing the moment the armed men threatened prison officers.
Detectives said they were working with police forces across the UK and abroad to locate Walmsley, and appealed to members of the public for information.
Officers warned people not to approach the escapee as he, or those with him, may be armed.
