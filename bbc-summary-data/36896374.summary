[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Tyrone village's attempt to be crowned Britain in Bloom champion for 2016 has been uprooted by a "pointless act of vandalism".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Judging on Tuesday had to be postponed after two cases of vandalism in the village overnight.
Police have appealed for information after large planter pots outside Parkanaur Forest Park were tipped over and plants in a garden at a house on Kileeshill Road were also destroyed.
Ulster Unionist MLA Rosemary Barton said members of the Castlecaufield Horticultural Society had put tremendous effort into the competition.
She said the damage may have been caused to ruin the village's chances of winning it.
"It is clear that there are some out there who are intent on disrupting the chances of Castlecaufield being crowned Village in Bloom 2016 and Britain in Bloom 2016," she said.
"Judging was set to take place in the village today, however, following this pointless act of vandalism last night, I believe judging has been postponed until Monday August 1.
"Various flower pots containing beautiful displays have been smashed across the road. I cannot comprehend the reasoning behind such an attack.
"The members of the Castlecaufield Horticultural Society put in tremendous effort each year for the Village in Bloom competition, so I am extremely annoyed to see their hard work being destroyed time and time again."
Sgt Brian Greenaway said: "I would appeal to anyone who say anything suspicious in either of these areas overnight, or to anyone who can assist in our enquiries in any way, to contact police in Dungannon on 101.
"Alternatively, information can be given anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111."
