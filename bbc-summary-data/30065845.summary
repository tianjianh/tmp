Stoke City 1-2 Burnley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Danny Ings scored twice in two minutes as Burnley beat Stoke to claim their first away win of the season and move off the bottom of the Premier League.

Ings put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute when he tapped in after Asmir Begovic parried Ashley Barnes's cross.
The striker grabbed his second soon after, with another close-range finish following Michael Kightly's low pass.
Jon Walters pulled one back with a diving header for Stoke, but the Clarets held on for the valuable win.
The victory means Sean Dyche's side have now won back-to-back Premier League games and move above QPR and Crystal Palace into 18th place.
While they were fortunate to hold on against a wasteful Stoke side, Burnley showed plenty of effort and character.
They conceded 15 goals in a five-match period between the end of September and the start of November, but have followed that with a 1-0 win against Hull and a battling defensive performance to take the three points at Britannia Stadium.
But for Stoke it was a disappointing afternoon. The Potters had numerous chances to secure a point but could not force a second goal past a resolute away defence.
One of the hosts' best chances came when Bojan, who supplied the cross for Walters's goal, released Victor Moses with a clever backheel, but the winger's powerful effort was punched to safety by Tom Heaton.
The hosts, who had 73% of possession and had 14 corners compared to none from the visitors, brought on Marko Arnautovic and Peter Crouch for Moses and Mame Biram Diouf as they pushed for an equaliser.
Bojan was instrumental in Stoke's best work and his floated cross was flicked goalwards by Crouch, but the ball narrowly went wide.
Another substitute, Charlie Adam, had another effort to snatch a point but his powerful effort from 25 yards was well held by Heaton.
With Burnley defending with 10 players in their own penalty area during five minutes of injury time, there was one further chance for Stoke but goalkeeper Begovic headed over.
Stoke City manager Mark Hughes said: "We're disappointed with the opening period and that's what has cost us the three points. We were totally dominant.
"[Erik] Pieters failed a fitness test and our back four was thrown together this morning, but we're still a team that should not allow the opponent to go into a 2-0 lead."
Stoke City defender Ryan Shawcross said: "We had a brilliant performance in the win at Tottenham but threw that all away. We have lost at home to Leicester, Aston Villa and Burnley, three teams in the bottom half, and that's something we have to work on."
