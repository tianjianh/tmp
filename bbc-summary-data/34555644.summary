[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cleveland Police has said it is looking into a complaint about pension contributions to Redcar steel workers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The site closed on Monday with the loss of 2,200 jobs, after its Thai-based owner SSI went into liquidation, and no buyer could be found.
Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesbrough, then wrote to police expressing concerns about missed payments to the pension scheme.
The force has now said it is liaising with the Insolvency Service.
In his letter to Cleveland Police, Mr McDonald said evidence suggested SSI UK had deducted pension contributions from workers' salaries but these "funds were not paid over to the relevant pension provider."
It continues: "I would be obliged if you would accept this letter as a formal complaint."
In a statement the force said: "Cleveland Police's Economic Crime Unit is liaising with the Insolvency Service following the receipt of a complaint regarding the misallocation of pension contributions from SSI workers."
