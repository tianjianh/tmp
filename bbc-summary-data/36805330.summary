Two horses, Joey and Topthorn, along with a goose and a pair of crows will be auctioned, in the only time a full set of original puppets will be made available.
Eight sets of puppets were made for the production, three of which are being preserved for future shows.
The puppets are being sold in aid of the Handspring Trust, a charity for puppet theatre arts.
They were designed and made for the production by the Handspring Puppet Company.
The play is the National Theatre's most successful play, having had a seven-year run in the West End and toured to 10 countries.
Based on Michael Morpurgo's 1982 novel, it has been seen by more than seven million people around the world.
The play tells of a farmer's boy, Albert, whose horse, Joey, is sold to the cavalry during World War One and shipped to France.
The first War Horse puppet was acquired in 2013 by London's Victoria and Albert Museum.
The sale will take place at Bonhams in London on 13 September.
