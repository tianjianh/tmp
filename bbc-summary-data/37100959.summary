[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
1. See puppies being put through their paces (Forfar)
A training school for puppies, the Guide Dog Centre in Forfar will be welcoming in the dog-loving public. At any one point, 80 to 100 pups could be going through vital assistance dog training and you could get a chance to see it happen.
2. Be a dentist for the day (Dundee)
Visitors can really get their teeth into a "doors open" trip around Dundee Dental Hospital.
Tours of the building will take in rarely seen artwork by James McIntosh Patrick, as well as stunning stained-glass windows by Douglas Strachan. The event is part of the Dental Hospital and School's Centenary Celebrations.
3. Explore the remains of a crypt and medieval hospital (Soutra, south-east of Edinburgh)
Soutra Aisle, dating back to 1686, is a family burial vault which was built when the Scottish church banned monuments inside churches.
Visitors can explore the macabre unlocked crypt and marvel at what was once the largest hospital in medieval Scotland. The site sits at an altitude over 360 metres and was the highest monastery in the British Isles.
4. Have a hoot (Ayrshire)
The traditional-looking Owl Cote tower was built in 2008/10 as a nest site for wild barn owls. It looks like it has been a success this year as research from 2016 shows there has been barn owl activity. The question is, will you spot one of these feathery residents when you enter the Ayrshire brick and bottle built round-house?
5. Catch a courtroom drama (Selkirk)
The thrilling Sir Walter Scott court case re-enactment will have crime, drama, mystery and intrigue. Visitors can watch as Sir Walter Scott presides over a court case involving robbery and a secret liaison.
6. Stage fright or star-struck? (Glasgow)
Sneak backstage and find out what goes on behind the scenes at Glasgow's vibrant Citizens Theatre .
7. Lights, camera, action
Greenock Waterfront Cinema will be where it's at for those intrigued by how the big films get on the big screen. Guests will have the chance to tour the projection rooms and find out the ins and outs of how they work.
8. Before the smart phone
Put together by telecommunications enthusiast Max Flemmich, the Darvel: Private Telephone Museum celebrates 100 years of the telephone and includes working installations where visitors can dial on the phone or try tapping out Morse Code.
9.A whole new universe
Crawick Multiverse was an open cast coal mine, but it has now been transformed by Charles Jencks into a breathtaking landscape celebrating space, astrology and cosmology.
10. Lighting the way
Cromarty Lighthouse was decommissioned in 2005 and now the Lighthouse Tower, Keeper's Cottage and Old Buoy Store are used for marine research and teaching by the University of Aberdeen.
Visitors will be able to tour the building and meet staff and students to hear about their research on seals, dolphins and seabirds.
Doors Open Days are running throughout Scotland every weekend in September and are co-ordinated by the Scottish Civic Trust. Head to their website for the full programme.
