The True Blood star died after years of suffering from drug and alcohol abuse.
In a statement, his family said Ellis, 39, was ashamed of his addiction and did not want to talk about it.
But they added: "His family, however, believes that in death he would want his life to serve as a cautionary tale in an attempt to help others."
Speaking to the Hollywood Reporter through his manager Emily Gerson Saines, the family's statement continued: "Nelsan was a gentle, generous and kind soul.
"He was a father, a son, a grandson, a brother, a nephew, and a great friend to those that were lucky enough to know him."
Talking about the circumstances behind Ellis's death from heart failure, the statement explained: "After many stints in rehab, Nelsan attempted to withdraw from alcohol on his own.
"According to his father, during his withdrawal from alcohol he had a blood infection, his kidneys shut down, his liver was swollen, his blood pressure plummeted, and his dear sweet heart raced out of control."
Ellis played the flamboyant Lafayette Reynolds, a charismatic gay medium who was able to contact ghosts, in the HBO horror-drama series.
He appeared regularly throughout the series of True Blood after first appearing as the cook at a local restaurant in 2008.
He also featured alongside Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer in the film adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel The Help in 2011.
