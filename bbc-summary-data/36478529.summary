Police said two men escaped with a cash box after threatening G4S staff with weapons inside Santander, West Princes Street, Helensburgh, at 00:35.
Two men escaped with a five-figure sum of cash following a similar early-morning raid on 6 April.
Police said one line of inquiry was that both robberies were linked.
The G4S staff were not injured in the latest robbery.
The suspects are described as being of medium height, medium build and were wearing overalls and masks.
Det Insp Douglas Wilson, who is leading the investigation, said: "Two men entered the premises of the bank, by means of the window, threatened the men with weapons and then made off with the cash box in an unknown direction - possibly using a dark coloured 4x4 vehicle in their escape.
"Officers remain at the scene on West Princes Street and local door-to-door inquiries are underway. Specialist officers are analysing available CCTV."
The detective said that a dedicated incident room had been set up at Helensburgh police office.
He added: "Our inquiries are at an early stage. At this time, we are asking that anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or heard a disturbance in the area in the early hours of this morning, to please contact officers as soon as possible."
