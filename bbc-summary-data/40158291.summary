The 20-year-old has represented his country at under-21 level, but did not play a senior game for the Addicks.
"I'm really happy to get this over the line and I just want pre-season to start now," Mitov said.
"I can take plenty of experience from my time at Charlton as I spent a lot of time around the first-team there."
