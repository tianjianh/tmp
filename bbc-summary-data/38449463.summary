[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Mohammed Abdurezek, 31, was found in Gibbs Lane, Siston, at 10.10am on Saturday.
Officers want to retrace his steps in the hours before his death, locate his mobile phone and identify the vehicle he was transported in.
A post-mortem examination confirmed Mr Abdurezek died of multiple stab wounds.
Det Ch Insp James Riccio, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "We have a team of officers and staff working tirelessly to find out who killed Mohammed and why.
"We don't believe he was murdered at the location where his body was found, and we're actively tracing his movements in the hours and days leading up to his death to establish where he was killed.
"Our focus is also on trying to identify the vehicle used to transport Mohammed's body to Siston and CCTV is being examined from the local area."
Police would like to speak anybody who may have seen a suspicious vehicle, or a parked vehicle, in the area around Siston Lane between the evening of 21 December and Christmas Eve morning.
Mr Abdurezek was based in Bristol but had links to other locations in the UK, including Swansea and Newcastle.
Mr Riccio added: "We're in contact with some of Mohammed's friends and associates to try to trace any family members or next of kin, who we believe live abroad.
"I firmly believe someone has information which could help establish who killed Mohammed. I'd ask them to call us immediately."
