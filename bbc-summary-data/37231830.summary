A mother found a sac of "potentially deadly" baby spiders in a bunch of bananas she bought from Lidl.

Caroline Bagshaw said a "horrible" dead adult spider and about 10 live babies fell out of the fruit in her kitchen.
Geoff Grewcock, of Nuneaton and Warwickshire Wildlife Sanctuary, thought they were Brazilian Wandering Spiders whose "bite could kill you".
Lidl told the BBC it was investigating and would compensate Ms Bagshaw for the cost of fumigating her home.

A spokeswoman for Lidl said the supermarket needed a statement from a wildlife expert confirming the species of spider and a quote from fumigators to cover the cost.
Ms Bagshaw bought the bananas from Lidl's Nuneaton branch.
Mr Grewcock said the curled up spider was larger than a 50p but would have been at least double the size when alive with its legs outstretched.
He said: "[Ms Bagshaw] had put the bananas in a bag and tied it shut. When I looked inside I saw about 10 spiderlings running around. I put the bag in the freezer.
"The babies were too small to do any harm but you don't want them trying to find somewhere warm enough to survive.
"If it is the Wandering Spider it's very dangerous. It's one of the worst spiders out there."
A vet is now examining the adult spider and spiderlings to determine the species, he said.
Last year a Wandering Spider, known as the most venomous in the world, was found in a Staffordshire warehouse.
Ms Bagshaw said: "[The spider] looked horrible. You could see its little eyes on it head and these massive black things at the front of its mouth.
"Even though the babies are not necessarily going to survive, there's that possibly that they could, and I can't take that risk having a two-year-old and a five-year-old."
She said she had paid Â£150 to fumigate her home to ensure her house was "free from deadly creatures".
