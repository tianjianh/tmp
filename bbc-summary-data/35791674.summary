[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hartlepool moved nine points clear of the bottom two with a battling goalless draw away at mid-table Crawley.

In a poor first half, Nathan Thomas nearly opened the scoring for Pools but his fierce drive went just wide.
Thomas continued to impress after the break and was unlucky to see his effort powerfully strike the crossbar.
With time running out, Crawley nearly stole the victory against the run of play but Sonny Bradley headed agonisingly wide from three yards out.

Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey: "Literally the last kick touch of the ball, you're expecting it from five yards out for the net to bulge and it could have been a bit fortunate to grab the three points.
"But it wasn't to be and probably a draw was a fair result in the end.
"We had to dig in and I wanted to see more in the second half and I thought there was more in the tank."
