You could call it a conflict of interest.

On a US news programme, journalist Charlo Greene was doing a story about marijuana and the Alaskan Cannabis Club.
Off screen, the KTVA reporter was the president of the Alaskan Cannabis Club.
In a clip that's been shared around the world, Greene outed herself as the owner of the business, which claims to help medical marijuana patients in the US state.
Once she'd explained who she was, she calmly looked down the camera, swore and then quit her job live on air.
The shot then cut to a stunned colleague who awkwardly tried to figure out what had just happened and apologised for the language used.
Later, KTVA news director Bert Rudman said in a statement that he apologised for the "inappropriate language" and revealed Greene's contract had been terminated.
On-air, Charlo Greene said she was going to devote time to try to legalise marijuana in Alaska.
In a vote due to take place in November, Alaskans are due to consider whether that should be the case.
If that does happen, Alaska would follow Colorado and Washington which became the first US states to allow the drug to be sold recreationally.
Greene said she decided to speak out to answer critics who compared regulation of cannabis with the legalisation of methamphetamine or crack cocaine.
In a separate video, Greene defended her actions saying "If responsible adults should be allowed to choose how they like to drink, why differentiate my toke from your beer?".
