[SN]TITLE[SN]
Portsmouth days-old baby 'murdered by his mother'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 19-day-old baby who suffered a brain injury and a fractured skull was murdered by his mother, a jury heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nicola Brown, 43, of Agincourt Road, Portsmouth, denies murdering her son Jake on 19 December 2014.
She is also charged with two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mrs Brown's husband Jason Brown, 44, is also on trial at Winchester Crown Court charged with causing or allowing a child's death.
The court was played a 999 call Mrs Brown made from her home, in which she said Jake stopped breathing while she was feeding him.
She also said he had fallen out of his Moses basket the day before, the court heard.
Nigel Lickley QC, prosecuting, said Jake was taken first to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, then the paediatric unit at Southampton General Hospital where he died later that day.
A post-mortem examination showed the baby had a fractured skull, brain injury and bleeding to the eyes from "an impact to the head requiring substantial force", the jury was told.
Mr Lickley said his injuries were not consistent with a fall from a Moses basket, and tests showed he had suffered rib fractures on two earlier occasions.
The jury also heard Mrs Brown had anxiety issues, high blood pressure, and had been in denial about her pregnancy until a few weeks before giving birth.
Mrs Brown, who was called Nicola Long when she was charged earlier this year, denies murder and two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.
Mr Brown denies a charge of causing or allowing the death of a child. The prosecution claims he must have been aware of the risk to Jake, but failed to protect him.
The trial continues.
