Alan Archibald: Partick Thistle boss will 'attract better offers than Swindon' - Lawless

Swindon Town will not be the last club to express an interest in Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald this summer, Stevie Lawless has predicted.

The Thistle midfielder was speaking after BBC Scotland revealed Archibald is on the English League One club's shortlist for a new team boss.
"The ball's in his court," said Lawless, whose side will finish in the Premiership's top six this season.
"I would be surprised if that was the last offer he has this pre-season."
The Thistle boss rejected a move to Shrewsbury Town in October and they managed to retain their place in League One under Paul Hurst ahead of relegated Swindon.
Archibald has an ambition to manage in England but has stressed there has been no approach from the Robins.
"Personally, I wouldn't have thought that would be something that would interest him," said Lawless, 26.
"He knows everything about this club, he's made improvements every single year and I don't think he feels it is a job finished here.
"I think his stock's a bit higher after his achievements this year, but it comes down to his choice and whether he feels it is the right time.
"You never know. The budgets could be completely different, the facilities - these are things managers look at."
English clubs have also made tentative enquiries about Thistle central defender Liam Lindsay and Lawless believes the 21-year-old has the ability to play to a good level there.
"Shaun Hutchinson, I played with him at Motherwell, and he went down to Fulham," the midfielder recalled.
"He had a rough start, but he managed to do pretty well for a few seasons and is at Millwall now and in a play-off final.
"He [Lindsay] is very similar to Hutchy, so I don't see why he can't go down and do as well - if not better."
Uncapped Lindsay is eager to play for Gordon Strachan's Scotland team but has never been called up at youth level.
"Personally, I think he could do a job," added Lawless of his team-mate. "It is definitely one of those positions where we need to be looking for new talent.
"Maybe if he gets a move down south and the level he is playing at down there is a bit better then why not?
"If he keeps progressing the way he is, I don't see why he wouldn't be in the Scotland squad."
