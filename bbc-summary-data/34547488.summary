Eye contact experiment brings strangers together

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
How often do we really look into someone's eyes?

We share quick glances with strangers in the street and look lovingly at friends and family, but how often do we hold their gaze for longer than a few seconds?
Not often enough says Nuala McKeever, who calls herself a happiness teacher.
Nuala believes eye contact could help us reconnect with each other in a powerful and spiritual way, and the 40-year-old knows a thing or two about the human spirit.
After leaving a high-pressured job in the financial services sector, Nuala went on a journey of discovery which led to her becoming a 'laughter-yoga' teacher.
Originally from Londonderry, she now lives in Belfast and runs the Sunshine Project with friend Michelle Major.
As part of their mission to spread peace and love, the pair held an event near Victoria Square, Belfast, on Thursday at which they encouraged members of the public to share 60 seconds of eye contact with a volunteer.
I went along to see how it felt to share such an intimate moment with a stranger.
The group set themselves up at Belfast's Corn Market at lunchtime.
Each volunteer gazer was positioned inside a hula hoop, on a cushion or on a chair with an empty space in front of them.
Members of the public were encouraged to come along and sit or stand in front of the volunteer and, without speaking, stare into their eyes for 60 seconds.
I was paired with Nuala, who explained to me that we should each stare into the other's left eye; this would stop us from breaking eye contact by flicking our gaze from one eye to the other.
As our 60 seconds began I started to feel uncomfortable.
Nuala on the other hand, with her head tilted slightly to the side, looked the picture of calm.
As the seconds ticked by I wanted to search her face or look down but our eyes were locked together.
When I accepted this and slowly relaxed, I began to feel some of the positive effects of the practice.
I felt very calm and everything in the background went out of focus.
For a brief moment it was as though we were the only two people in the busy city centre.
When the session came to an end, Nuala threw her arms around me, an act that would have felt much more bizarre if I hadn't spent the last 60 seconds staring at her.
She told me I had made her feel emotional but she wasn't sure why.
She said: "I often see myself when I stare into someone's eyes.
"Eye contact is how we connect as human beings and it is different every time, but it always reminds me that I am part of something much bigger than myself.
"When we look into each other's eyes we see beyond our difference, I can't think of anywhere where this is more important than in Belfast."
One of the participants, Marcela Vojacova, 44, explained why she got involved in the project.
"I wanted to see what could be achieved by staring into another person's eyes and what I might see," she said.
"When I take part I feel a sense of fulfilment, love and happiness - I hope the other people do too."
Mark Graham, who stopped by the event to see if it would help him de-stress, was surprised by his experience.
"I have a job interview coming up and sharing 60 seconds with Marcela really helped me to relax," he said.
"For the time we were sharing the experience it was like no one else was around.
"I think a lot of people would laugh at the idea of taking part in something like this but it could be really helpful for some."
