Poole Town: Banned boss watches game from skylight window

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A banished non-league manager came up with an original way to get round his stadium ban - by watching the game through a skylight.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Poole Town boss Tom Killick used the window of groundsman Chris Kelly's home overlooking the club's Tatnam ground.
Killick saw his side beat Cambridge City 3-2 on Saturday to stay top of the Southern League Premier Division.
"In some ways it's a better view because I'm looking at things from above," Killick told BBC Radio Solent.
"Sometimes it's better to see the match from that perspective, but the big thing is the lack of communication with the players. That is what I'm finding difficult."
Killick was serving the fifth match of a six-game suspension for comments made to a referee during a defeat by Redditch on 17 January.
