Tom Wood: England and Northampton Saints flanker banned for the Argentina tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Wood will miss England's two-Test tour of Argentina after being banned for six weeks for stamping while playing for Northampton Saints.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 30-year-old flanker was sent off during the European Champions Cup play-off win over Stade Francais on Friday after an incident with Djibril Camara.
An independent committee concluded Wood's stamp resulted in reckless contact with Camara's head.
Eddie Jones' England side are due to play Argentina on 10 and 17 June.
Wood was part of the 31-man squad to travel to South America and now joins the injured Joe Marchant, Denny Solomona and Saints team-mate Paul Hill in being unable to play.
The committee initially imposed a 12-week ban, but after taking into account Wood's guilty plea, expression of remorse and good disciplinary record, it was reduced to six weeks.
Meanwhile, Saints team-mate Rory Hutchinson has been banned for two weeks for tackling Stade Francais' Australian scrum-half Will Genia in the air.
