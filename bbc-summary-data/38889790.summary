[SN]TITLE[SN]
Morecambe 0-1 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tom Champion scored the only goal of the game as Barnet took the points against 10-man Morecambe with a 1-0 League Two win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Champion scored with a neat header on 65 minutes after the home side, who lost skipper Peter Murphy on 26 minutes to a straight red card for a tackle on Ruben Bover, dropped their guard for the first time in the game as Jamal Campbell-Ryce crossed from a quickly-taken corner.
The visitors kept possession well with the man advantage and should have made the victory more comfortable as they created a number of chances.
On 34 minutes the Bees were awarded a penalty when John Akinde went down under the challenge of Ryan Edwards but the prolific Bees striker saw his spot kick easily saved by Barry Roche.
The first chance of any note fell to the visitors when Campbell-Ryce delivered a pinpoint cross for Mauro Vilhete but the striker turned his header wide of the target from a great position.
Barnet went close again with Morecambe defender Alex Whitmore producing two superb blocks to deny Campbell-Ryce and Bover firing straight at Roche from good openings on two occasions when he should have done better.
Morecambe's only effort of any note came early in the game when Kevin Ellison turned and shot straight at Josh Vickers.
