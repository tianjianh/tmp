MPs are demanding highways officials explain why roadworks on the A55 and A483 on the Chester-Wrexham border have over-run, causing months of frustration and long hold-ups for motorists.

Highways England say the Â£6m layout changes on the Posthouse roundabout proved more difficult than anticipated.
Work began last summer and was expected to finish by March but it has now been pushed back to 28 June.
Wrexham MP Ian Lucas said the route was vital to the region's economy.
"Deadlines were set, missed, then extended, not once but again and again - and the level of information given to motorists has been very poor indeed," he said.
New Chester MP Chris Matheson added: "The chaos these works have caused has been a real issue for Chester for months."
A Highways England spokesperson said: "We are doing everything we can to complete the A55/A483 scheme as quickly as possible.
"We have rescheduled the street lighting installation work to take place overnight in July, so that we are able to fully open the roundabout and start operating the traffic lights from Monday 29 June."
