[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Officers were called to the Kings Arms pub on The Green, at Tamerton Foliot, at about 01:30 GMT.
A 27-year-old local man died at the scene and two others were treated at Derriford Hospital, a Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said.
He added weapons had been seized and a 20 and a 21-year-old man had been arrested.
Det Supt Jim Colwell said it was to early to say what the reason for the incident was.
He said: "We know there were two weapons involved, we have recovered an axe type weapon from near the scene.  We are keen to recover the second weapon described as a blade or knife.
"I would ask residents living in the area to look in their gardens and tell us if they find anything meeting that description."
Devon and Cornwall Police said both suspects were being detained at Charles Cross Police Station in Plymouth.
Phil Edmonds, who has lived in the area for a number of years, said: "This is such a lovely little village, it is really shocking, I was gobsmacked really."
A number of people called police to report a man holding a knife and an axe, with further calls of disturbance later in the morning.
Det Supt Colwell said: "We are appealing for anyone who witnessed the incident or who was in the Tamerton Foliot area this morning to contact the police.
"We have established a cordon at Station Road to assist with scene investigation and our officers will be active in the area throughout the day conducting enquiries."
