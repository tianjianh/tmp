A strike threat over job cuts at the University of Surrey has been lifted.

The University and College Union (UCU) balloted 292 members last month, who voted in favour of industrial action over 75 potential job cuts.
The UCU said it had now called off the dispute after the university increased voluntary redundancies and reduced the number of jobs to be axed.
The university, based at Guildford, said it had reached the required staff cuts without compulsory redundancies.
Students feared the job cuts threatened the university's politics department.
Campaign group Save Surrey's Politics Department said it would now lose four lecturers instead of nine and the postgraduate politics courses would continue.
"We feel both happy and sad," the students said in a statement on Facebook.
"Happy because the politics department is staying, sad because we see four incredible lecturers/professors leaving."
As well as politics, jobs are to go in arts and music, electronic engineering, bioscience and computing.
UCU spokesman Michael Moran thanked students for their support during the dispute.
"This is a very good outcome for everyone," he said.
"Strike action is always a last resort and we are delighted that we have managed to reach a settlement without the need for any disruption."
The university said it would continue to have constructive discussions to implement staff changes.
