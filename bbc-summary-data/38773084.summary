[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ali Hassan, 22, Abdul Hussain, 25, and Bader Nokhas, 25, were said to be driving "stupidly" on London's North Circular in Enfield in December 2013.
Hassan's Vauxhall Astra crashed into a Subaru Impreza, which careered out of control into a lorry.
Jawad Qureshi, 28, and his passengers Toheed Rubani, 34, and Haider Qureshi, 28, died in the crash.
Hassan, of Stonebridge, London; Hussain, of Edgware, London; and Nokhas, of Stanmore, Middlesex, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey last year to careless driving.
On Friday, they were each jailed for nine months and disqualified from driving for 19 months.
The court heard the convicted men were, on average, all speeding up to 18mph over the limit.
Witness Ben Sheybany described the way they were "chasing each other" as "stupid".
Judge Noel Lucas said: "Playing games on a public highway is simply not to be tolerated."
He said the crash could only be described as "horrific" and had a "dramatic" ripple effect on the lives of the grieving families.
