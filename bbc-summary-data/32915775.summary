The 27 mile (43km) route created by the Canal and River Trust involved improving access to the River Soar and adding platforms for boats.
The Â£12,000 project was funded mostly by donations from the public.
The route starts at Trent Lock, near Long Eaton, in Derbyshire, and passes through Loughborough and Leicester to Narborough.
Andy Oughton, from the trust's Central Shires waterway partnership said: "There's something very special about canoeing on the River Soar, it's a great opportunity to see Leicester from a completely different perspective."
The trail was launched as part of the national Go Canoeing week, a selection of events to encourage more people on to the water.
