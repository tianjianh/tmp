Well-wishers for Robin Gibb are being asked to donate to a Manx charity instead of sending funeral flowers.

The Bee Gees singer, who died aged 62 after a lengthy battle with cancer, was born in the Isle of Man in 1949.
His family have requested donations to children's hospice Rebecca House in Douglas.
The facility, which provides care for children with life-threatening conditions, was officially opened by Gibb and his wife, Dwina, in 2008.
Speaking of the arrangements, hospice chairman Sir Miles Walker said: "You never really think people as famous as Robin would remember a hospice in the Isle of Man.
"To think that through all this difficulty the family have made this gesture, well, I don't know, words fail me - I just think it is so generous."
The Gibb brothers were all born in the Isle of Man and although the family soon moved to Manchester, Robin later bought a home in the west of the island, near Peel, where he and his wife Dwina spent holidays.
Speaking in an interview in 2009, Robin Gibb said: "The Isle of Man is ancient, mystical and magical, that is why I have always loved this place."
