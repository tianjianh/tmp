[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chesterfield defender Liam Graham will miss the rest of the season after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham will have surgery on the injury, which he suffered while playing for New Zealand in a World Cup qualifier.
The 24-year-old had made six appearances for the Spireites in all competitions this season.
"It is really unfortunate for him with his first-team and international career now starting to take off," physio Rodger Wylde told the club website.
