The 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo is being marked with an exhibition of records rarely seen by the public at Cambridge University Library.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The battle in present-day Belgium on 18 June 1815 saw the final defeat of French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, by Allies including the British, led by the Duke of Wellington, and the Prussians.
The university has been obtaining records including books and maps since the end of the battle. It is hosting a public exhibition on 1 May, but prior to that is putting many of its items online for people to see around the world.
In this interactive video, you can take a closer look at some of the exhibits and witness how hundreds of years' worth of records are put on to the internet.
Production by David Keller, John Galliver and John Lawrence.
