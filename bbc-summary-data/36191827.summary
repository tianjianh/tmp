Night Tube: RMT maintenance workers balloted on strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Maintenance workers belonging to the RMT union are voting on whether to strike over their Night Tube pay and conditions deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The union said the dispute, affecting workers employed by Tube Lines, was over pay, pensions and staffing.
The RMT agreed a deal for its drivers two months ago, but said the one offered to the 1,500 Tube Lines staff was "inferior".
The Night Tube was due to start in September.
Trains would run throughout Friday and Saturday nights on five Underground lines.
But Transport for London (TfL) struggled to secure a deal with the unions and the service is now expected to launch sometime later this year.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: "RMT members are furious at the cynical way that Tube Lines have attempted to tie in attacks on pensions with the offer on pay and night Tube, and our reps for this group of over 1,000 safety-critical staff have unanimously thrown the whole package out.
"As a result, the ballot for both strike action and action short of a strike opens today."
The BBC has approached TfL for comment.
