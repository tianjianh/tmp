Andy McWilliams, the agent for the defeated UKIP candidate David Sprason, told the BBC he made the complaint after a series of postal votes were rejected two days before the elections.
He said 430 rejected ballots were being examined.
Labour's Lord Bach secured the post with a majority of 19,883.
Mr McWilliams said about 30 of the ballots had signatures which did not match those on applications submitted for a postal vote.
He said 430 rejected ballots were being examined.
In a statement, a Leicestershire Police spokesman said: "Leicestershire Police has received an allegation of electoral malpractice which is believed to have taken place during the police and crime commissioner elections.
"Enquiries are ongoing into the report and we are liaising with the Electoral Commission and the local authority."
Lord Bach, who was created a life peer in 1998 as Baron Bach of Lutterworth, was elected to the role of PCC for Leicestershire after the incumbent, Conservative Sir Clive Loader, stepped down. He will take office on 12 May.
As the Labour candidate he received 78,188 votes, while his nearest rival, the Conservative Neil Bannister, polled 58,305 votes.
