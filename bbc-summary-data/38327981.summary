Detectives investigating the murder of an Aberdeenshire man want to trace the author of a letter given to police which had information about the death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brian McKandie, 67, was attacked and killed at Fairview Cottages, Rothienorman, on Friday 11 or Saturday 12 March 2016.
The letter was sent to a police station later that month.
Officers are also trying to identify a man seen walking near Mr McKandie's home at 01:00 on the Saturday.
Mr McKandie was beaten with a heavy weapon and police believe he may have known his killer. His body was found on 12 March.
Det Ch Insp Iain Smith said: "In late March an anonymous letter was received which provided some information regarding the death of Mr McKandie.
"I would like to appeal to that person to come forward and identify themselves as we believe they may hold information which will assist us with the investigation into his death."
The officer added that the "lone man" seen near the cottage was walking towards Rothienorman.
He is described as about 6ft tall, of average or medium build, wearing dark clothing and possibly a hat.
Det Ch Insp Smith said: "At that time of day in that area, where there is no footpath or street lighting, it would be unusual to see someone in the roadway.
"If that person was you or you know who it was, we would like to hear from you."
Police are still trying to trace two men seen in a burgundy or maroon estate car at Mr McKandie's home between 13:30 and 14:00
The detective said: "These men and the vehicle may have been at the address for perfectly legitimate reasons. Mr McKandie was well known throughout the wider community and a large number of people visited him over many years in relation to his business."
Crimestoppers has been offered a Â£10,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction.
