Brian Andrews, who works as a crossing patrol guard outside the school, said he was "very, very upset" when he heard about Theodore's death.
"A great little guy," he said. "A very happy little chap.
"Absolutely devastated, upset; I felt for his parents and his schoolmates."
One tearful mother taking her child to the school on Monday said everybody was in shock.
"He was such a young little boy and you don't expect it to happen, so we are all very upset," she said.
"We're feeling so sorry for the family."
On Saturday, head teacher Gareth May said the whole school community was "deeply saddened by this tragic event".
Flowers have been left outside the school's gates, with staff and pupils offered support over the coming days.
Anlaby Primary School has about 325 pupils aged between 4 and 11.
