A private funeral service was held earlier for close family and friends in her West Yorkshire constituency.
People applauded and threw flowers as the cortege passed slowly through Heckmondwike and Batley.
Mrs Cox's widower Brendan Cox took to social media earlier to express what he thought her reaction would have been to the terrorist attack in Nice.

Mrs Cox's family said it had been "overwhelmed and touched by the love and support people have shown us".
In a statement released earlier this week, relatives said: "Knowing that so many people share both our grief and our determination to take forward Jo's legacy is a source of great strength at what otherwise feels like a very bleak time.
"Now, particularly for the children, we have decided that Jo's funeral will be a very small and private family affair.
"Anybody from the local community who would like to pay their respects is welcome to gather along the areas outlined as we make this last journey.
"Following this we would ask everyone to respect our privacy to enable us to grieve and rebuild as a family."
Posters appeared around Batley before the funeral featuring a quote from her maiden speech to the House of Commons - "Far more unites us than divides us".
The mother of two young children died on 16 June after she was attacked outside the library in the village of Birstall.
Her killing provoked a wave of shock worldwide and a memorial fund set up by Jo's husband and friends has raised nearly Â£1.5m for organisations she supported.
Mrs Cox had only been an MP for just over a year, having been elected for the Batley and Spen constituency where she grew up, in last year's general election.
Mourners carried white roses - the symbol of Yorkshire - as the funeral cortege passed through the towns of Heckmondwike and Batley.
The flag at Batley Town Hall is also flying at half-mast as a mark of respect.
An inquest in Mrs Cox's death was opened and adjourned last month after hearing she died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds.
Thomas Mair, 52, has appeared at the Old Bailey in central London charged with murdering Mrs Cox.  He is also charged with grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon.
He was remanded in custody and is due to go on trial in November.
