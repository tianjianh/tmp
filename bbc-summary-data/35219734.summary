Final parking zone introduced in Bristol

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The final residents' parking zone (RPZ) has been introduced in Bristol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scheme, introduced by mayor George Ferguson, aims to reduce commuter parking in the city.
Spike Island has become the 16th and final area to have parking restrictions introduced. The first one started in Kingsdown five years ago.
The policy has led to protests and vandalism of some parking machines. Some business owners have said it has damaged trade.
Mr Ferguson said: "The rollout has done what I hoped it would do, with most opposition fading once a scheme goes live, and the majority of residents and traders being pleasantly surprised.
"The feedback we're getting is that parking becomes much easier in the residents' parking zones."
He added that he would ask for the views of local councillors and neighbourhood partnerships before "reconsidering an extension to the scheme".
