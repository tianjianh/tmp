Lancashire v Somerset: Seamers pounce to earn Old Trafford victory

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England's record wicket-taker James Anderson had a key role as Lancashire triggered a Somerset collapse to claim their first win of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Having bowled out Lancashire for 467, to set a target of 295 to win, Somerset looked in contention on 78-2.
But Anderson struck twice in 10 balls to remove ex-England team-mates Marcus Trescothick (36) and Steven Davies.
Ryan McLaren (4-37) and Jordan Clark (3-12) ensured Somerset were then shot out for 130 to lose by 164 runs.
After being bowled out in their first innings for 109, before allowing Somerset to open up a first-innings lead of 169, Lancashire's hopes of getting anything other than three bonus points from the game looked grim when they fell to 23-2 second time around midway through day two.
But a 245-run third-wicket stand between stand-in skipper Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper Alex Davies at least gave them something to bowl at.
And, after lunching on 29-0, seven wickets went down for 78 runs in the afternoon session, including the key wicket of James Hildreth - lbw to McLaren for 43 -  to set up victory.
Sparked by Anderson's brilliant spell, only Hildreth and Trescothick made double figures as Somerset, coached by native Lancastrian Matt Maynard, suffered a second successive defeat.
