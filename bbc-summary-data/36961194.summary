[SN]TITLE[SN]
Celtic 5-0 Motherwell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic thundered into the League Cup quarter-finals with a five-goal pummelling of beleaguered Motherwell.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Rogic scored two, the first a thumping volley. So did Moussa Dembele - one from the penalty spot.
Scott Sinclair got his second goal on his first start for his new club. This was Celtic at their ruthless best.
For Motherwell boss Mark McGhee, the only blessing was the scoreline wasn't even uglier. Only keeper Craig Samson's excellence prevented double figures.
They conceded seven the last time they visited Celtic Park in May. Their survivors from that team would have had flashbacks.
Celtic were inspired, principally, by the wonderful Sinclair and Rogic. Those two were relentless all night and rendered redundant Leigh Griffiths' absence through suspension.
Sinclair was a dervish and Rogic a classy menace. The pair of them were nightmarish handfuls for Motherwell. The Australian played in behind Dembele and the whole thing clicked from the get-go. James Forrest had his moments up there as well.
Motherwell played five at the back, but they might have played 15 back there and it wouldn't have made much difference.
They were behind after 20 minutes. Sinclair had already gone close, but when Callum McGregor dinked a chip over the Motherwell defence and into Rogic, you knew what was coming next.
Rogic had time and space to take it down, turn and rifle his shot past Samson.
Celtic kicked on from there. Sinclair sparked a counter-attack, Rogic had a shot saved by Samson, then Dembele smacked the rebound off the crossbar before Rogic followed up to force another save from Samson.
The Motherwell goalkeeper was outstanding but was helpless when Dembele doubled the lead from the spot after Sinclair was taken down in the box by Richard Tait.
Samson was at it again soon after, making another double save from Sinclair and Rogic.
Sinclair should have scored early in the second half. So, too, Dembele, who curled a shot over after terrific build-up play by Rogic and Sinclair.
There were only occasional signs of a threat from Motherwell, quickly snuffed out by another torrent of Celtic goals.
Sinclair cut inside from the left and pinged his shot into Samson's top corner for the third, then Dembele got his second from close-range with the help of a slight deflection.
Rogic wrapped it up after Forrest drove in from the left and fired at Samson, who could only parry it into the Australian's path.
In the closing stages, Brendan Rodgers brought on some of his youth to add more feel-good for the home fans - 17-year-old Anthony Ralston and 19-year-old Jamie McCart entering what was long since a rout.
Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers: "In the first half some of our attacking game at speed was excellent and in the second half we counter-pressed very well, which allowed us to create more chances.
"All round from the first minute to the end it was fantastic. The level of performance at this stage of the season was very good.
"Scott Sinclair will make other players better.  We are very fortunate to have him. He is a Premier League player down south. He is so fast and dynamic, and gets you off your feet. He had a wonderful first game here."
Motherwell boss Mark McGhee:  "We were totally outclassed.  Celtic were flying, [Tom] Rogic and their wide players were brilliant at times, but we weren't as good as we can be.
"There was a lot of energy expended just chasing them and whenever we did win the ball back, we weren't able to keep it for long because we were fatigued.
"We have to move on quickly.  St Johnstone on Saturday will be a difficult game but it will be different from tonight."
