Vidot, 26, joined Salford in November 2015 and the Samoa international scored six tries in 10 games during an injury-affected season.
The former Brisbane three-quarter also had a trial with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2015.
"We understand that family is hugely important," head coach Ian Watson said.
"Daniel provides a lot for his loved ones, and we were never going to stand in his way when he said he wanted to go back."
Vidot added: "I've really enjoyed my time here, it wasn't an easy season with injuries but I really gave it my best shot.
"It's a decision made purely for my own reasons and has nothing to do with anyone at the club."
