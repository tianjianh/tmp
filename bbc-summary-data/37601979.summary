Scottish company insolvencies 'rise sharply'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Prolonged economic uncertainty led to a sharp rise in the number of Scottish business failures this summer, according to a new report.

Professional services firm KPMG found corporate insolvency appointments increased year-on-year by 30%, to 230, in the three months to 30 September.
However, the number was 14% down on the figure for the previous three months.
Administration appointments, which usually involve larger businesses, increased by 42% to 27.
There was also a 28% increase in liquidation appointments, to 203.
Blair Nimmo, head of restructuring for KPMG in the UK, said: "Business failures continue to rise amidst well documented challenges facing the oil and gas sector and as a result of sustained uncertainty caused by the EU referendum.
"While it would be easy to blame an immediate post-Brexit rise in insolvencies directly on the result of the vote in June, in reality the statistics are more reflective of the long-term impact uncertainty has had on the economy in the past 12 months or so.
"This is evidenced by the fact total corporate appointments from July to September actually fell in comparison to the quarter immediately prior to the referendum. A similar trend was seen in the lead up to and following the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014."
He added: "In order to continue to grow and thrive in a post-Brexit environment, companies must ensure they plan appropriately so they can adapt to any changes in market conditions, particularly those who trade with the EU."
