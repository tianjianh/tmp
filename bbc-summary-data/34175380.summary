Hannah Stubbs, 22, died at her family home in Stafford on 29 August.
A man was questioned after an alleged attack around March and a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider charges.
The Keele University student died "following a long period battling depression", her mother Amanda said.
"We wanted to give her the world, but now God has given her heaven," Miss Stubbs' mother told friends and family members on Facebook, adding: "We would appreciate your prayers".
Staffordshire Police is investigating the death and said a report surrounding the circumstances was being prepared for the coroner.
Speaking for the family, Miss Stubbs' aunt, the Reverend Sally Smith, said life would "never be the same again" for her family or friends.
She said "Hannah could not face returning to university" because of the chance she might meet her alleged attacker.
"In any other organisation... a person would be suspended, if there was an allegation made, until the investigation was completed and I would like to see that same thing happen in universities," she said.
"In Hannah's case, if things had been dealt with differently she could well be here today, continuing her studies and looking forward to a life as a physiotherapist."
Keele University said it was deeply saddened to learn of Miss Stubbs' "tragic death".
In a statement the university said: "The welfare and wellbeing of our students are a priority for the university and we provided support throughout this case.
"We work closely with appropriate authorities and professional support agencies from the earliest opportunity."
