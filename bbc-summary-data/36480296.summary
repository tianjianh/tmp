Giovanbattista Venditti: Newcastle winger makes Zebre return

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newcastle Falcons winger Giovanbattista Venditti has returned to Italian side Zebre after just one season.

The 26-year-old moved to the Premiership last summer from Zebre but was restricted to nine appearances.
"His relative lack of first-team opportunities during his time with us had started to affect his place in the Italian national side," said director of rugby Dean Richards.
"With that in mind, this opportunity has come around at a good time."
