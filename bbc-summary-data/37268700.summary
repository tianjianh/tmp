The body of the man, believed to be in his 20s, was discovered by people walking in Rahin Woods, near Carbury, at about 20:45 local time on Friday.
It was partially buried and covered by undergrowth near two trails through the woods.
Police said they believed the man died violently.
It is believed that the man's body was in the woods for less than a month.
