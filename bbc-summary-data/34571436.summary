Xi Jinping visit: UK royals and MPs to greet Chinese leader

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Members of the Royal Family and politicians are due to greet China's President Xi Jinping at the start of his four-day state visit to the UK.

He and his wife, Peng Liyuan, will take part in a procession down the Mall to Buckingham Palace later, ahead of a state banquet held by the Queen.
Mr Xi will also address both Houses of Parliament and meet PM David Cameron and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The PM's spokeswoman said "nothing is off the table" in talks with Mr Xi.
She said she expected China's dumping of cheap steel on the world market - blamed by UK industry figures for collapsing prices and subsequent job cuts - and the threat from cyber attacks to come up during two planned rounds of "substantial" talks.
The trip, the first UK state visit by a Chinese leader since 2005, has been hailed by officials from both countries as the start of a "golden era" of relations.
The UK Treasury hopes to make China Britain's second biggest trading partner within 10 years.
Chinese companies are to be allowed to take a stake in British nuclear power plants, and a trip by Mr Xi and Mr Cameron to Manchester later in the week is expected to see the announcement of further investment into the so-called Northern Powerhouse project.
But the visit comes as China's economy grew by just 6.9% in the third quarter, the weakest rate since the global financial crisis.

The president will begin Tuesday by being greeted at the Royal Mandarin Hotel in London by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall.
He will then inspect a guard of honour at Horse Guards Parade, where he and his wife will also be given a ceremonial welcome by the Queen and Duke Of Edinburgh.
A state carriage procession will then take place down a flag-decked Mall to Buckingham Palace.
Mr Xi will later travel to Westminster where he will address MPs and Lords at the Palace of Westminster.
He will then visit Clarence House for a further engagement with Prince Charles and the Duchess Of Cornwall, before arriving back at Buckingham Palace for meetings with the Duke Of Cambridge and, afterwards, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The Queen will round off the day by hosting a state banquet in the president's honour, which will be attended by members of the Royal Family, including Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Mr Cameron and Mr Corbyn.
Prince Charles, a friend of the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama, will not be attending, but no official reason has been given for his absence.
China's ambassador to the UK has said he doubts Mr Corbyn will raise the issue of human rights at the banquet, but the Labour leader's spokesman said he would be "using the opportunity" of Mr Xi's visit to raise his concerns.
Amnesty International and other groups have announced their intention to hold protests during the visit over censorship and human rights violations in China.
It is also expected that there will also be a pro-China rally.
