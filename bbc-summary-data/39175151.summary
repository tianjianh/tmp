Biggar has started all of Wales' 2017 Six Nations games, while Davies came on as a replacement in Italy and Scotland.
Davies played an instrumental role as Ospreys beat Edinburgh to initally go top of the Pro12 on Friday.
"He's the people's favourite at the minute and I really like him," Gough told BBC Scrum V.
He continued: "I like the way he plays and what he does but I can't see him uprooting Dan Biggar for the Ireland game.
"I'd like to see it but I think they will go with Dan again."
Davies, who won his fifth Wales cap in their Six Nations defeat by Scotland last time round, is yet to make his first start for his country.
Gough added: "I'd like to see Liam [Williams] at full-back and Sam at 10 because they are the best attackers I think we've got at the moment.
"Dan's a fantastic player and against Ireland, you could throw Sam in against them with their pedigree."
