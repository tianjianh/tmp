Michael Galvin: Judicial inquiry to be established into police officer's death

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish Justice Minister, Frances Fitzgerald, is to establish an independent judicial inquiry into the matters surrounding the death of a police sergeant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sergeant Michael Galvin, based in Donegal, killed himself at Ballyshannon police station on 28 May.
He was being investigated by the police ombudsman over his statement about a woman's death in a traffic accident.
The ombudsman has announced it is shutting down its own investigation.
In a statement, reported on RTÃ‰ , it said it had been listening to the concerns of Sgt Galvin's family, colleagues and public commentary.
It said while much of it had been misleading, inaccurate and inflammatory it did have the potential to damage public confidence in the police oversight system.
It added: "We were aware of the possibility of our investigation becoming compromised due to our prior engagement with Sgt Galvin.
"Following our consultations today, we have come to believe that we need stronger vindication of the appropriateness of our interactions with Sgt Galvin. We are therefore calling on the Minister for Justice to consider a Section 109 investigation. In other words, appointing a judicial figure to examine our interaction.
"We do not believe it is reasonably practicable for us to continue with our investigation," the statement added.
Ms Fitzgerald welcomed the fact that the police ombudsman had discontinued its own investigation into the death of Sgt Galvin.
Earlier the Garda Representative Association, which represents more than 10,000 rank and file police officers in the Republic of Ireland, said that the police ombudsman should not be involved in the investigation.
