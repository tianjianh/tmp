Paramedics are using bicycles to get to callouts quicker in Cardiff city centre.

They responded to seven incidents last weekend and five first responders are using pedal-power again on Saturday as the city hosts big crowds with Wales' rugby and football teams in action.
The service could be rolled out in other areas, according to the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust.
"I'm sure this will save lives in the city centre," said boss Richard Lee.
It could also help to avoid sending an emergency ambulance if suitable treatment can be administered on scene in city centre locations like pedestrianised areas.
Bob Tooby, head of the ambulance's operations in Cardiff & Vale, said: "We have tested the bikes across the Vale of Glamorgan and are already in discussion to expand their use across other areas around Wales over the next three years.
"Early results are promising with the new bikes having been tested last weekend during the Wales v Australia international, and the team responded to seven calls in the busy city centre and Cardiff Bay."
The service is already in operation elsewhere in the UK and St John Ambulance have had cycle responders for several years.
