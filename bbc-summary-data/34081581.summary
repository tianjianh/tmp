Saido Berahino: Tottenham manager likens pursuit to love

Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has likened his club's pursuit of West Brom striker Saido Berahino to a frustrated love affair.

Spurs have had two offers for Berahino rejected by West Brom, who say the player, 22, will not be sold.
"It's like when you are in love with some lady," Pochettino said. "There are a lot of women around the world, but you want only one.
"Sometimes it is impossible. It's about love. And in football it is the same."
Tottenham are in talks to sign Bayer Leverkusen and South Korea forward Son Heung-min, with the proposed transfer reportedly worth 30m euros (Â£22m).
But West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace has told Berahino he will not be allowed to join another side during this transfer window.
The England Under-21 international was dropped last weekend, with boss Tony Pulis saying the player was not in the right frame of mind to play.
Peace said: "I have informed Saido that he will not be transferred during this summer window and that he is staying."
The Burundi-born forward, who progressed through the youth ranks at West Brom, scored 20 goals last term.
In a statement on the Premier League club's website, Peace added: "As I have made clear from the moment Tottenham lodged their first bid for Saido on 18 August, selling our top goalscorer was never on our agenda this summer.
"Not only have the offers been too low as a valuation of the player, but they have been based on stage-payments and add-ons over a long period which do nothing to reflect Saido's ability and potential.
"I have the greatest respect for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy but he must surely appreciate we would have needed to replace Saido had he left and no consideration of that position has been reflected by Tottenham's strategy."
