[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean McConville scored a stoppage-time winner to earn Accrington a dramatic win over Doncaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
League Two new boys Rovers should have had a dream start in the first minute when Stanley goalkeeper Aaron Chapman bundled over Matty Blair in the area.
But the keeper redeemed himself, diving low to his right to save Andy Williams' penalty and then scrambling away the follow-up.
Stanley, who finished fourth in the last campaign, edged ahead on eight minutes when Scott Brown played through Rommy Boco, who was one-on-one with keeper Ross Etheridge, and he slotted home the opener.
Rovers had not been behind for long when Tommy Rowe weaved his way into the area before firing home from 10 yards on 12 minutes.
Doncaster should have been comfortably ahead, with Andy Butler squandering two great chances.
Stanley made them pay on 29 minutes when defender Matty Pearson got the ball 30 yards out and unleashed a fierce shot into the bottom.
Doncaster dominated possession after the break but it was Stanley's McConville who came close, heading against the post.
With eight minutes left, sub Liam Mandeville's cross was slotted home by Williams as Doncaster thought they had rescued a point.
But there was more drama as former Manchester United and Burnley midfielder Chris Eagles sent McConville in for the winner, which he curled into the far corner of the net in the first minute of added time.
