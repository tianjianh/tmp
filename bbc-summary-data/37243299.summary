Dumfriesshire MSP Oliver Mundell is seeking urgent talks with the administrators appointed at armoured vehicle firm Penman Engineering.

He said any job losses at their site near Dumfries would have "significant negative effects" on the community.
Administrators Armstrong Watson was appointed on Wednesday.
The firm said it was focused on allowing the business to continue to trade while it sought a sale to preserve the "maximum number of jobs".
When they took over, administrators said there were currently 140 staff employed by the firm.
"This is hugely worrying news for the workers at Penman and their families who rely on the jobs at the site," Mr Mundell said.
"I am very committed to working closely with the appointed administrators who I'm looking to meet within the coming days to ensure workers are protected and that a buyer can be found as quickly as possible for the business.
"My priority right now is to ensure that jobs are protected at the site in the event of any sale to make sure Penman Engineering remain a major employer in the area."
The Unite union said it would work hard to protect the jobs of its members at the firm.
Regional officer Paul Neilson said: "This is a worrying time for our members at Penman Engineering.
"In the coming days and weeks, we will support them, and will work hard to ensure that their rights are respected in this process.
"We will also work hard to protect their jobs."
He said they would "work constructively" with the company and the administrators and called on local politicians to help find a buyer.
"Scotland can't afford to lose more high-skilled jobs from the manufacturing sector, and Dumfries and Galloway can't afford another blow to its economy," he said.
