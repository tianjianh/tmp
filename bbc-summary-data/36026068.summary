The 20-year-old, the youngest prop to play for Scotland in half a century, won his first cap as a replacement in the Six Nations against England.
"I love the club and I feel we're going places," he told the Warriors website.
"The club and [coach] Gregor (Townsend) have showed a lot of faith in me and I want to repay them for that. I feel my game is coming along nicely."
Fagerson, a former national junior mountain bike champion,  made his Glasgow debut against Benetton Treviso last season and has gone on to make 29 appearances for the club, scoring two tries.
The Perth-born tight-head was called into Scotland's Six Nations squad and won his first cap, against England at Murrayfield, before returning to the Under-20s squad.
He joins a host of fellow Scottish internationals including Jonny Gray, Finn Russell, Ryan Wilson and Rob Harley in committing his future to the Warriors, who will also welcome former All Blacks hooker Corey Flynn and Italy wing Leonardo Sarto in the summer.
"Although I am nowhere near the finished article I'm continually growing and developing as a player," Fagerson added.
"Working with [Glasgow forwards coach] Dan (McFarland) and being involved with Scotland has helped my scrummaging and the technical aspects of the game.
"I'm getting better with each game I play and I can't wait for the next three years."
Warriors assistant coach Kenny Murray said that Fagerson's emergence was further proof of a fine youth system.
"He is another great product of the Glasgow rugby academy and has a fantastic career ahead of him," he said.
"He still has a lot of learning to do, but he has a great opportunity to learn and he will be a great asset to the team."
