[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hull FC eased into the Challenge Cup quarter-finals as Steve Michaels scored a hat-trick against Catalans.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 2016 cup winners totally dominated the first half and scored six tries.
Michaels went over twice and there were also tries for Josh Griffin, Mahe Fonua, Liam Watts and Scott Taylor.
Hull's 28-0 half-time lead was extended when Michaels spectacularly completed his treble, while Jansin Turgut, Jordan Thompson, Jake Connor and two from Jamie Shaul wrapped up the victory.
Catalans had no answer to Hull, who beat Warrington in last year's final to lift the trophy for the first time.
Hull opened the scoring with a free-flowing move which was finished off by Michaels in the left-hand corner, while Shaul and Mark Minichiello combined to set up Griffin.
Fonua went over in the corner, Watts spotted a gap in the Catalans defence to run to the side of the posts and Michaels took Turgut's pass to score his second try.
Great work from Watts and Albert Kelly freed Taylor as Hull romped to a 28-point lead at the break.
Michael's dived over acrobatically in the corner for his third try and Turgut collected a short pass to grab his second try in Hull colours.
Kelly's clever offload saw Thompson go over, Shaul scored two late tries on his 100th career appearance and Connor grabbed a try to go with his 10 points from the boot to complete the rout.
Hull coach Lee Radford:
"It was exactly what we asked for. It ended up being a difficult evening with the injuries but the blokes that jumped in did a really good job.
"I thought Jordan Thompson epitomised that. He had one of the best games he's played this year and in an alien position and Washy played about five positions tonight.
"It was a real cabbage-patch team at the end but everybody played their role really well. We spoke beforehand about knockout football being important to us and we were pretty close to our best."
Catalans Dragons coach Laurent Frayssinous:
"It was men against boy. Defensively and offensively they were way too good for us, it's as simple as that. There are a few harsh and good lessons for our kids to learn.
"Losing Richie Myler and Julian Bousquet, two more of our experienced players, made it even tougher. We had a lack of interchanges because of the injuries.
"The Challenge Cup has finished for us and it's finished in a tough way. The cup was a goal for us and we wanted to put out our best team."
