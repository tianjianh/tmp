The son of a man who died in the Shoreham air disaster has vowed to complete a bungee jump in his honour after it was postponed.

Luke Reeves, 28, from Surrey, had intended to jump 300ft (91m) - a feat his dad dreamed of but never got to do - on Sunday.
Mark Reeves, 53, died when a vintage jet plummeted onto the A27 in West Sussex on 22 August, killing 11 people.
He had carried out skydives and abseils himself in aid of Cancer Research.
"Nothing really scared him," he said.
"I could not stand on top of our house without feeling like I'm going to fall off and my knees going weak.
"But he always wanted to do a bungee and he never got to tick that off, so I said to my other half I'm going to do a bungee for dad."
First, Mr Reeves found one at 150ft (46m), but he said his father would have done something better.
"So we found one for 300ft and it looks like I'm doing that," he said.
Luke said he had set up a fundraising page with a Â£409.61 target, because his father's birthday was 4 September 1961. He has already surpassed that target.
He had to call off the attempt due to "technical problems".
