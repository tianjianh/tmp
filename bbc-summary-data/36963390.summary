A prisoner sent a thank-you note to custody staff at a police station praising them for showing her "respect and dignity".

The handwritten letter was sent to Cheadle Heath custody suite in Stockport, Greater Manchester, after the woman's two-day stay last month.
She said it was "the first time I ever had respect of police" despite "many weekend bang ups".
Staff were "surprised" to receive the letter of praise, police said.
Supt Chris Hankinson, from Greater Manchester Police, said: "Our priority is to ensure [people who end up in custody] get the support they need and staff work tirelessly in incredibly difficult circumstances.
"I'm grateful this lady took the time to thank the staff and I hope her next encounter with GMP is equally as pleasant, but on the right side of the custody door."
