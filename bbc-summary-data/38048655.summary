Gareth Southgate: England interim boss completes interview

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Southgate's three-hour interview for the permanent England manager's job has finished and is understood to have gone smoothly, although no announcement is expected until 30 November.

The 46-year-old, who has just concluded a four-game stint as interim manager following Sam Allardyce's departure, is the only candidate.
The England Under-21 coach was interviewed by a five-person panel but no announcement is expected until any appointment is ratified at a full FA board meeting at the end of the month.
The panel comprised FA chairman Greg Clarke, chief executive Martin Glenn, technical director Dan Ashworth, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson and former England defender Graeme Le Saux.
"The FA has to be seen to be going through the process," ex-FA chief executive Mark Palios told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
"Maybe it is a process to iron out some things they expect of an England manager, so it is more of a briefing for Southgate than an interview.
"Everyone knows Gareth. They know him from around the FA, they know him through his involvement with the under-21s."
Meanwhile, it appears unlikely the FA will take action against England and Liverpool midfielders Jordan Henderson and Adam Lallana after reports they visited a strip club while on international duty.
The pair allegedly made the trip a day after a World Cup qualifying win over Scotland and less than three days before a draw in a friendly with Spain.
The FA is declining to comment.
Southgate has left England top of their World Cup qualifying group after victories against Malta and Scotland and a goalless draw in Slovenia.
His last game as interim manager almost resulted in a win over Spain but England were denied victory by two late goals.
England next play in March, with a friendly against World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund, followed by a home qualifier against Lithuania.
It is also understood the FA did not tell England captain Wayne Rooney to apologise over "inappropriate" pictures of him at a wedding at the team hotel during the same international break.
The Sun newspaper published images it said showed Rooney drunk at a party late on Saturday night - a day after the 3-0 win over Scotland on 11 November.
Rooney "unreservedly" apologised to interim England manager Gareth Southgate after pictures emerged.
The 31-year-old Manchester United striker has since branded reaction to his late-night conduct as "disgraceful" and vowed he is "not finished yet".
The FA, which is also looking into claims several players were out until late after the Scotland game, has now banned England players from having nights out while on international duty.
It is believed that Henderson, who was captain for the 2-2 draw with Spain at Wembley, and Lallana, did not break an FA players' code of conduct, which is seen as a set of guidelines rather than specific rules.
