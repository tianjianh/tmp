Sinfield played more than 500 games for Leeds between 1997 and 2015, and spent a year with rugby union side Yorkshire Carnegie before retiring in May.
The 35-year-old's new role includes helping create the England team's four-year plan for the 2021 World Cup.
He will also work with the RFL's commercial team to help players find new careers after their retirement.
"The 20 years Kevin has spent as a player at the very highest level of the game will provide us with incredible insight," RFL chief executive Nigel Wood said.
"He is determined to make as much of a difference off the pitch to the sport as he did on it."
