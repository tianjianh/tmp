The 2013 world champion missed out on an Olympic medal at Rio 2016.
The 28-year-old finished fourth, losing out to British teammate and then house-mate Vicky Holland for the bronze medal.
"The disappointment from Rio has made me determined to do better next time," Stanford said.
"It could come down to me and Vicky competing for a medal again. Hopefully this time it will be for two medals and not just one."
The Gold Coast Commonwealth Games start on 4 April 2018 and organisers decided to re-structure the triathlon event.
The distances in the event now consist of a 750m swim, 20km bike and 5km run instead of the Olympic distances which are double in length.
Swansea-born Stanford admits the different distances will be a disadvantage to her.
"In Glasgow, you had a situation; a lot of the smaller countries were lapped out especially in the swim," Stanford added.

"I think they are hoping by shorting the distance, they will make it more competitive.
"I really enjoy the sprint distance but I think I am better suited to the Olympic distance.
"It will be really different and throw up a few different challenges but exciting all the same."
Stanford missed the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow because of a stress fracture in her left ankle.
The former Under-23 World Champion wants "nothing more" than to achieve success in the Gold Coast Games.
"I was devastated to miss out last time in Glasgow due to injury," said Stanford.
"The Commonwealth Games has always been on my radar, even before the Olympics.
"So it has always been a lifelong ambition of mine to represent Wales on that stage
Stanford will begin her World Triathlon Series campaign in Yokohoma, Japan in May as the preparation process begins for qualification for next April's Commonwealth Games.
