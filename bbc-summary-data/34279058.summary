Rhodes interview: How I conquered my fear of singing in public

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two years ago, Rhodes was too nervous to sing in front of 20 people. Now he's performing to thousands. He tells the BBC how he overcame his fears and signed a record deal.

When we meet, Rhodes has just wrapped up a Live Lounge performance at Radio 1 - playing a dramatic cover of Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do to millions of listeners around the UK.
Sat behind a piano, he is so in command of the studio it is hard to believe that, two years ago, he couldn't bear for anyone to hear his voice.
"I'd always played guitar and I just thought that was going to be my thing," he says after the broadcast, sipping a glass of water in Radio 1's green room.
His fear of singing began at a young age, after he heard his voice on cassette.
"Me and my friend used to make radio stations when we were kids and we'd make up characters and things," he explains. "I had a really high voice... and I just couldn't bear the sound of it.
"I decided I wasn't going to sing, that I wouldn't be able to. I didn't think it was loud enough, and I didn't think it was coming out the way I wanted it to. So I just thought, 'I love playing guitar, I'll be a guitarist.'"
Born David Rhodes in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, the musician spent his teenage years playing in bands - alternating between guitar and bass - until his family stuck their noses in.
"I was writing soundscapes, because I was really into the way music can make you feel, without words," he explains. "And my dad said to me, 'I love the music but it needs words.'"
So his father staged an intervention of sorts - plying his son with drinks ("10 or over," laughs Rhodes) at a party, before persuading him to come on stage and play Robert Johnson's Crossroads.
"My dad really wanted me to sing with him," he recalls. "It was just to about 20 of his friends in the back garden, but that gave me the confidence to know that I could get a microphone and sing into it and it would sound nice.
"It ended up being a really fond memory. I can mark that first singing experience now."
Satisfied that his voice wouldn't force people to stick knives in their ears, Rhodes left for London and started recording demos on his laptop.
His girlfriend, Inca, who he met working at American Apparel, happened to know Johnny LeVan-Gilroy, head of Hometown Records, from her schooldays. Very soon, LeVan-Gilroy was his manager, and his music was being played on Radio 1.
"It's one of those things where it's a bit of luck - but a lot of hard work as well," says the singer now.
But striking out on his own also meant abandoning the band he'd been playing with for several years.
"They were my best friends, my absolute brothers," he says. "Walking away from that was incredibly hard - and they didn't like it, they didn't want me to go.
"But I think I had to. I had to do that. I wanted to experiment with something new and try my hand at writing my own songs. But I don't like hurting people."
Those friends rallied around when they saw how successful Rhodes was becoming, with a string of well-received EPs and support slots for the likes of Sam Smith and London Grammar.
It all comes to a head this week, when the singer-songwriter releases his debut album, Wishes.
A moving and evocative record, it deals with human frailty and self-doubt, while the arrangements soar and spiral to suggest salvation.
"I like a big chorus," he laughs, "and the songs do grow from something small to something big, mostly. But that's the way I like doing it. It's effective because you can create that cinematic grandeur."
"But even though the songs are quite big, musically, there's not much going on," he adds. "It's guitar and voice - and that's the way my songs always started in my room."
The album was recorded in the first half of the year in Yorkshire, where his producer James Kenosha has a studio "on the seaside in a massive farmhouse".
"It's his family home," Rhodes explains. "They've got beautiful dogs and a beautiful cat and his mum and dad were amazing. They kept us fed for six months."
The relaxed atmosphere meant the sessions could progress at their own pace.
"In the studio it was very improvised. We had a piano, a guitar and a drum kit and we got a guy in to do all the strings. But it was only one guy - he'd play the violin and if we wanted to make a cello sound, we'd just pitch it down. It was all very minimal."
Lyrics "were the last thing I tackled," the singer admits, but he was fortunate to have a notebook of thoughts and phrases he's kept since he was young.
"My mum got me into writing down my dreams when I was a kid," he says. "I was having nightmares, so she just left a notebook under my bed. It was a therapeutic thing to do and I've always written down my thoughts as a result.
"But they're not lyrics, or poems, or anything like that, so it was quite hard for me to structure them that way."
Eventually, he drew inspiration from his love of Delta Blues, utilising a repetition "that's like hypnotism" to explore his themes of overcoming fears and supporting your loved ones.
One of the most affecting songs on the album is Breathe, written for a friend who was suffering depression.
"Are you holding your breath again?" he sings, gently, before reassuring: "Come on now - I'll keep you warm. Never give up."
"It's about that feeling of being about to burst," he says. "When you feel like that, it's important to have someone there, even if you don't really want them there."
The 25-year-old is gentle and considerate, even in the slightly heightened atmosphere of Radio 1. Does he often find himself being a shoulder to cry on?
"When people need to," he says. "Not all the time. But I'm there for people, and there are people that are there for me.
"I just think it's important to let each other know."
Wishes is out now on Rhodes Music / Ministry of Sound Recordings.
