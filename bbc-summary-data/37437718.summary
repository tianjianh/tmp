Seven-mile queues following M8 accident

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers have faced a seven-mile tailback after an early morning accident on the M8 in Glasgow caused damage to a bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The accident, involving a Jaguar which struck a bridge barrier, happened at 05:45 at Junction 18 Charing Cross in the city.
The affected lane and slip road reopened at 09:00 following repairs.
Police said a 38-year-old man had been taken by ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary following the crash.
His condition was not thought to be life-threatening.
Traffic Scotland had warned drivers that the route was likely to remain shut through the early morning rush hour.
The delays affected traffic from Glasgow Airport and drivers on the M77 from Junction 5.
At one point, the tailback stretched as far back as Junction 29, St James Interchange.
The queues had largely dissipated by mid morning but traffic was slower than usual.
