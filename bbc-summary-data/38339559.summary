A village recreated entirely in cake - including a tiny cake shop - has raised more than £5,000.

Youlgrave in Derbyshire was crafted by villager Lynne Nolan in icing with neighbours baking 35 cakes.
Organisers said they had been surprised but delighted by the national media attention the story inspired.
The auction of the cakes raised £3,000 on the night with another £2,000 coming in from donations. All proceeds are going towards the church roof appeal.

The model consisted of 16 detailed buildings including a pub and church,  with the icing alone taking 387 hours to apply.
The cakes have been soaked in whiskey which preserves them for months.
Mrs Nolan, who is a keen cake maker, said: "I think the butcher is my favourite.
"I did it first and it has got black puddings and pork pies and cuts of meat in it."
Ian Bright, one of the team behind the project, said: "We have had a lot of media attention. We have had reporters from lots of papers, TV cameras and of course it has travelled the world on the internet.
"One man who paid £1,000 for some of the cakes promptly donated them back and they will be divided up for elderly and needy people.
"As well as the cake auction money we have had donations from all over the country."
