An app to help people living with dementia reclaim their memories will be trialled as part of a new project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Book of You allows patients and their carers to create a digital life story book using photos, words, music and film and encourages conversations about their lives.
It has been developed by a Denbighshire firm and backed by Bangor University.
It will be piloted for three months as part of an initiative study to support people with dementia and their carers.
Prof Bob Woods, from the Dementia Services Development Centre Wales at Bangor University, said the project was a "landmark step forward in the battle to defeat dementia".
Developed by The Book of You CIC, the app is one of two chosen for the UK-wide study by the innovation foundation Nesta as part of its Dementia Citizens project.
While creating the story book, carers and dementia patients will be asked questions about their memories, while the app gathers day-to-day data to understand and address key issues in care.
About 45,000 people in Wales are thought to be living with dementia, with Alzheimer's the most common form of the illness.
