Rowan Williams takes St Endellion Church volunteer role

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams is to become a volunteer at a Cornwall church.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Baron Williams of Oystermouth was invited to take up the role of prebend by the Bishop of Truro, the Right Reverend Tim Thornton.
Two years ago Dr Williams nominated the church in north Cornwall as his favourite church in the UK.
The post will see him take an active role in helping the church's activities such as the Endelienta arts festival.
The church already has four prebends, who support the church "as a spiritual centre and a place of artistic endeavour".
Dr Williams said: "I first visited the church when I was a student back in 1970 when I was walking with some friends.
"It was just overwhelming, the sense of a great light-filled granite cave. I fell in love it with it very seriously.
"There's something about the granite - the toughness and the sparkle."
Dr Williams, who lives in Cambridge, added: "I don't think they expect me to turn up to every meeting, but it is wonderful to have that link.
"I hope there will be an opportunity to come and share in worship and maybe to preach."
Bishop Thornton said: "I am delighted that Rowan has accepted this invitation and we look forward to his participation in the life and work of St Endellion and its festivals of music, art and poetry.
"In becoming a prebend, he will join in the vision for St Endellion as place of mission and where engagement with people through spirituality and the arts explores the meaning and nature of life."
Dr Williams will be installed at a ceremony later this year.
David Cameron's daughter born in 2010 was named Florence Rose Endellion after the village, which is a favourite of the prime minister.
