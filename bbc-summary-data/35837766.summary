[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Winger Alison Miller scored three tries and full-back Niamh Briggs got two while Liz Burke, Ciara Griffen and Sophie Spence also touched down.
The Irish women are likely to finish in third place, having lost to the winners France and runners-up England.
Jenny Maxwell got Scotland's first try just before half-time with Rhona Lloyd scoring the second right at the end.
Sunday's result made it a sixth successive Six Nations campaign without a win for the Scots.
Last year Ireland won 73-3 away in Scotland.
Ireland now turn their thoughts to preparing for the Women's Sevens Olympic Repechage tournament in Dublin on 25 and 26 June.
The hosts will compete against 15 other nations for the one final place at the Olympics in August.
The winners of the tournament will join New Zealand, Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Colombia, USA, France, Fiji, Japan and hosts Brazil in Rio.
