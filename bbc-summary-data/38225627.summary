[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Exeter Chiefs suffered a third straight European Champions Cup defeat to stay bottom of Pool Five as Bordeaux-Begles secured victory at Sandy Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A try by 19-year-old Jack Maunder in front of England head coach Eddie Jones gave the hosts an interval lead.
The visitors scored 10 points after the break, including a try by Baptiste Serin, before a controversial finish.
Exeter's James Short had a 70th-minute try ruled out when he was adjudged to have lost control of the ball.
Exeter have two points from three games, their hopes of progressing in the competition all but over.
They enjoyed plenty of possession but paid the price for too many handling errors and failing to convert chances into points.
Exeter started well, Lachlan Turner's slicing through the visitors' defence before his marauding run was brought to an end three metres from the line.
The home side took the lead in the 32nd minute after Maunder latched on to a break by Ollie Devoto.
Fog reduced visibility and the greasy conditions did little to help reduce Exeter's errors.
Bordeaux, 7-3 down at the interval, edged in front through Serin's 57th-minute try and dug deep to secure a vital win.
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter: "We had more opportunities to score but just didn't take them.
"Our frustration at not scoring got the better of us. In the end we gave Bordeaux the chance to go and score their try.
"Mathematically we're not dead but realistically it is going to be hard for us to progress.
Exeter Chiefs are back in action next Saturday when they travel to France for the return fixture (13:00 GMT).
