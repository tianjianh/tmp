Charlton and Northern Ireland striker Josh Magennis out for at least a month

Northern Ireland striker Josh Magennis will be out for at least a month after suffering an ankle injury in Charlton's draw against Millwall on Saturday.

Charlton manager Karl Robinson fears the striker, 26, could be missing for "six or seven" weeks.
"We're looking at a minimum of four weeks. It's one of those ones where we need to see the swelling settle down first," Robinson told BBC Kent.
Northern Ireland next face Norway in a World Cup qualifier on 26 March.
Magennis has scored eight goals since joining Charlton from Kilmarnock last August.
"He's been for a number of scans and what we did note from the first X-ray was that he's had a plate in there from a previous injury so there was an awful lot interference in the X-ray because of the metal he already had around his ankle," added the Charlton boss.
Magennis had to leave the field after only 13 minutes of last weekend's game, which finished in a 0-0 draw.
