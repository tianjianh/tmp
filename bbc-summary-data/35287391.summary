The 27-year-old left the Cherries for Carrow Road in 2014 and has returned on a three-and-a-half-year contract.
After scoring 12 Championship goals last season he has found the net once in six Premier League games this term.
The signing of Grabban comes a day after Bournemouth completed a move for Wolves striker Benik Afobe, taking the club's spending to £16m in 24 hours.
It was initially thought Afobe cost £10m, but that fee is now believed to be £9m.
"I think we'll be getting a better Lewis Grabban," said Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe.
"But he'll realise that we've got better as well and he will have to adapt, too. We're in no doubt we're getting a good player back.
"He's also someone who was popular in the dressing room, behind the scenes he's a strong motivator and we're delighted to be bringing him back.
"It was such a long, drawn-out transfer but we're delighted it's been done."
Bournemouth host Norwich in the Premier League on Saturday.
Grabban, who began his career at Crystal Palace, first joined Bournemouth from Rotherham for £300,000 in May 2012.
In two years on the south coast he scored 35 goals in 86 league appearances before making the move to Norwich, who were promoted alongside Bournemouth last season.
