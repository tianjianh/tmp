[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man was struck by a silver or grey Audi A1 car as he was crossing Greenock Road, near the junction with Kingston Road, at about 21:50 on Saturday.
The car failed to stop and carried on in the direction of Renfrew.
The man was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley where his condition has been described as "serious but stable".
Sgt Kenny Malaney, of Police Scotland, said: "The car failed to stop after it struck the pedestrian and extensive inquiries are ongoing to trace the car involved and its driver. However, officers are following a number of lines of inquiry in relation to this incident.
"I would ask any witnesses to the crash who have not yet spoken to police to come forward, and I would also ask anyone who may have seen a silver or grey Audi A1 being driven in the local area around the time of the crash on Saturday night to contact the divisional road policing unit at Greenock through 101."
