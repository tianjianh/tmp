Thailand murders: Lawyers' concern over key evidence

The lawyers for two men charged with the murder of a pair of British tourists in Thailand have expressed concern that key forensic evidence will not be re-examined before trial.

Two young migrant workers from Myanmar have been accused of the murders of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller.
But the investigation into their deaths has been marred by confusion and allegations of police incompetence.
The backpackers were killed on Koh Tao island in September last year.
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo have both repeatedly stated their innocence.
Their defence lawyers have asked for the forensic evidence gathered by Thai police to be sent to independent experts.
But the judge in the case has said that he will not rule on the matter until the first day of the trial.
"I am now deeply concerned at this developing situation," said lead lawyer Nakhon Chomphuchat in a statement.
"Without re-examination of this evidence by the Ministry of Justice's Central Institute of Forensic Science, the ability of the two defendants to defend themselves against the serious crimes they are charged of will be seriously impeded."
With no witnesses to the murders, forensic analysis is likely to be central in deciding the outcome of the case, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok.
Thai police have described their investigation as "perfect", despite failing to control the crime scene and the flurry of conflicting police statements issued in the first weeks of the investigation, our correspondent says.
In October, both defendants said that they had been beaten by local police into confessing to the murders.
The bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found on a beach in the popular tourist destination on 15 September. Mr Miller died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge died from head wounds.
The victims' families have said they are keen to see the "right people" convicted.
