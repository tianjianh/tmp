[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former head of Swansea University's School of Management has denied he harassed or bullied staff.

Speaking to BBC Wales, Professor Nigel Piercy said he felt he had been the victim rather than the perpetrator.
He spoke after stepping down as dean citing "differences" with the university.
Earlier this year university staff made allegations of harassment and threatening behaviour they had experienced at work.
An internal inquiry was launched as it emerged that some staff had described the school as being run as a "dictatorship".
Questions over why the senior management team had not stepped in sooner were also raised.
In July Prof Piercy stepped aside and two weeks later, his son Niall left his role as pro-dean.
Prof Piercy said prior to his resignation he was unable to respond publicly to any accusations due to university policy.
In the first interview since he stepped down, Prof Piercy told BBC Wales' Newyddion 9 programme for S4C that the intimidation and harassment claims made against him were untrue.
"These are just generic insults that you throw at people hoping that some of it is going to stick if there is a culture of fear," he said.
"I think I am the victim of it rather than the person doing it."
When asked about the allegations which were made against him he replied: "I can't find any evidence to support such accusations and they [the accusers] refuse to provide the evidence and the hide behind anonymity.
"They are stock-in-trade complaints which seem to occur everywhere where major change is being managed."
He did admit that he had "on occasion" used disrespectful language.
"If people want to get involved in that sort of dialogue then I answer in kind," he said.
"I think people are on occasions a little bit too quick to take offence and a little bit too thin-skinned."
Prof Piercy said that he had been brought into the university in February 2013 because "business and economics was somewhat of a shambles" with students being treated like "dirt" and that they were "grateful if somebody could even be bothered to do a lecture."
He said he thought there was "a problem" with some of those at the top of the university in senior management and certain parts of the university council.
"I think the answer is that they should be removed," he said.
He said he was planning on calling for a political inquiry into what he saw as the "mismanagement and politicisation" of Swansea University.
The university has declined to comment as has Sir Roger Jones, the chairman of the university's council.
