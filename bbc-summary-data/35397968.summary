Andrew Tomlinson, 48, and his wife Faye Tomlinson, 54, along with Mandy Deere, 54, were run over and killed on Sutton Road, in the Askern area.
Mrs Deere's husband, John Deere, 57, was left critically ill in hospital.
Ricky Hepworth was remanded in custody at Sheffield Crown Court until 11 April, when he is due to be sentenced.
He admitted three counts of causing death by dangerous driving, one count of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, causing a death while driving uninsured and unlicensed and failing to stop at the scene of a collision.
South Yorkshire Police said he had been driving at 50mph in a 20mph zone.
The Crown Prosecution Service is not proceeding with three counts of aggravated vehicle-taking.
Hepworth, 24, of Newmarche Drive, Askern, was driving a blue Volvo S60 when he struck the four pedestrians.
Sgt Donna Roden said: "A huge hole has been left in the lives of those affected by Hepworth's incredibly irresponsible actions which saw him driving a car without permission, a licence or any insurance.
"I hope in some small part that today's conviction will help the families of those killed and seriously injured begin to rebuild their lives."
