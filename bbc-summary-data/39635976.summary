Plans have been announced to close a fire station in Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Royal Berkshire Fire Authority announced on Tuesday it would close Pangbourne station as part of plans to help it save Â£1.4m.
In the public consultation, the closure of Pangbourne station was the most popular option.
The closure of Wargrave station in Wokingham Borough was deferred for a year, but Pangbourne station in West Berkshire is to close permanently.
The Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said there was a possibility Wargrave station could close if funding was not found elsewhere and if the station, which is currently manned part-time by retained firefighters, did not increase its availability from 2.4% to 60%.
West Berkshire Conservative councillor Emma Webster - who sits on the fire authority, said: "I understand the concerns raised by residents and the local community.
"I think the most important thing that people need to remember is that residents across the whole of Berkshire will remain safe.
"If they need to dial 999 they will get the service they expect in a prompt and timely manner to assist them in their hour of need."
