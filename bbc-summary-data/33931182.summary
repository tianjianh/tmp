The incident, which happened in Bolton at about 10:10 BST on Thursday, was captured on CCTV.
A blue Honda Civic pulled up next to the woman as she walked along Spa Road, next to Queen's Park, police said.
There was a struggle between the two and the woman was apparently forced into the back seat.
Neither the car nor the woman has been found, Greater Manchester Police said.
Officers are now trying to trace a potential witness who appeared to cross the road to avoid the incident.
She was wearing orange clothing and carrying a white bag.
Det Insp Charlotte Cadden said: "At this stage, we do not know the circumstances as to why this car stopped, whether the man and woman were known to each other, or why she would appear to have been forced into the car.
"However, given what we have seen on CCTV we are concerned for the safety and well-being of this woman."
