The small aircraft came down in a field at Steve Powell's farm at Cwmbach, Builth Wells, Powys, just before 12:00 BST on Sunday.
The men from Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, have been named locally as Scott Penlington and Nick Jefferies.
Mr Powell said the aircraft appeared to have "fallen out of the sky into our field".
"It is a terrible tragedy and we've never had anything like this before," he added.
"The police are examining the wreckage but we don't know exactly what happened."
Dyfed Powys Police said recovery work has now been completed and the emergency services left the scene on Tuesday.
A spokesman for the Independent Air Accidents Investigation Branch, which is leading the investigation, said the wreckage was being recovered to its headquarters at Farnborough for a more detailed examination.
He added safety recommendations may be issued to prevent similar accidents in the future, if any issues were identified.
One Direction singer Harry Styles is a family friend of Mr Jefferies after he once dated his daughter Emilie, also 22.
They remained friends with her father taking him up in his single-engine two-seater Cosmik plane.
