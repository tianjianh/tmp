[SN]TITLE[SN]
More North Yorkshire libraries run by volunteers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Volunteers have taken over the running of 21 libraries in North Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The new libraries join nine that are already run by the public.
Twelve other libraries will be run by North Yorkshire County Council, but with volunteer support. More than 1,200 new volunteers will help run the service.
The council said the changes were due to reductions in government funding, with its library budget falling from Â£7.8m in 2010 to Â£4.3m in 2017/18.
Julie Blaisdale, assistant director of library and community services, said: "We knew we were asking a lot when we took the offer to run their own libraries to communities, but we also knew how loved libraries are and how determined people are that they should not only survive, but thrive.
"We knew the commitment and expertise was there within our communities to make this happen."
The council will cover the libraries overheads, as well as providing new books and access to the library management system and broadband access.
