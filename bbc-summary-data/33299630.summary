A record-equalling 10 Britons were among the 198 starters in the Dutch city of Utrecht on Saturday, 4 July.
Time trials, crosswinds, cobbles and six-summit finishes, including one atop l'Alpe d'Huez in the penultimate stage, featured in the 102nd edition which climaxed in Paris on 26 July.
Here's how Team Sky's Froome won the 2015 Tour de France...
Winner: Rohan Dennis (Aus/BMC)
Report: Dennis in yellow with record speed
The people of Utrecht in the Netherlands poured out in their thousands to watch Australian Rohan Dennis record the quickest average speed ever in a Tour de France stage. The BMC rider was five seconds clear of German Tony Martin in the 13.8km time trial, finishing in a record average speed of 55.446 km/h. Meanwhile, Britain's Chris Froome and the other yellow jersey contenders are within 20 seconds of each other.
Winner: Andre Greipel (Ger/Lotto-Soudal)
Report: Froome gains time on rivals
Amid the coastal winds and sporadic rain on the way to Zeeland, there were plenty of talking points. The conditions created a split in the peloton that saw Chris Froome put as much as one minute and 28 seconds between himself and some of his major yellow jersey rivals. Mark Cavendish failed to win a 26th stage, coming up short against Andre Greipel when moving early in the sprint finish. And Fabian Cancellara also beat Cavendish, coming third to claim the yellow jersey.

Another day of drama as two crashes, one involving race leader Fabian Cancellara, forced the race to be neutralised and stopped. When racing resumed, Joaquim Rodriguez proved strongest up the punishing Mur de Huy but the bigger story was Chris Froome gaining more time on his rivals in the race for the overall Tour victory.
Winner: Tony Martin

A stage that promised so much, delivered on excitement, if not on big time gaps between the riders chasing the overall race victory.
