Ospreys captain Alun Wyn Jones says the region must "make the most" of the European Challenge Cup after their demolition of Newcastle Falcons.

Steve Tandy's side thrashed the Falcons 45-0 in their first European fixture of the season on Friday.
"There's a few stages to go through and there's a chance for us to further stretch the squad," said Jones.
"[We can] get the guys more exposure in a European setting but obviously not the one we want to be in."
The Welsh region were playing in Europe's second-tier tournament for the first time, having spent their previous 13 seasons playing European Cup and Champions Cup rugby.
Prior to the victory on Friday, Ospreys had won only one of their last 11 encounters against English teams in European competition, which came against Exeter Chiefs in November 2015.
"We've got to make the most of the opportunity. With the squad, we've had depth before but not strength in depth," Jones told BBC Wales Sport.
"We have got a little more of that now so hopefully we get some more opportunities in this competition.
"In the past we've frontloaded the season with a lot of guys who seem to drop off, particularly at international times. It's been a balancing act for Steve [Tandy]."
