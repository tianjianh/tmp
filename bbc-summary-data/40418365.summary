[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reddish joined Quins from Super Rugby side Highlanders in November 2016, but made only five appearances.
The 32-year-old New Zealander previously played for Hurricanes and provincial side Wellington.
"Given the medical advice I have received, it's the best decision long term for me and my young family," he told the club website.
"I thoroughly enjoyed living in England and I am sad to cut my time short.  I wish the boys all the best for the upcoming season and beyond."
Saracens lock Alistair Hargreaves was forced to retire last October after suffering a series of concussions.
