The four British football associations have held informal discussions about Team GB sides at future Olympics.

Football Association of Wales chief Jonathan Ford confirmed the meeting took place at the extraordinary Uefa congress in Athens on Wednesday.
But Ford added there had been no shift in Wales' policy opposing GB football teams.
Team GB fielded men and women football teams at London 2012 but not at this year's Games in Rio.

''It would be completely wrong of anybody to say we will not discuss it. That is the wrong attitude," Ford said.
''As an association we are very much more open and transparent than that.
"We have no issue in discussing our point of view and putting our point across.  We are always open to discussion.''
It is expected more formal meetings will take place in future after England's Football Association put forward the idea of sending teams to future Olympics.
Fifa - the sport's governing body - said it would need the agreement of the ruling bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Those three home nations fear such a move could affect their independent status within Fifa and at international tournaments such as the World Cup.
