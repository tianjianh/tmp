The U's lie bottom of League Two after a winless start to their campaign.
"It's as clear as day, we've got a football club that's expecting more and I fully accept that," the 38-year-old told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
"I understand that, for support to be heard, fans want to be looking at a performance level that's high, that's the pressure that we've got."
Cambridge face Morecambe, who sit seventh in the league, on Saturday.
"It's the first time we've really got our strongest squad available to us," Derry added.
"We are hopeful we can do this all together and change the fortune of our football club because no one likes to see us at the bottom of the league."
