[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A slice of the Queen and Prince Philip's fruit wedding cake has been sold for £500 at auction nearly 68 years after the couple were married.

The cake, still wrapped in its original baking parchment, has been kept in its original box by an unnamed woman from Hove, in East Sussex.
Her father had been a guest at the royal wedding on 20 November 1947.
It was auctioned at Gorringes in Lewes and bought by an unnamed bidder from Los Angeles.
The slice, which is still edible due to its high alcohol content, is in an ivory-coloured box decorated with a silver E and P, and the words "Buckingham Palace 20th November 1947".
There is also a small card inscribed "With the best wishes of their Royal Highnesses Princess Elizabeth and Duke of Edinburgh".
The royal couple's four-tiered, 9ft (2.7m) cake was nicknamed "the 10,000-mile wedding cake" after its ingredients were flown to the UK from South Africa and Australia.
