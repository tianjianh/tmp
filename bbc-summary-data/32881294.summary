Out of date sat-navs have been blamed for motorists' slow uptake of a new Â£35m road in Northamptonshire.

The A43 Corby relief road has been open for 12 months and has seen daily traffic levels rise from 8,000 to 11,300 since it opened last May.
But many lorries and cars are still taking the old road through Geddington.
Michael Clarke, from the county council highways department, said: "Old habits die hard and some sat-navs have still not been updated for the new route".
He is pleased more vehicles are now choosing to use the new road, which was expected to carry 25,000 vehicles a day.
Poor signage has also been blamed for the lack of cars.
"It's developing just like the M1 when it opened. It had little traffic at first but is now well used," Mr Clarke said.
"When the penny drops and drivers use the road they realise how quick it is."
He said the road formed part of plans for new roads which bypass the villages of Flore and Weedon near Daventry.
Mark Rowley, chair of Geddington Parish Council, said the road is making some difference to congestion in the village.
He wants the county council to do more to persuade local transport companies to use the new relief road.
Andrew Howard, managing director of a logistics firm at King's Cliffe, said his drivers were encouraged to use the road from the day it opened.
"It is faster and less stressful for our drivers. We made them aware of its advantages straight away," he said.
"It's a faster route to customers in the north of England."
