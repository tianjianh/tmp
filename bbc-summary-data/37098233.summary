You've been hungry for more information during the Olympic Games, with search engine giant Google revealing some of the most-searched-for questions during the Games.
Many of you want to know how the scoring works in judo. And how you train for a marathon.
Or something as 'simple' as wanting to know how to compete in the Olympics.
Whatever it is which has got you reaching for your phone/tablet/computer, BBC Get Inspired can help with the answersâ€¦
1)  It seems plenty of you have been checking out the action on the judo mats and wanting to understand it better. So 'matte!' what you've been doing and take a look at our guide to getting into martial arts for starters.
The official Rio Olympics website also has useful explanations about the scoring - head here and scroll down to 'About' and 'scoring'.
And why not take a look at Andrew Burt's inspirational life in judo for good measure?
2)  The likes of Mark Cavendish, Laura Trott and Joanna Rowsell have been understandably hot search topics in the past 24 hours and it seems some of you want to have a go - so here's how.
Sir Bradley Wiggins is in there expressing his love for the sport - as well as 73-year-old Clive, who still rides on the track.
You never know... this time in four years, you could be competing in Tokyo!

3)  How to qualify for the Olympics is quite a big question!

Hard work and dedication would be certain requirements and there'll be a myriad of different qualification criteria for the different sport, which the International Olympic Committee helps decide.
We think you'll have to start somewhere though, so why not have a look through our A-Z list of all the sport we have guides to - including all the Olympics sports and more - and see if there's something in there you fancy giving a go.
If that seems a bit out of reach you can always try Make Your Move instead - a campaign promoting accessible, physical challenges for everyone.
