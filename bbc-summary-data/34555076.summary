The Met Police and British Transport Police said they worked together to monitor the protest at St Pancras International Station between 17:00 and 20:30 BST.
The demonstrators held placards reading "borders kill" and "no-one is illegal".
One person was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a police officer.
MEP and leader of UKIP Scotland, David Coburn, was at the station having travelled on the Eurostar.
He said the protest had "frightened passengers, including children".
It was organised by three groups - The London Latinxs, a Latin-American anti-oppression activist group, Black Dissidents and Sisters Uncut, which campaigns for domestic violence services.
