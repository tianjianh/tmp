The 69-year-old will work alongside head coach Darren Wassall until the end of the season, when a review of the club's coaching structure will occur.
In addition to his Rams role, Redknapp has agreed to help Jordan for their next two World Cup qualifiers.
Derby sacked previous head coach Paul Clement in February and appointed Wassall until the end of the season.
Redknapp, who has been out of work since leaving QPR in January 2015, told the Derby website: "From the first conversation I had with the chairman (Mel Morris) it was clear he has exciting plans for the football club.
"I am delighted to be able to help out and am looking forward to working with Darren and his team."
The Rams are fifth in the Championship, seven points adrift of an automatic promotion place.
