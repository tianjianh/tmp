[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Defender Barry, who had a spell with Sheffield United, got on the end of Barry McNamee's cross to nod past Peter Cherrie in the seventh minute.
Striker Rory Patterson, back for a second spell with City, shot in for 2-0 on 72 minutes.
The much-travelled Patterson rounded Cherrie for the third in stoppage-time.
The win leaves Kenny Shiels' Derry on six points from three matches.
Former Kilmarnock boss Shiels will be delighted with that tally having started his Brandywell reign with a 1-0 defeat by derby rivals Finn Harps.
The opening goal came after former Plymouth Argyle front man Patterson had seen his volley palmed out by keeper Cherrie.
McNamee curled the ball back into the danger area and 23-year-old Barry got his head on it at the near post.
Patterson, who had a goal ruled out for offside early in the match, made it 2-0 after being set up by midfielder Harry Monaghan, one of Shiels' first signings at the Brandywell.
In stoppage-time Patterson got the better of defender Paul Finnegan to slot in the third for the Candystripes.
