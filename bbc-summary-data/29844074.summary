Malachy Goodman charged with the murder of Edward Gibson

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court charged with the murder of Edward Gibson in west Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Malachy Goodman, 57, of Rockmore Road, Belfast, was remanded in custody until 28 November.
Mr Gibson, 28, was shot in his stomach and thigh in an alley near Divis Tower on 24 October. He died in hospital.
Mr Goodman was also charged with  possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life, and having cannabis with intent to supply.
Police told Belfast Magistrates' Court they are still searching for both the gun used in the killing and a second suspect.
A judge was told police were strongly opposed to Mr Goodman being released on bail. A detective sergeant claimed witnesses in the case could be put at risk.
"The suspect knows many of those who have made statements," he said.
"The firearm used remains outstanding and a second suspect remains at large."
It was also revealed that the home of another person said to have been involved in the incident has been attacked.
"Tensions remain extremely high in the community in relation to his murder," the detective added.
During cross-examination by a defence solicitor, he accepted that Mr Goodman was not picked out at an identification process.
The solicitor also claimed a description given of the alleged killer failed to match his client and said that three different versions of events were provided to police.
