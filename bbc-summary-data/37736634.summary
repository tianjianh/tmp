[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rochdale 1-0 Oldham Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Lund's first-half goal handed Rochdale victory against neighbours Oldham at the Crown Oil Arena.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder's 40th-minute strike saw Dale move up to eighth in League One, leaving the Latics third from bottom.
The first half was dominated by the hosts and Joe Bunney saw a free-kick pushed onto the crossbar by Oldham goalkeeper Connor Ripley, while Lund's goal-bound effort was blocked by Cameron Burgess.
Lund was not to be denied five minutes before the break when Calvin Andrew picked him out and the unmarked midfielder swept home a neat finish from 10 yards.
Before half-time, the visitors finally showed some ambition with Freddie Ladapo racing into the box and holding off the challenge of Niall Canavan to fire goalward, Josh Lillis diverting his effort into the side netting and then saving Burgess' header from the resulting corner.
Oldham were better after the break and came close to netting an equaliser when substitute Billy McKay headed over the top while Lee Erwin saw a couple of efforts fly narrowly wide.
Callum Camps could have claimed a second for Dale but his cushioned volley from 25 yards out was pushed over the bar by Ripley.
