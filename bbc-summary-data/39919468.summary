Some Baggies supporters ignored a warning not to sell tickets in the home section to opposing fans.
Crowd trouble occurred after Michy Batshuayi's late winner.
West Brom chief executive Martin Goodman said any supporters "who could be traced selling on tickets to visiting supporters faced sanctions".
He added: "Naturally it is a matter of great disappointment for all at Albion and our thousands of genuine fans that a tiny minority would put profit before backing their team.
"We will also co-operate fully with police to help identify anyone clearly guilty of disorder offences during the disturbance."
West Midlands Police said seven of those arrested were charged with pitch invasion. They are due to appear before Dudley Magistrates' Court later this month.
A 35-year-old man from Solihull was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and a man from Suffolk, 32, was detained over suspected criminal damage and assault. Both have been bailed.
