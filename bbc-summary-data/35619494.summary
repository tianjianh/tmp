Brandon Goodship got the only goal as he latched onto a flick on from Scott Laird early in the second half.
Laird also forced a good save from Liam O'Brien as John Still's Daggers failed to properly test Artur Krysiak.
The result puts Yeovil three points clear of the drop zone, while Dagenham are eight points from safety.
Dagenham & Redbridge boss John Still told BBC Radio London:

"They had the edge, I don't think we had enough imagination attacking-wise.
"We never created enough goalscoring opportunities. We never found the opportunity to test the goalkeeper.
"We have to find goals. We have people that can score, but we have to give them opportunities. There was no real supply."
