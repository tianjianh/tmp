Worcestershire have awarded a benefit for the 2016 season to their long-serving captain Daryl Mitchell.

The 31-year-old opening batsman, who made his debut 11 years ago, has led the side since replacing Vikram Solanki as skipper in 2010.
"No-one deserves a benefit more than Mitch," said Worcestershire director of cricket Steve Rhodes.
"He has become an integral part of this club, not only as a player but also as a captain in charge of a young side."
Badsey-born Mitchell, one of the few home-grown players born within the county boundary, has now plundered 12,965 runs for Worcestershire in all competitions.
Following Worcestershire's relegation back to Division Two in the County Championship, he will start next season in the second year of his current four-year contract.
