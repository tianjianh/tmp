The 26-year-old spent three months on loan with the U's last term, helping Richard Money's side win promotion.
He scored nine goals in 13 outings, including one in the club's FA Trophy final victory over Gosport Borough.
"He has shown an unbelievable desire to join the club," said director of football Jez George.
