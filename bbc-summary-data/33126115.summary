[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police Scotland confirmed they have been carrying out inquiries into the claims at Merchiston Castle School in Edinburgh.
The allegations at the all-boys school date back to the 1960s.
Det Insp Morag Bruce said two men aged 62 and 69 will appear in court at a later date.
Merchiston Castle, in the Colinton area of the city, follows the English school curriculum and charges up to Â£28,500 per year for boarding pupils.
It has been described by the UK Boarding Schools website as being one of the UK's leading independent schools due to its "balanced curriculum, excellent pastoral care and a high A level pass rate".
Andrew Hunter, headmaster of Merchiston Castle School, told the Sunday Herald newspaper: "We have been offering every possible assistance to Police Scotland as it investigates these historical allegations.
"The appropriate school records have been made available to the investigating officers and we are committed to co-operating fully in support of their inquiries.
"The welfare and safety of our pupils is the central, over-riding priority at Merchiston and our safeguarding and child protection policies are robust, comprehensive and fully compliant with current Scottish legislation."
