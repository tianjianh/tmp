Janet Hayward of Cadoxton Primary School, Barry, is in the running to win the second annual Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize.
The accolade is widely referred to as the Nobel Prize for teaching and is the largest prize of its kind.
Ms Hayward is one of three UK teachers to have been shortlisted.
In her nomination, she was described as being known "for her enthusiasm in inspiring pupils to learn in new ways".
One of her schools was among the early users of wi-fi in the classroom, winning a national technology award, while her current school is a test case for solar powered computers and has eight screens in every classroom.
Ms Hayward said if she won, she would put the prize towards a community cafe.
"It's not for me personally. The big hope is that the prize would come to the school and fund a community cafe that we're looking to build for the Cadoxton community," she told BBC Radio Wales.
Since 2012, Ms Hayward has chaired the National Digital Learning Council and in 2014 she received an OBE for services to education.
Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey Foundation, said the thousands of nominations and applications received was "testimony to the achievements of teachers".
