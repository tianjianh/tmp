The FTSE 100 closed down 66 points, or 0.93%, to 6,994.63.
The biggest faller was the wealth management firm St James's Place, which fell by 3%.
On the currency markets, the pound edged up 0.05% against the dollar to $1.4941 and slipped 0.15% against the euro to â‚¬1.3857.
The pound rose sharply after the latest jobs figures showed unemployment continuing to fall. The rate fell to 5.6%, the lowest since July 2008. However the British currency later fell back.
Trading was also complicated earlier in the session by the failure of Bloomberg's trading terminals, used by many firms in the City, which went down for two and a half hours.
The problems caused a UK debt auction to be cancelled.
