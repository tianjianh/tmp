Aristote Nsiala: Shrewsbury Town successful in appeal at defender's red card

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Shrewsbury Town have won their appeal over the red card handed out to new signing Aristote Nsiala on his debut.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Just six days after joining the League One club from Hartlepool, the 24-year-old defender was dismissed for his challenge on Luke Norris in Saturday's 1-1 draw at Swindon.
But, after initially receiving a four-match Football Association ban, that has now been overturned.
Nsiala is instead free to make his home debut against Bradford City.
Saturday's match sees the Town start outside the League One bottom four for the first time in four months.
Nsiala's sending-off is the second of Shrewsbury's eight red cards this season to be overturned.
"I'm pleased for myself and the club and I'm particularly pleased for Toto," said Town boss Paul Hurst. "He was delighted when the message was passed on. It would have been a long time training with no game to look forward to when you've just arrived at a club.
"It's not easy being a referee, but I genuinely thought he got the ball at the time. When we looked at it, the footage was clear and I'm really pleased that the panel came to the same conclusion."
