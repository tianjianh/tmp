Sale Sharks scrum-half Peter Stringer has targeted playing at the top level past the age of 40.

The former Ireland number nine turns 39 on 13 December and if he did earn a new deal with Sale, he would be playing Premiership rugby at 40 next season.
Stringer, who won 98 caps for his country, joined the Sharks last season after spells at Munster, Saracens, Newcastle and Bath.
"It is a landmark, but it is only next year," Stringer told Rugby Union Extra.
"I genuinely feel as I did 10 years ago. I still enjoy the training and playing so as long as the body and mind are in sync I shall keep going as long as I can."
Stringer puts his longevity down to never drinking alcohol, his lifestyle and enjoying keeping fit.
"It's diet, it's sleep, it's everything," he added. "It's is probably since moving to the UK and getting that shock at Munster of not being involved in the matchday squad and I suppose people writing you off.
"Coming over here and getting a new lease of life and realising that whatever number of years I do have left in the game, I want to give myself every opportunity to be at the top."
Stringer also spoke to BBC Radio Manchester for the first time since the sudden death of his Munster captain and friend Anthony Foley last month.
Five days after he passed, Stringer started in Sale's 15-5 loss to the Champions Cup loss to Toulon on a personally emotional night at AJ Bell Stadium.
"Anthony is a guy who would not have wanted me to sit at home and keep my head down - it was a matter of getting on the field," he said
"I'm glad I played against Toulon and it then it hit me when the final whistle went and I was sat in the changing room.
"On the field this guy was just a sensational player, one of the brightest I've ever come across on a rugby field."
