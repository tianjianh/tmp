The five-time Grand Slam winner, 28, revealed on Monday that she tested positive for meldonium in January.
"I woke up yesterday morning with an inbox full of love and compassion," wrote the Russian. "Your wonderful words put a smile on my face."
Sharapova, who faces a ban of up to four years, said she was "determined to play tennis again".
"I wish I didn't have to go through this, but I do - and I will," she wrote.
"I have not been online much except the odd search for a new antique coffee table, but my friends made a collage for me with all your beautiful messages and hashtags that you created.
"I spent the afternoon reading them next to my dog, who couldn't quite understand why this was more important than the walk he was expecting to take."
Meldonium was developed to treat diabetes and heart-related diseases but could have a positive effect on stamina and endurance because it can increase the flow of oxygen to muscles.
It was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) list of banned substances on 1 January 2016.
Sharapova, who says she has been taking meldonium for 10 years for health reasons, has had some sponsorship deals ended or postponed.
The International Tennis Federation said she will be provisionally suspended from 12 March.
