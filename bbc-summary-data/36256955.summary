The 36-year-old from Eastbourne uploaded two sexually explicit pictures of his ex-partner that were taken when they were in a relationship.
He also posted non-sexual images of three women with offensive captions.
Sussex Police said the case would be reviewed in light of "concern". Police and crime commissioner Katy Bourne has asked the force to clarify its policy.
The man was arrested and cautioned in April after the victims contacted officers.
The force has been criticised for issuing a caution by the mother of one of the victims, Eastbourne MP Caroline Ansell and Polly Neate, the boss of charity Woman's Aid.
Sussex Police said the man, who has not been named, "made full admissions and expressed remorse" and its original decision "fits the national framework for out-of-court disposals".
But Det Supt Nick May told BBC Sussex the force was going to look into the case "in view of the concern that has been raised and the interest that this has caused".
"One of those aspects that particularly concerned me was around the potential for threats being made to one of the young women and I want to make sure, absolutely, that those are looked into appropriately," he added.
Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Ms Bourne said: "What worries me is that whilst I heard Sussex Police's response I actually don't feel very reassured at this point in time.
"Sussex Police claim that they put victims first and  I would disagree that they have in this instance."
Revenge porn became an offence in April 2015 and refers to the act of a partner or ex-partner purposefully distributing images or videos of a sexual nature without the other person's consent.
