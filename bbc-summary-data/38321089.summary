An official at the Brazilian club told AFP the team are scheduled to play International de Lage at home in a state championship game.
The team's plane ran out of fuel and crashed near Medellin, Colombia on 28 November, killing 71 people, including most of the players and management.
Three players were among the six survivors, while nine did not travel.
Chapecoense were travelling to Medellin to play the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final against Atletico Nacional, the biggest game in the club's history.
They have since been awarded the title by South American football confederation Conmebol.
Two of the players who survived, defender Alan Ruschel and goalkeeper Jakson Follmann, who has had his leg amputated, returned to Brazil on Tuesday. The third, Neto, remains in hospital in Colombia.
Vagner Mancini has been appointed manager to rebuild the team, based in Chapeco, in southern Brazil.
Brazil's leading football clubs have pledged to loan players to Chapecoense for free and asked for them to be safeguarded from relegation from the top flight for the next three seasons.
Former Brazil and Barcelona forward Ronaldinho and ex-Argentina international Juan Roman Riquelme have reportedly offered to play for the club, while another former Barca player, Eidur Gudjohnsen, has offered his services.
The team's last match was the day before the crash and their final game of this season was cancelled by the Brazilian federation.
