The National Crime Agency said 29lbs (13kg) of drugs were found inside an unclaimed package on a luggage carousel at Leeds Bradford Airport in March.
Kulwinder El-Assad, of Beaumont Close, Tipton, West Midlands, was convicted of smuggling at Leeds Crown Court.
Mohammed Khan, 61, of no fixed address and Arbab Akhtar, 29, of Romney Walk, Blackburn, both admitted smuggling.
El-Assad, 40, was jailed for 12 years, Akhtar was handed an eight-year sentence, with Khan jailed for six.
Border Force officers opened the package, sent from Islamabad in Pakistan.
Khan and El-Assad were arrested the following day at the airport when they arrived to pick up the parcel.
During police interviews Khan, who arrived on the same flight as the parcel, said he had travelled to Pakistan to visit a dying relative. Officers said his ticket had been paid for by Akhtar.
Using phone evidence, police found Akhtar had driven to Ashton-Under-Lyne to collect Khan, taken him to Blackburn to get his ticket and then dropped him off at the airport.
Mick Maloney, from the National Crime Agency, said: "All three played key roles.
"El-Assad was in touch with those they sourced the drugs from in Pakistan.
"Akhtar was the logistics man who made all the travel arrangements and was in regular contact with the others, while Khan was the courier."
