Warburton, 28, has not played since injuring a knee on 7 April.
The Wales flanker, who has been training with the Lions, could return next week if the Blues beat Stade.
"I think he's progressing very well and hopefully he'll be back fit soon," said Cardiff Blues head coach Danny Wilson.
"It's hard to see past Friday night. We have a rough idea of where things might be but, once you know the result from Friday night, you know how the planning will go.
"From Sam's point of view, you go day by day. Will he be fit next week? There's definitely a chance he will be but how big that chance is I couldn't tell you."

If Blues beat Stade they will meet the winner of Northampton v Connacht for the chance to play in Europe's top-tier club competition in 2017-18.
Almost two-thirds of the 41-man Lions squad are currently with their clubs, regions and provinces ahead of Aviva Premiership, Guinness Pro12 and Champions Cup play-offs next weekend.
Warburton is expected to be fit for the Lions' first game of their summer tour of New Zealand, against New Zealand Provincial Barbarians on 3 June.
Should the Blues win in Paris, the 2013 Lions captain will be assessed further with a view to potentially playing against Northampton or Connacht.
"The assessment for next week, if we win this weekend, we'll see if he's available in terms of fitness for the second game should we make it," Wilson added.
"He's not fit for this game and how next week pans out we'll wait and see. There's a result that needs to happen first and then decisions around his fitness."
