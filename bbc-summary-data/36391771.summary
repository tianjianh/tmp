The Channel 5 newsreader told Woman and Home magazine that she was diagnosed a week after her 50th birthday in 2014.
The 51-year-old said she had always thought she was healthy as she "did all the right things - I was a green tea drinker, a salmon eater, a runner".
She said her main fear was not seeing her two youngest children grow up.
"My biggest fear was not being there as a mum - and for some unfathomable reason, I couldn't stop thinking that I want to be here for my daughter Evie to watch her get married," the mother-of-four said.
"My aunt died of breast cancer, and I'd lost my mum to liver and bowel cancer - and I gradually began to realise how bewildered and scared I was."
She also told the magazine that nobody apart from her children's teacher knew she had undergone a double mastectomy.
It has not been revealed when she underwent the operation but Williams said she was "horrible" to her husband Paul Woolwich at the time because she was intent on "being strong".
"Paul is an extraordinary man," she said.
"I have learnt I need to let him know if I need support or an outstretched hand to help me up."

Williams presented BBC Breakfast from 2001 to 2012, having first joined the BBC as a trainee and reported on the Hillsborough disaster for BBC Radio Merseyside.
She continues to make occasional programmes for BBC radio and television.
Her revelation comes as BBC journalist Victoria Derbyshire completes her last major treatment for breast cancer.
