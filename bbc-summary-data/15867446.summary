Mr Puri made the comments at Delhi's Ramlila ground when activist Anna Hazare was on a 12-day hunger strike.
Mr Puri described MPs as "illiterate, rustic and useless".
MPs have protection from insults and parliament sent Mr Puri a notice asking him to explain his comments.
A spokesman for Mr Puri confirmed to the BBC that the actor wrote a letter to the speaker about a month ago, but refused to divulge the details.
"We have tendered an unconditional apology," he said.
The Hindustan Times newspaper reports that the Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar is expected to close the case and pardon the actor.
Parliament has the power to summon individuals for a reprimand if they refuse to apologise.
A string of corruption scandals has angered many Indians and Mr Hazare's campaign had received widespread support and a great deal of media coverage.
Mr Puri had taken the stage and addressed the crowd during Mr Hazare's fast.
"Look at the way they [MPs] fight with each other. They throw chairs, mikes at each others," he had said.
After his comments were criticised by several MPs, Mr Puri apologised.
"I am unhappy with myself over two of the terms that I used. The first is 'uneducated' and the second is 'useless'. I agree I could have used better language, but I was caught in the moment and so used those terms," he told the IBN7 news channel.
Om Puri has acted in both mainstream and art films in Bollywood.
He has also appeared in several British films, like Jewel in the Crown, Gandhi and City of Joy, and BBC TV's Canterbury Tales.
He was awarded an honorary OBE for his contribution to the British film industry in 2004.
