MHKs David Anderson and Tim Crookall are nominated along with Phil Braidwood MLC, Thomas Moyle and Adrian Tinkler.
The council is the upper chamber of the Manx Parliament and consists of eleven members including the President of Tynwald, the Bishop of Sodor and Man, and the Attorney General.
The election will be held at the House of Keys on Monday 22 June.
Mr Anderson, Mr Crookall and Mr Braidwood all failed to gain the backing of at least 13 MHKs in last month's election.
Glenfaba MHK David Anderson came the closest to being elected, securing 11 votes.
Tynwald is said to be the oldest continuous parliament in the world dating back more than 1,000 years.
