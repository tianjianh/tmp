Departing Portsmouth defender Enda Stevens has backed his former team-mates to have a successful campaign in League One next season.

Stevens, 26, completed a move to Championship-bound Sheffield United on Monday after two seasons at Pompey.
"The manager (Paul Cook) has a lot of experience of taking clubs up from League Two to League One," the left-back told BBC Radio Solent.
"He always lets the players make mistakes and express themselves."
Stevens has signed a three-year contract with Sheffield United and the former Aston Villa defender will join the Blades after his two-year deal at Fratton Park expired.
Having missed just one game all season, he helped Portsmouth to the League Two title on the final day of the season.
"Ending on a high was obviously the best way I could have left the club," he said.
"It was a difficult decision to leave as I enjoyed myself so much, I enjoyed living in the area and the club is a massive and great one to play for.
"But, I felt the opportunity to play in the Championship was one I couldn't pass up. It's exciting to go to a club that got 100 points in League One this season.
"It's going to be tough to get in the side, but it's up to me to work hard to make it happen."
