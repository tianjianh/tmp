Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has praised residents of an Oxfordshire village for their support during filming as the programme comes to an end.

The final episode of the ITV period drama won the Christmas Day TV ratings battle with 6.6 million viewers.
A number of scenes were shot in Bampton - which has a population of about 2,500.
Lord Fellowes said residents had been "really charming" throughout filming.
"Normally, you know, when filming comes the first day everyone's terribly excited - 'wee isn't this thrilling' - and then by about the third month people get fed up with it," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
"But they have remained supportive and hospitable right through the whole filming period.
"We are so grateful to them."
Christmas Day was the last opportunity for viewers to follow the fortunes of the aristocratic Crawley family, as Lady Edith finally got her happy ending, Lady Mary found out she was pregnant and Anna and Mr Bates welcomed their first child.
However, Lord Fellowes also said he would like to see the show on the big screen.
"It's possible and I hope it happens, I mean I'm up for it because we'd be able to do things in a film we've never been able to do on television and we can have a much larger canvas", he said.
However, he added: "But it's not my decision. It's up to the studio."
Other film locations for Downton Abbey include Highclere Castle in Hampshire, which is the fictitious family's stately home.
