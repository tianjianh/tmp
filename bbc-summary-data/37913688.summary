[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Seavan Fried Chicken and Pizza House, in Fratton Road, Portsmouth, was also prosecuted after rat droppings were found in the cellar store and frozen meat was poorly stored.
Company director Binai Ali pleaded guilty at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court to a total of 10 offences.
The city council said the business was "an imminent risk to public health".
Out-of-date equipment and rubbish were also stored in the cellar - which hampered cleaning - and the cellar steps were found to be greasy and broken.
The company was fined a total of £10,000 and a £100 victim surcharge, while 34-year-old Ali was fined £1,500 and ordered to pay costs of £1,176, and a victim surcharge of £20.
A spokeswoman for Portsmouth City Council, which brought the prosecution, said: "The condition of the business presented an imminent risk to public health and voluntary closure was necessary until the hygiene standards were improved.
"The court commented that these were serious offences and that there was a danger to public health."
