Fast bowler Cross returned figures of 8-47 as Heywood bowled Unsworth out for 121 in their Central Lancashire League fixture and won by six wickets.
In April, 23-year-old Cross became the first woman to play in the league in its 123-year-history.
Cross, who also plays for Lancashire women, took 3-19 on her debut to help Heywood beat Clifton in April.
Former England spinner and current Lancashire head coach Ashley Giles tweeted his congratulations to Cross.
And Lancashire tweeted: "Congratulations to @LancsCCC and @ECB_cricket bowler @katecross16 (8-47) who's taken 8 wickets for @HeywoodCC."
She made her first of two England Test appearances in January 2014 against Australia, and has nine one-day international caps.
Following her first-team debut last month, Heywood chairman John Rhodes said: "Kate playing for the first XI represented a very proud moment for the club.
"At a time when there is strong focus from the Lancashire Cricket Board and ECB on the development and growth of women's cricket I am delighted that we continue to play a part in this exciting time for the women's and girls' game."
