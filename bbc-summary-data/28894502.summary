The Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh Airport last August.
Sarah Darnley, of Elgin, Gary McCrossan, of Inverness, Duncan Munro, of Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, of Winchester, died.
A dedication service was held at the Sumburgh Airport memorial site on Saturday and wreaths put in the sea.
A helicopter flypast also took place.
The service was led by Fishermen's Mission Superintendent Aubrey Jamieson.
He said it was right to pause and honour those who had lost their lives.
A new plaque was dedicated to the victims and a number of survivors made the journey to the islands for the service.
Two wreaths were laid at the site of the crash by RNLI crew.
Survivors of the crash paid tribute to their rescuers following the service.
A short statement issued on their behalf said: "We are all here to pay our respects to those who lost their lives that night. We are grateful to have the chance to meet and thank the brave crew members who helped us.
"The whole Shetland community rallied around us in a time of need and we would like to express our deep gratitude to so many people - coastguard, RNLI, hospital staff, police, workers at Sumburgh Airport, Red Cross - for everything."
When the Super Puma crashed last year 18 people were on board the helicopter at the time.
The accident was the fourth of its kind in five years.
The Shetland memorial is dedicated to those who lost their lives in aircraft accidents in the area over the past three decades.
