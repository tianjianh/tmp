Ceilidhs, rock gigs, a jewellery-making workshop and even speed-dating are among the events lined up for Museums at Night.
Festival manager Nick Stockman said they wanted to capitalise on the "special feeling" people get from going to a museum after hours.
Rose Clark, from organisers Culture 24, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland that the festival opens cultural hubs to a new audience.
She said: "We have an amazing culture and heritage offering here in the UK but it can be quite difficult if you're working nine-to-five to actually get out with friends and family and explore museums and galleries.
"The Museums and Night festival is all about offering really exciting after-hours programmes to all new audiences to explore amazing museums and galleries on their doorsteps."
Here is a selection of some of the events taking place in Scotland.
Rock band Idlewild will headline a full evening of entertainment at the landmark Edinburgh museum on Friday.
Guests will have the rare opportunity to explore the building at a time when it is normally closed and to take part in a hands-on archaeology workshop.
A performance by The Beltane Fire Society, a silent disco and pop-up bars are also part of the packed programme of events.
This museum will host a jewellery making workshop with a mathematical twist on Friday.
Participants will learn how maths can be used to make things beautiful - and then put the theory into practice.

Evening tours of this 18th-century castle in Maybole will be available on Saturday as part of an evening's entertainment in honour of the Museums at Night festival.
Afterwards visitors will be invited to take part in a traditional Ayrshire ceilidh in the Home Farm.

There will be a spooky feel to Museums at Night at The Tenement House museum in Garnethill, Glasgow, on Thursday.
From 19:00, visitors will receive a tour of the property before they enter the parlour to meet a professional mind reader, astrologer and psychic.
He will demonstrate techniques used by the mind readers and fortune tellers of the late Victorian period and early 20th century, including tricks, palmistry and crystal gazing.
Purely entertainment, organisers claim it will give an insight into a mysterious element of local history.
Science fiction and science fact will collide at Super Sci-Fi Saturday in Paisley this weekend.
Organisers have promised an interactive theatre performance, arts and craft activities as well as film and story-telling sessions - with a superhero spin.
Afterwards visitors will be invited to take part in a stargazing session at Coats Observatory, where the science of the solar system will be explained in a planetarium film show.
There will be a speed dating event with a difference in St Andrews on Saturday, when the British Golf Museum plays host to the match-making occasion.
Its organisers say it doesn't matter whether participants are avid golfers or they're unable to "tell their tea from their tees".
They will be introduced to the museum by a curator, before climbing to the rooftop cafe where they will have four minutes to impress each date.
There will also be an opportunity to explore the galleries after hours.
