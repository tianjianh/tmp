China's Weiyu Zhu hit a 21-over-par 92 in the first round of the Australian Open as Jordan Spieth started the defence of his title with a 71.

The 26-year-old, a professional since 2011, started on the 10th with a triple-bogey seven and closed with a quadruple-bogey eight on the ninth.
He managed to birdie the seventh hole, but is 26 shots adrift of round one leader Lincoln Tighe of Australia.
Tighe, the world number 1022, upstaged the field with a five-under 66.
In windy conditions, Spieth's 71, was three shots better than the round average as only 18 players finished below par.
"It was difficult because we played a lot of holes in side-winds, so it was just a guessing game really," he said.
"It's been a while since I've played in wind like this and with the toughest part in deciding what shot to hit. You can use the same club and end up with a 30-yard difference based on if you hold the ball up or ride the wind."
Spieth is tied 19th alongside Australia's former Masters champion Adam Scott who had two double bogeys in his level-par round, while England's Lee Westwood is 11th on one under.
