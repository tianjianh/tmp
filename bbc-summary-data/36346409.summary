Guest blog: Risk-free reshuffle?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Did Carwyn Jones play it safe by not introducing new Labour backbenchers to the government? Or take a risk in welcoming a minister from a rival party? Here's a guest blog by our political correspondent Daniel Davies.

Carwyn Jones has been spared the hassle of having to sack anyone in this reshuffle.
Two former ministers stood down and another lost his seat at the election.
So why did Mr Jones decide not use that opportunity to bring in fresh talent from the Labour benches?
With one obvious exception - Kirsty Williams - there are no new faces in the government.
In private, Carwyn Jones has told people that the current crop of Labour AMs is the best since devolution started, but he didn't want to make ministers of any newly-elected AMs.
There are promotions for Ken Skates and Vaughan Gething. And Alun Davies is back in the government, two years after Mr Jones sacked him (more on that later).
But apart from the returning Mr Davies, everyone else was already in the government before the election.
All of which makes Mrs Williams's appointment even more striking.
It's a bold move. Perhaps Mr Jones feels emboldened after leading a successful election campaign. The result, dropping just one sat, was better than even his inner circle expected.
Mrs Williams's arrival in Cathays Park risks annoying Labour backbenchers who feel overlooked. But it is evidently a risk Mr Jones was willing to taking, even though it does not give him a majority of seats in the Senedd chamber.
Now the reshuffle is over, he has another vacancy to fill. His adviser Jo Kiernan is moving on having worked for him and his predecessor Rhodri Morgan for 10 years.
And back to Alun Davies.
Watch the clip below to hear what the first minister told Vaughan Roderick when he sacked Mr Davies in 2014 after he asked civil servants for information about the farm subsidy payments of five opposition AMs. One of those AMs was Kirsty Williams.
