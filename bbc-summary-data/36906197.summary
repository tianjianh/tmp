Jockey Ryan Moore was beaten by Frankie Dettori and Galileo Gold at Royal Ascot last month, with Dettori again taking his three-year-old into an early lead.
Dettori attempted to move clear over a furlong out, but the Aidan O'Brien-trained 11-8 favourite came alongside and eventually won by a neck.
"Ryan gave him a masterful ride but he has a lot of speed," said O'Brien.
Ribchester, ridden by James Doyle, was a close third, while Awtaad - second behind Galileo Gold at Ascot last month - fell out of contention towards the end of the race.
After creditable runs in defeat in the St James' Palace Stakes at Ascot and then again at Sandown, O'Brien was delighted to see The Gurkha home first in Goodwood's Â£1m race.
"I was worried about him as he has had such a big career crammed into a very short time," he added. "He has danced every dance all the way along and he has been turned out plenty."

"It's clear that there are some talented three-year-olds in flat racing's all-important Classic generation in 2016.
"The list is headed by The Gurkha, Galileo Gold and Hawkbill, and the fillies Minding and Alice Springs, which have all graduated from beating their own age group to being able to kick aside older opponents as happened here.
"Now the big question is: are they all brilliant, or is the fact that they have been beating each other by not very far of late indicative of the fact they are an only OK bunch? There are still three months of the season in which to find out, but nothing looks outstanding at this stage."
Earlier, Sir Michael Stoute's 9-2 second favourite Ulysses was a half-length victor in the Gordon Stakes.
The three-year-old, the son of 2001 Derby winner Galileo, bounced back from a disappointing 12th place at last month's Derby to give Stoute his 173rd winner at Goodwood.
"He is still learning how to race," said jockey Andrea Atzeni. "He was still keen today but he loves nice ground and he appreciated that. I'm just delighted to get the ride on him again."
Star Rider, ridden by Jimmy Fortune, ran out the decisive winner from Percy Veer in the Goodwood Stakes Handicap.
However, the British Horseracing Authority has confirmed Nicky Henderson's No Heretic, winner of the Chester Cup, has died after collapsing inside the final furlong.
James Doyle rode three winners, Yalta in the Molecomb Stakes, Sagaciously in the Breeders' Series Fillies' Handicap and Shady Mccoy in the NatWest Stakes.
David Probert won the Maiden Fillies' Stakes on Perfect Angel.
