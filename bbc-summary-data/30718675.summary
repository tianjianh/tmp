[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Painting materials once owned by JMW Turner form part of a new exhibition inspired by Mike Leigh's recent film on the master British landscape artist.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brushes, a folding travelling palette and a pocket paint-book caked with watercolour will be on show at Petworth House in West Sussex from Saturday.
Oil and watercolour paintings, along with personal possessions including a ring and gold watch, can also be seen.
Four costumes from the film, Mr Turner, also form part of the exhibition.
Turner painted many works at the 17th Century mansion house between 1809 and 1837 when he visited as a guest of the 3rd Earl of Egremont.
A fishing rod he used at the house's lake and a selection of his books will also be on display.
There will also be rarely-seen portraits of the artist, including possibly the last image painted before his death.
Actor Timothy Spall played the painter in director Leigh's film, released in October.
Paintings he created while training for his role will be on show in a mock-up of Turner's studio created from props used in the film, plus behind-the-scenes footage.
Leigh said: "Petworth wrote itself into the film rather than us having to think of possible stately homes. It is such an extraordinary and rare and rarefied place."
Andrew Loukes, curator of collections and exhibitions at Petworth House, added: "Turner is an important part of the story at Petworth House.
"We are thrilled to be able to mount this celebration of his life."
The exhibition runs until 11 March.
