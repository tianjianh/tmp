Phil Dollman: Exeter Chiefs full-back injured ahead of Wales tour

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Full-back Phil Dollman is an injury concern ahead of Wales' summer tour after suffering an injury in Exeter's Premiership final win over Wasps.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uncapped Dollman, 32, scored Exeter's second try but limped off the field early in the second half after suffering a knee injury.
The 32-year-old was called up by Wales in midweek to replace injured Cardiff Blues teenager Rhun Williams.
Wales face Tonga and Samoa in June's two-Test tour.
Dollman discovered his international call-up earlier in the week as he was preparing for the Premiership final at Twickenham.
Wales prop Tomas Francis was a second half replacement for Exeter, who edged past Wasps in extra time and to win their first ever Premiership title.
