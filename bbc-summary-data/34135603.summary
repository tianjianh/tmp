Migrant crisis: Hungary PM to meet European leaders

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hungary's leader is due in Brussels for talks on the migrant crisis, with thousands still stranded at a Budapest railway station.

Since Tuesday, migrants have been prevented from boarding trains there amid disagreement over EU policy.
Many in Budapest have tickets and want to travel north, but Hungary, led by anti-immigrant Prime Minister Viktor Orban, says it is enforcing EU rules.
Germany, Italy and France have demanded a fair distribution of refugees.
At least 2,000 people are now waiting to travel from Keleti station, having been prevented from getting on trains on Tuesday. Some were involved in scuffles with police on Wednesday night.
They had bought tickets after Hungary briefly appeared to abandon efforts on Monday to register migrants, allowing huge numbers to board trains to Vienna and southern Germany.
"We don't want to stay in Hungary, we want to go to whatever place we want," one Syrian man, Mohammed, told the Associated Press agency. "They are forcing us to stay here."
Elsewhere in the Hungarian capital, thousands marched in solidarity with the migrants, and demanded the government do more to help them.
"The government is carrying out policies which are inhumane, un-Christian and lack solidarity," one protester, Veronika Kramer, told AP.
But in southern Hungary, hundreds of members of the neo-fascist group Jobbik confronted people walking into the country along railway lines from Serbia.

Viktor Orban is an often controversial figure known for his plain speaking.
His government in Budapest has been notably critical of the European Commission's role in the migration crisis, seeing it as too soft. Today's talks are unlikely to produce a meeting of minds.
The Commission is drawing up plans due to be unveiled next week that would create a permanent mechanism to distribute migrants across EU countries, under a formula based on wealth and population.
All EU countries would be required to take part in the scheme, except Britain, Ireland and Denmark - but even they are coming under pressure to offer more voluntary assistance.
On Wednesday, Germany, Italy and France called for "fair distribution" of refugees throughout the EU.
But when he meets European leaders in Brussels, Mr Orban is likely to stress his opposition to taking in more migrants.
Italy and Greece have complained that they are overwhelmed by the numbers arriving on their shores. And while countries such as Germany are prepared to accept large numbers of asylum seekers, others are not.
On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister David Cameron said that taking "more and more" refugees was not the answer.
The human cost of the crisis was made clear on Wednesday when five children were among 12 migrants who drowned in Turkish waters while trying to reach Greece. Images of a child's body washed up near the resort of Bodrum circulated widely on social media.

Full coverage of Europe migrant crisis
The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels, with 107,500 arriving in July alone.
Germany expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year - four times last year's total.
EU interior and justice ministers will meet in Brussels on 14 September to address the crisis.
The word migrant is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "one who moves, either temporarily or permanently, from one place, area, or country of residence to another".
A refugee is, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention, any person who "owing to a well-founded fear" of persecution is outside their country of nationality and "unable" or "unwilling" to seek the protection of that country. To gain the status, one has to go through the legal process of claiming asylum.
The word migrant has traditionally been considered a neutral term, but some criticise the BBC and other media for using a word they say implies something voluntary, and should not be applied to people fleeing danger.
