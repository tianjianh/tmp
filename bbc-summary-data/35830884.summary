Allerdale Borough Council approve car parking charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to increase parking charges across Cumbria have been approved by Allerdale Borough Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council's executive committee voted to increase daytime operating hours from 07:00 to 19:00 and bring in a £1 overnight parking charge.
A permit for low income people will remain at £70 for six months after "concerns" raised in the consultation.
The council said it aimed to ensure every car park was well used and remained accessible to all.
Short-stay parking in Wigton has increased to 50p for the first 30 minutes and a new charge of £2.50 is being implemented for six hours.
The costs for the same period of time in long-stay car parks in Cockermouth and Workington is £4, with six hours in Keswick going up to £7.
In Mill Street, Maryport, parking will be free to use with a disc for a maximum of two hours.
Alex Boardman, who runs Alexandra's of Keswick clothes shop, said the difference in parking charges between Keswick and the surrounding towns "was not very fair".
She said: "I do think that they will have a damaging effect on local businesses.
"I'm worried... I still want my customers to be able to feel like they can still come to Keswick and be able to park reasonably."
Allerdale councillor Michael Heaslip, said: "This is not a blanket approach, but we've looked at each particular town and the categorisation of each car park.
"We have looked at the varied responses received and weighed the arguments up, so that where we found them convincing we have modified the proposals to address the concerns raised.
"The overnight charge means that visitors will no longer have to get up early to feed the machines, as they can pay in advance."
The changes will come into effect in April.
