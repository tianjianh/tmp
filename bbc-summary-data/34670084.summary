The biennial women's match-play event between Europe and United States was last held in Scotland in 2000.
This year's tournament, held in Germany last month, was won 14½-13½ by the American team.
Gleneagles hosted Europe's successful defence of the Ryder Cup last year and the course was chosen ahead of Bro Hof Slott in Sweden for the Solheim Cup.
Ladies European Tour chief executive Ivan Khodabakhsh said: "I want to congratulate the Scotland bid team for their work.
"It was an extremely close decision and our heartfelt thanks go to our friends from Sweden for their hugely impressive bid.
"The Bro Hof Slott Golf Club is one of Europe's very finest courses and we look forward to working with them in the future.
"The competitive nature of the bidding process for the 2019 event is testimony to the growth in interest in women's professional golf and women's sport in general.
"The Solheim Cup has grown to be the biggest event in the women's game, delivering outstanding value to its partners at a local, national and international level."
The Gleneagles bid was led by VisitScotland in conjunction with the Scottish government.
And Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon described the announcement of Gleneagles' staging of the event as "tremendous news, not only for golf tourism and events in Scotland but for Scotland as a whole".
"It will help cement Scotland's reputation as the home of golf and the perfect stage for major golf events and help inspire a new generation of children to take up the game invented in their home country," she added.
The 2017 event will take place at Des Moines in Iowa.
