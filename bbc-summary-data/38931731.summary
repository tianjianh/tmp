[SN]TITLE[SN]
Durham Council seeks 'cold-blooded and spineless' employee

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A council has advertised for a "Cold-blooded and Spineless Officer" - do you know anyone who fits the bill?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Durham County Council is seeking someone educated to degree level, with experience of organising workshops.
But the eyebrow raising job title does not refer to the required personality traits, rather it is a role recording invertebrates with a nature project.
The advert was for internal applicants only, but could be viewed externally by anyone using a search engine.
The temporary post, to cover maternity leave, is for a co-ordinator with the Cold-blooded and Spineless Project at the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) Partnership Staff Unit.
The advert for the role, based in Stanhope, Weardale, was shared more than 1,350 times, with many people suggesting others who were "ideally suited" and telling them it was their "lucky day".
The advert also inspired a Reddit thread, with comments including: "I can do the cold blooded. Is 'spineless' an optional requirement?".
Another said: "Maybe the dude who rejected the waitress applicant with a crying emoji could try for it", referring to a restaurant chain's rejection gaffe.
The authority said that it had advertised the post on behalf of the North Pennines AONB Partnership, and so would not be making any further comments.
