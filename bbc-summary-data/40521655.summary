History buffs to probe Lord Haw Haw Derbyshire rumours

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
History campaigners are hoping to get to the bottom of decades-long rumours surrounding the infamous wartime traitor Lord Haw Haw.

William Joyce was the voice behind Nazi propaganda radio programme 'Germany Calling', which amassed UK audiences of nine million during World War Two.
He was hanged as a traitor in 1946.
Renishaw St Matthew's Church Group has won funding to investigate rumours the American-born broadcaster lived in Derbyshire in the interwar years.
Richard Godley, from the group, said rumours he lived in North East Derbyshire and South Yorkshire "have circulated for decades".
"I've heard multiple people talk about him being resident in the area down the years," he said.
"It's going to be interesting to confirm if one of the most notorious figures of the war was here and, if he was, what he was actually doing here.
"The stories have been lost in the mists in time, but we think there is no smoke without fire."
The group has given Â£31,700 in Heritage Lottery funding to work on the project.
It will work with local schools and churches to explore "stories of local family connections to World War One" and raise awareness of wartime history.
