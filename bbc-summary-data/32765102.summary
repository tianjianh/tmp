Protesters gathered on Queen Street at 13:00 BST for the event organised by the Cardiff's People Assembly,
It follows a similar rally two days after the general election, which saw singer Charlotte Church launch an attack on the Conservative party.
Church joined the march for the second week running.
Warning against a "Tory ideology of greed and money", Saturday's protest was also supported on Twitter by Welsh actor Michael Sheen.
Police estimated over 500 people were at the event, whilst organisers put the figure closer to 1,000.
The Conservative Party has been asked to comment on the march.
Organiser Jamie Insole said: "I am thrilled that Michael has chosen to support this event.
"With 74% of new Welsh jobs below the living wage, the weeping sore of the bedroom tax and communities confronting record cuts, we need a grass roots movement to push back."
Fellow organiser Adam Johannes said: "In 1945, Britain was bankrupt, in debt, with a higher deficit than now and yet the government built half-a-million council houses, founded the NHS, launched the welfare state.
"We do not accept a government that less than quarter of people actually voted for can take that away from us."
Parents Bob and Emma Gwinnett-Davies joined the rally after what they called a "devastating general election result".
Speaking to BBC Wales, Mrs Gwinnet-Davies said she was concerned about her son's future concerning the NHS and free healthcare.
She added they were "not happy about the changing face of this country and the cuts that are happening".
Although at the forefront of the previous march, Ms Church chose a less prominent role on Saturday and decided to stay among the crowds.
At the first march the mother of two addressed around 200 campaigners on Queen Street and carried a placard which read she was "mad as hell".
Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies hit back at Ms Church's comments, calling them "unfortunate and unbecoming", and describing her as "champagne socialist".
