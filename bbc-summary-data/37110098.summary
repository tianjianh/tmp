The exploits of cycling's golden couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny helped boost ratings for the BBC's Olympic coverage to a new high on Tuesday.

More than 11 million were watching BBC One at 22:00 BST when Trott received her Olympic gold medal for the omnium.
The same figure - 11.1 million - turned in one hour later to see Kenny, Trott's fiance, win the men's keirin.
Coverage of the Rio Olympics, which run until Sunday, has also helped give BBC Four record ratings.
Before Tuesday night's events, the highest viewing figures for the Rio Olympics came on Sunday.
That was reached when an average of 10.4 million watched gymnast Max Whitlock receive his second gold medal.
Ratings for the Rio Olympics have been generally lower compared with London 2012, due to the time difference between the UK and Brazil.
In 2012, 20 million people tuned in to see Usain Bolt win the men's 100m final when it aired on 5 August at 21:50 BST.
