For urban transit operators, its algorithms aim to reveal how crowded commuter buses and trains are on their network, and how long are customers waiting on station platforms - information which until now has not been readily accessible.
It plans to license its so-called "space/time" model to operators in cities around the globe.
It also has just launched a consumer app that uses offline maps and data to let users figure out the best way to navigate around 11 cities - those in which transit operators employ Urban Engines' system.
As well as bringing up a "tabbed" view of expected transit times on favourite routes, it also uses the smartphone's built-in sensors to show an augmented reality view of how to navigate effectively, even when the user is offline.
But how does it rank against mapping giants like Google - the former employer of Urban Engine founder Shiva Shivakumar?
He explained how the system works to the BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor.
