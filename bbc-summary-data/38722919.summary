'Documenting Histories' will look at the impact of South Asian culture on Birmingham and the Midlands, 70 years after India declared its independence.
Official records from the East India Company will also be available.
The exhibition is being put on by the Library of Birmingham and the British Library, who have been given Â£91,700 from the Heritage Lottery fund.
According to the 2011 census, 9% of Birmingham's population was born in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan - numbering about 85,000 people.

Workshops and other events will be held throughout the year to get families to show how the relationship between the UK and the region has shaped their lives.
Birmingham City Council has declared 2017 as the Year of South Asian Culture to celebrate the impact of communities from the region.
Vanessa Harbar, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in the West Midlands, said the "fascinating and timely project" would allow people to "gain a better understanding" of Birmingham's history.
Ian Ward, deputy leader of the city council, said: "This year, in particular, presents a great opportunity to celebrate the contribution of South Asian culture to Birmingham's past, present and future."
The exhibition will open in July.
