[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
European Champions Cup holders Saracens will host three-time winners Toulon in a pool decider on Saturday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark McCall's side are one of four to have already qualified for the quarter-finals, but victory at Allianz Park would secure them a home draw.
Munster, Leinster and ASM Clermont Auvergne have also already progressed.
Glasgow can go through as best runner-up if they beat Leicester, while Wasps will secure their place in the knockout stages if they win at Zebre on Sunday.
However, a losing bonus point may also be enough for the Scottish side to reach the last eight for the first time.
Exeter travel to Top 14 leaders Clermont and remain in contention for a best runner-up spot, along with Bordeaux-Begles, who visit Ulster.
Munster can guarantee a home quarter-final if they beat Racing 92, while victory against Toulouse would see Connacht progress.
On Friday, Montpellier boosted their hopes of a best runner-up spot by beating Northampton, who were already eliminated, while pool winners Leinster - who will be at home in the quarter-finals unless all the other four group winners overtake them - drew at Castres.
