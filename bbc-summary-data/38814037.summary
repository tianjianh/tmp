[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberystwyth University launches bilingual app

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Aberystwyth University has launched a bilingual app so students can check their lecture timetables and see which computers are available.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
ApAber has been designed to bring together a range of Welsh and English services on one screen.
It lets students check their network usage and attendance records, see bus transport timetables and how much they may owe in library fines.
Urgent messages can be posted, such as if lectures are cancelled due to snow.
It was piloted as MyAber at the beginning of the 2016-17 academic term and has already been downloaded by more than 5,000 students and staff members.
