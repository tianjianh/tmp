The plans for a four-year consent for the Rec Ground include building spectator stands along the north and eastern sides of the playing field.
They also show new hospitality boxes around the south stand and a scoreboard between the north and east stands.
A decision by Banes Council is expected at the end of February 2016.
The Rec has been the spiritual and historic home of Bath Rugby Club since 1894.
The Premiership club, which leases the ground from the Recreation Ground Trust, wants to redevelop the Rec to increase capacity and provide better facilities for supporters.
The club said the application will provide an "interim solution" while the trust clarifies its rights with regard to the operation of the site.
