Police in Zimbabwe have arrested the editor of a state-owned newspaper who was appointed two months ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sunday Mail editor Edmund Kudzayi was detained after computers were seized from his office on Thursday.
A police spokeswoman told the state-owned Herald paper that he was being held over articles he had written.
Earlier this month President Robert Mugabe accused his information minister of using state-owned media to sow divisions in the ruling Zanu-PF party.
Correspondents say there is tension in the party over who should succeed 90-year-old Mr Mugabe, who was re-elected president last year.
Mr Kudzayi was among several newspaper editors recently appointed by Information Minister Jonathan Moyo.
Mr Mugabe had referred to Mr Moyo as the "devil incarnate" for firing editors at state-owned newspapers who were loyal to Zanu-PF.
Mr Moyo has fallen in and out of favour with Mr Mugabe and was re-appointed as his information minister last September.
