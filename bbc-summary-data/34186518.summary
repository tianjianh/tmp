Bath head coach Mike Ford has signed a new four-year contract with the Premiership club.

Ford, who initially joined as defence coach in 2012, is joined by backroom staff Toby Booth, Darren Edwards and Neal Hatley in agreeing new deals.
Under Ford's guidance Bath reached the 2015 Premiership final but lost 28-16 to Saracens at Twickenham.
"I'm absolutely delighted, I love this place," the 49-year-old told BBC Radio Bristol.
Former London Irish boss Booth, one-time Exiles prop Hatley and ex-England defence coach Ford arrived at The Rec in May 2012 to work under director of rugby Gary Gold.
Bath finished seventh in the Premiership in their first year at the club and were sitting third in the table in December when Gold was dismissed from his role, with Ford taking over at the helm.
Having committed their futures to Bath for at least four years, Ford now wants the club to win some silverware during his tenure.
"In four years' time I want us to have a few trophies," he said. "I want us to have won the European Cup - the Champions Cup - and to have won the Premiership."
Ford also paid tribute to his fellow coaches as an integral part of Bath's recent turnaround.
"What we've done over the past couple of years as a team and what we've achieved make it a great place to work," he said.
"For me to go for another four years gives me the continuity I want and the players can see that.
"We are all very ambitious and we are all on the same page in terms of the way we play. We share the same philosophy and the players seem to enjoy it."
