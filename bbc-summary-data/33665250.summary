[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two British men who were killed when their car crashed off a mountain road in Austria were "like brothers", one of their mothers has said.

Danny Hall, 25, and Josh Robinson, 22, both from Kent, came off Austria's highest mountain pass, Grossglockner High Alpine Road, on Friday morning.
Mr Robinson's mother, Jennifer, said it felt like she had "lost two sons".
Mr Hall's mother, Michelle, said the pair were "two lovely lads" who shared "a special bond".
Mr Robinson's father, Marcus, said Josh was "kind, gentle, loving" and dreamt of becoming a Top Gear presenter.
"That was a little dream he had. They made videos and practised. The boys together were very amusing. I think they would have made fantastic presenters," he said.
"He really was a good person, such a lovely person. If I could honestly be half the man he was in his short life then I'd be happy."
Mrs Robinson said: "Josh meant more than the world to me."
Mr Hall was "like a son", she added. "They were like brothers. It feels like I have lost two sons."
The pair had been taking part in the Great European Rally, an eight-day drive through seven countries, beginning in Belgium and finishing in Hungary.
Police said the driver lost control of the pair's Seat Leon while driving about 8,000ft (2,400m) above sea level. Both men were pronounced dead at the scene.
Mr Hall's mother, Michelle, said her son was a "bubbly character" who "lived life to the max".
She said: "Everywhere he went he would put a smile on anyone's face."
Mr Hall's parents said he had been excited about taking part in the Great European Rally and had repeatedly told friends and family he was "loving life".
In the last text he sent to his mother he said the rally had been one of the best experiences of his life and one he would "treasure forever", Mrs Hall said.
Of the friendship of the two young men, Mr Hall's father, Brian, said: "They just had the same sense of humour and they loved cars. If you watch their videos they rubbed off on each other all the time."
Mrs Hall added that the pair had known what they were doing and had not been taking part in a race, as police in Salzburg had at first suggested.
Officers have since said the pair were not racing before the crash and are treating it as an accident.
"They were two sensible lads, two lovely lads that had a special bond together and we want to get them home together," she added.
The pair had filmed updates and spoken of the dangers of the trip on social media before they died.
Mr Robinson's father said they had known about the some of the roads on the trip being "notorious for accidents".
He added: "As a father I thought don't be silly, be careful. But he was a young man with his own business about to purchase his own house.
"His age was more like 25-26 than 22. He was very mature for his age."
Mr Robinson, a civil engineer, had a love of cars and extreme sports and was a self-taught mechanic, his father said.
He said he could have imagined his son taking part in further car rallies if he had not been killed.
Mr Robinson's father said the pair had been wearing their seat belts at the time of the accident.
Since the pair were killed, there has been an outpouring of tributes on both of their Facebook pages.
Mrs Hall said it was "touching" so many people cared about the two men.
Now both families are in the process of trying to bring the bodies of the two men home.
"We want them home as soon as. If we can speed things up in any way shape or form, the process, we will do it because we want our baby back," Mrs Hall added.
