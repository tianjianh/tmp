Evans's breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 dropped by 414,000 listeners compared with the previous quarter to 9.06 million.
But the programme remained the most popular radio show in the UK.
Grimshaw attracted 5.25 million weekly listeners between July and September, dropping 184,000 on the last quarter.
The drops are likely to be down to fewer people listening to breakfast shows during the summer months.
But digital station BBC Radio 6 Music attracted a new record audience of 2.34 million listeners.
It is the fifth consecutive quarter that the digital station has scored record ratings.
Helen Boaden, Director of BBC Radio, said she was "delighted that more and more people are discovering the station's irresistible combination of outstanding alternative music and witty presenters".
While Grimshaw's figures were down, Radio 1 as a whole went up, from 9.46 million last quarter to 9.87 million weekly listeners between July and September.
The figure rose further to 10.9 million when listeners aged 10 to 14 were included in the data. The station is currently trying to attract a younger audience.
Ben Cooper, controller of Radio 1, said the figures "should be seen alongside the increase to 1.5 million views a day on our YouTube channel and our 8.5 million users on social media".
BBC Radio 4 posted a weekly reach of 11.2 million, its second highest audience to date.
The network's flagship Today programme dropped 250,000 listeners to 7.1 million but its sister programme The World At One reached an all-time high of 3.75 million.
In commercial radio, LBC, Heart and Capital all increased their number of weekly listeners compared with the previous quarter - while Absolute Radio added more than half a million.
The breakfast shows on Classic FM and talkSPORT increased their reach nationally, but several commercial breakfast programmes dropped listeners.
Kiss's Rickie, Melvin and Charlie dropped from 2.13 million national listeners in the last quarter to to 1.83 million between July and September.
The Chris Moyles breakfast show on Radio X lost 36,000 listeners in London but increased the overall number listeners across the UK - reaching 703,000.
But Capital's breakfast show, hosted by Dave Berry, George Shelley and Lilah Parsons, dropped slightly, but remained the most popular commercial breakfast show in the UK.
Overall, Rajar - the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK - said 89% of British people - or 48.2 million adults - listened to the radio at least once a week over the quarter, an increase of 320,000 on last year.
