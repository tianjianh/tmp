The Welsh boxer, who competed in Rio last summer at lightweight, will make his professional debut on the undercard of Martin Murray's clash with Gabriel Rosado.
Now fighting as a super featherweight, Cordina, 25, is hopeful of fighting up to eight times this year.
"I just want to put on a good show and excite the fans," Cordina said.
The former Commonwealth Games bronze medallist has changed his regime since turning professional, leaving the Newport gym where he trained with Tony Borg for several years to switch to Essex and Tony Sims' Matchroom gym.
Cordina is settling well into his new surroundings, even with a famous new roommate for company.
"It's all new to me but I'm enjoying it," added Cordina.
"I wanted to have a change and learn something new, Tony Sims is one of the best trainers out there and I wanted to be with him and in that gym.
"Tony is well respected in boxing and such a great guy, it was a big decision to make but I think I've made the right one.
"I'm living with Ricky Burns in Essex, he's doing the same thing as me, home at the weekends but miles from home during the week, and he's a three-weight world champion, I want to be where he is and that's what I am trying to replicate.
"I miss my daughter, she's only young and I want to see her grow up every day, but you have to make sacrifices in this sport.
"It's the hardest thing for me to do but I've spent a lot of time away as part of the GB squad so I am used to it."
Cordina would like to follow in the footsteps of one of his former stable mates - IBF world featherweight champion Lee Selby.
"Being a part of Tony Borg's stable for many years and we still get on great," he said.
"I've seen how far Lee has gone on and learnt a lot training by the side of him.
"Lee has gone on to do great things for Welsh boxing and that's a massive target that I've set myself, to achieve great things just like Lee has done."
