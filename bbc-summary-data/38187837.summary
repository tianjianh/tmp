[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
PC Lisa Bates lost a finger, suffered a deep wound to her head, a fractured skull and a smashed ankle during the attack in Sheffield in April.
Nathan Sumner, 35, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent but was cleared of attempted murder in October.
Sentencing Sumner at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Julian Goose QC said he had mounted a "sustained attack".

PC Bates and a fellow officer, PC Mark Garrett, were responding to a reported disturbance at Sumner's flat on Plowright Close when they were attacked.
She told the court during Sumner's trial he had shouted aggressively as he answered the door and then attacked PC Garrett.
PC Bates was then attacked with the axe but was eventually pulled to safety by a neighbour of Sumner.
Sumner fled the scene and was arrested later in a supermarket where, wearing only a pair of shorts, he had smashed bottles and thrown things at shoppers and staff members.
The court heard he had suffered from a psychotic episode.
David Brooke, for Sumner, said he was "profoundly ill at the time" and was full of "remorse" for his actions.
Prosecutor Samuel Green read a statement on behalf of PC Bates to the court.
"The events of that day changed my life forever," she said.
"Scarring to my leg and hand acts as a constant reminder of what happened.
"I continue to suffer from dizziness, headaches, nausea, nightmares and flashbacks.
"I am suffering from a loss of earnings and I have had to cancel both my wedding and honeymoon.
"It's only through luck and good fortune that I survived."
Sumner was sentenced to 15 years in prison, with an extended sentence of five years, and was also given a hospital order.
