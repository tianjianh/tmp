A cyclist who was seen kicking a 19-month-old girl in Edinburgh is being sought by police.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened on the cycle path near Leith Links on Saturday at about 16:30 when a passing cyclist deliberately kicked the little girl.
The toddler was walking with her father and both had moved out of the way to give the cyclist room.
The cyclist was white, in his mid 20s and of medium build. He was clean-shaven and had dark scruffy hair.
He also had dark circles under his eyes.
He was wearing dark jeans and a black hooded jacket, and was riding a silver mountain bike.
Officers are now urging witnesses to come forward.
Sgt Mark Wilson, of Police Scotland, said: "Thankfully the child was not seriously injured but this was still a distressing and inexplicable incident.
"We are keen to speak to anyone with information that can help us with our inquiries and assist us to trace this suspect."
