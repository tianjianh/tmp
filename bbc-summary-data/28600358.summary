[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Wokingham schools plans to be developed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two new schools could be built in Wokingham to meet rising demand for pupil places.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A new 420-place primary school is planned for the Montague Park housing development, with a Â£17m secondary school proposed for Arborfield.
The borough council's executive committee has approved the development of the Arborfield scheme proposals.
It has also agreed that potential sponsors be invited to express interest in running the Montague Park school.
The report about the Arborfield secondary school plans, said the Department for Education (DfE) guidance indicates it would cost Â£17m to build.
It said projections indicate a new school would be "viable and necessary" to serve the south of the borough by 2016. The school would be either a Free School or an Academy, it added.
Under the Montague Park school proposal, there would be an option to create up to 630 pupil places, the report stated.
