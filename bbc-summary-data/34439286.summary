BBC News website readers have been sharing their experience of the unexpected and heavy rainfall.
"I saw the storm last night and I have never seen anything so bad. The rain was worse than anything I've even seen in a monsoon shower.
"My friend and I were planning to watch the rugby in a bar, but soon realised the weather was too bad to go out. The TV started to flicker until it stopped completely and the WiFi went too.
"The lights were constantly going on and off and friends were saying they had no power at all." - Eliza Fleming, Cannes
"We wanted to go out but decided not to as the rain was unbelievably heavy. There was a lot of lightning in quick succession. Our apartment is on the ground floor.
"We could see the water rising very quickly. We opened the door and there was a huge gust of wind. It was terrifying.
Today it is calm and there are clear blue skies." - Katya Higham-Stoianova, Cannes
Julia Huber tweeted this picture of the flooding in Cannes
"I'm in Cannes. The rain on Saturday night was amazing.
The immediate result was that from around 2230, the internet failed completely everywhere. No card machines could be used to pay restaurant bills.
On Sunday, none of the cash machines in Cannes were operating." - Gerry Buckland
