Is the NHS better since devolution and has the Welsh government delivered on its promises?
Firstly Dr Alan Rees, of the Royal College of Physicians, said there has been huge improvements over recent decades but the health service has been a victim of its own success.
Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones AM argues that the NHS and health boards have failed to manage their finances.
Dr Tony Calland, of the British Medical Association, said the Welsh government had done its best but had underestimated the problems.
