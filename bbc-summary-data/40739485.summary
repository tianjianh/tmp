Abrahams has previously worked under Reds coach Neil Tunnah and Australia boss Michael Cheika in his homeland.
The 22-year-old played seven games for Hartpury College last season as they gained promotion to the second tier.
Quarrie, 29, has played in New Zealand, Spain and France and also had a spell at Birmingham & Solihull in 2012.
The new arrivals come after Reds chairman Mark Morgan told BBC Radio Jersey they have had to make "significant" cuts to their playing budget this summer.
