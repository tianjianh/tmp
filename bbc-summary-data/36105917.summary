About 1,000 people attended a rave at Twyford Wood near Bourne in Lincolnshire on 23 May.
Police carried out an operation to close it down, which led to 21 officers and a dog being injured.
Chelsea Harvey, 21, from Norfolk, admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for 12 months.
Harvey, of Ashley Walk, Dereham, drove her Peugeot 206 about 350 metres (1,148ft) at speeds of up to 30mph (77km/h) with PC Rob Bentley on the bonnet, Lincoln Crown Court heard.
At one point she was involved in a collision with a camper van, but continued with the officer still clinging on.
PC Bentley suffered "relatively minor physical injuries" but the court heard the psychological damage had had a lasting impact.
James Bide-Thomas, prosecuting, said Harvey, who had two female friends in her car, had been told to stop by PC Bentley, but instead had "jerked forward violently" knocking the officer off his feet and leaving him "spread-eagled" on the bonnet.
Judge Michael Heath, passing sentence on Wednesday, told her: "If you drive as you did with a police officer on your bonnet for the distance that you did, and at the speed you did, there can only be one sentence that I can impose upon you. That is immediate custody."
Jonathan Straw, defending, said Harvey works in a centre for deaf-blind people run by the charity Sense.
He described her as acting in "blind panic" and added: "She is very sorry for what happened. She didn't intend to hurt anyone. She went out with two friends that day simply to enjoy a party."
Harvey was also disqualified from driving for a year.
