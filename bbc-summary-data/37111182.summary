Tinkler, 16, will collect her English, French and Maths results from Durham High School the day after getting home.
She has become only the third British woman to win an individual gymnastics medal with her Rio exploits.
"It's starting to sink in now I've got the results when I get back," Tinkler told BBC Tees.
"I've had a lot of media interest since the event, and I keep being reminded of it. But I want to live it up here while I can.
"We're now hoping to watch a few sports, my team-mates are going to the beach and we're hoping to go to Sugarloaf Mountain before we go as well."
The Bishop Auckland athlete, the youngest member of the Team GB squad, had been juggling 30 hours of training a week with her exam studies in the build up to the Games.
"My school have been incredible, with helping me out," she added.
"I've split my GCSEs over three years. I did PE last year, and I'll finish off the rest next year."
Although Tinkler is assured of her place in Olympic folklore with her debut Games success, life among the elite competitors in the athletes' village has had a novelty value.
She said: "The other day I passed Greg Rutherford in the village and he said 'Hi, good luck for the floor final' - it was like 'Oh my gosh!'
"It was so crazy and amazing. Being a block with such amazing athletes such as Andy Murray and Greg is like 'Wow'.
"I met Tom Daley and that was incredible."
