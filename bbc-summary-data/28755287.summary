The leasing deal completes the first phase of the 40-acre business park development, which is located opposite the entrance to Aberdeen International Airport.
Abstract said it was looking to bring forward the next phases of the business park "at an early stage".
When completed, the park will comprise of about 1,000,000 sq ft of offices, and is likely to include at least one hotel.
Mark Glatman, from Abstract, said: "The position of the Aberdeen International Business Park adjacent to Aberdeen International Airport, the quality of the development and the developing local road infrastructure makes this business park an obvious and logical location for major international companies active in the Aberdeen market."
