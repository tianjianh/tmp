Lord McConnell falls down drain in Malawi

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Scottish first minister has fallen down a drain while walking in the dark in Malawi.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord McConnell was in the African country to discuss the importance of electricity at the time.
He tweeted: "Spent the evening discussing the importance of better electricity for #Malawi. Walked out to the dark street and fell down a drain. #Ouch".
Jack McConnell served as first minister between 2001 and 2007.
He signed a co-operation agreement between Scotland and Malawi in 2005, and continues to be a regular visitor to the east African country.
It appears the Labour peer escaped injury after his stumble - but his admission sparked a flurry of responses on social media.
Twitter user @nowayjomo suggested: "Proved your point then?" while @itsjustlewis pondered: "fell down? or stumbled? Too many pints ;) but yes, funny how issues are like this are overlooked. Oan yersel".
