Police were called to reports of a stabbing on a 149 bus on Stoke Newington Road just before 14.00 BST on Tuesday.
The victim, in his 20s, was taken to a nearby hospital but later discharged. No arrests have been made.
An eyewitness told the BBC the two passengers had been arguing for a while when a fight broke out "suddenly".
"It was only when they began struggling we could see that one man was trying to wrestle the knife off the other," the witness said.
