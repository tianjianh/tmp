Why are we posting our first profile pictures again on Facebook?

It will either remind you of a time when you were younger and better looking or bring back how bad your hair (and camera phone) really was.

We're talking the latest thing everyone's doing on Facebook - resurrecting their first profile picture.
Timelines are filling up with fresh-faced snaps, with nominations for who should go next. But no-one really knows why.
Unlike the no make-up selfie and Ice Bucket Challenge - which were linked to raising awareness for a charity - this craze has no obvious hook.
Facebook is about to turn 11 so many of us now have a lot of history on the site. So are we just getting nostalgic for that time in 2008 when we had blue hair?
Whatever the reason, we give you a glimpse of what Facebook might look like right now - if you were mates with these famous faces.
Note: Not real. Definitely Photoshopped. Got it?
Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton has worked hard on his image.
Here he is in 2009 (he posted this after he was apparently punched) and then this year heading into the current series of Celebrity Big Brother.
Emma Watson first entered the limelight in 2000 when she was  cast as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films.
These days, she's a regular on the celebrity circuit and models alongside her acting.
Prime Minister David Cameron looks like he's posing for his school photo in this publicity shot from his election campaign in 2001.
Justin Bieber can now be seen tattooed and muscular in photo shoots, but here he is all cute and boyish at Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2010. Only four years ago.
We managed to find not one, but two photos of Victoria Beckham smiling.
Here she is as Posh all the way back in 2000 and picking up an award forfashion in 2014.
Phillip Schofield first hit our screens around the time of your birth. His hair is a little greyer now but we salute whatever is in his skin care regime.
