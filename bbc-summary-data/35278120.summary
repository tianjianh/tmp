Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Twitter account hacked

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A series of foul-mouthed posts have been published on Jeremy Corbyn's Twitter feed following the apparent hacking of the Labour leader's account.

The infiltration began shortly after 21:00 GMT, and at least four messages were broadcast to his 384,000 followers.
One mocked Prime Minister David Cameron by stating: "davey cameron is a pie".
Mr Corbyn's team quickly regained control of the @jeremycorbyn account and the offending tweets were deleted.
The Labour leader mostly tweets about party policy so the first of the hacked messages, which began "Here we... here we..." and contained three exclamation marks, would have alerted his followers to the fact that something was not quite right.
A minute later, the hacker posted the message about Mr Cameron, followed almost immediately by one which poked fun at Mr Corbyn's opposition to the Trident nuclear missile programme.
