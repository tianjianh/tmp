[SN]TITLE[SN]
Llanelli man fined for painting birthday greeting on road

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man's birthday greeting cost him £600 - because he painted it on the road in his street.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Nigel Dallimore admitted painting the message, "Happy birthday Zoe M love from Dai", in Grant Street, Llanelli, in July last year.
He agreed to pay a fixed penalty of £75, but was taken before Llanelli magistrates by Carmarthenshire council after failing to pay.
He was fined £220, plus £351 costs and £30 victim surcharge.
Jim Jones of Carmarthenshire council said: "Graffiti can be expensive to clear off as specialist products may have to be used to remove the paint in an environmentally-friendly way.
"Out of the costs awarded, £220 is going to pay for the cost of removing this message from the road."
