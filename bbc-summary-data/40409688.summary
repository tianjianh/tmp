The 22-year-old made 20 appearances last season while on loan with the Grecians, who were beaten by Blackpool in the League Two play-off final.
He featured three times for Exeter's Devon rivals Plymouth during a loan spell in the 2015-16 campaign.
"Even at the back end of last season, when I wasn't playing that much, I wanted to stay at Exeter," Croll said.
