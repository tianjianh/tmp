[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Lee Irwin grabbed a stoppage-time winner as Oldham won at Northampton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John-Joe O'Toole cancelled out Tope Obadeyi's first-half opener late in the game but Irwin came off the bench to bag the winner and keep Oldham three points above the League One relegation zone.
Both sides had early chances, O'Toole tested Connor Ripley while Obadeyi fired wide at the other end before Ryan McLaughlin shot over.
O'Toole should have given Cobblers the lead after Keshi Anderson set him up but he allowed Ripley to make a routine save.
And moments later Ripley denied Anderson in a one-on-one situation before then keeping out Michael Smith's header.
The visitors took a 23rd-minute lead when Aaron Holloway got into the box and set up Obadeyi who finished from close range.
Hiram Boateng shot wide before Smith missed a great chance to equalise when he volleyed wide from Neal Eardley's cross and Anderson was denied by Ripley.
Both sides had chances early in the second half. Anderson was again denied by Ripley, as was Boateng, while Holloway was thwarted by Adam Smith who then dealt with Aiden O'Neill's header.
O'Toole snatched an 84th-minute equaliser, netting from close range after substitute Marc Richards was thwarted.
But Oldham's late pressure paid off in stoppage time when Irwin fired into the bottom corner from the edge of the box.
