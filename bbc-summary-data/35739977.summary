Police Scotland said a report would be sent to prosecutors about football-related disorder at the match in Dingwall.
Match commander Colin Gough said the disorder was "disappointing" and that more arrests were possible.
Dundee United won the match 3-2 after a late goal by Billy Mckay.
Ch Insp Gough said:  "It is disappointing that a small minority of fans were involved in disorder in the ground.
"Disruptive behaviour will not be tolerated in any format.  Inquiries are continuing and there is potential for further arrests."
