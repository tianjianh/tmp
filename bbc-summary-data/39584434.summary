The 22-year-old will become Wigan's second marquee player, alongside full-back Sam Tomkins, under the new salary caps rules which start next season.
Warriors said they had turned down offers from Super League and NRL sides for the England international.
"Wigan is in my heart and where I want to be," said Williams.
"I was close (to leaving) but I kept coming back to this is where I want to be, this is where I want to win trophies."
Under the terms of the contract, Williams, who came through the club's academy and was named Super League's young player of the year in 2015, will be able to leave Wigan at the end of the 2020 season if a "pre-defined substantial transfer fee" is met.
Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan said: "The recently agreed additional changes to the current salary cap rules were designed specifically to help keep elite talent in Super League.
"We realise that George is a big part of our future moving further and look forward to seeing him in a Wigan shirt for many years to come."
Coach Shaun Wane added: "George is one of the best up-and-coming players in the sport. It's a huge shot in the arm, not only for Wigan but also for Super League."
