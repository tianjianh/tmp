Eamonn Burns will remain as Down manager for another year but Fermanagh boss Pete McGrath could quit after the weekend qualifier defeat by Mayo.

Down have ratified Burns for the 2017 campaign despite losing all their league and championship games.
Former Mourne boss McGrath has been in charge of Fermanagh since 2013.
"I need to consider what I want to do for 2017, what the players want and how I can push the team forward or if a new face is needed," he said.
"To be honest I have put in two years of hard work and it does take up a lot of time managing any side whether that be club or country," McGrath added in a county board statement to the Irish News.
McGrath was irate at the decision by referee Joe McQuillan to award Mayo a controversial penalty in the 2-14 to 1-12 loss at McHale Park.
James McCartan will continue as Down minors boss but Frank Dawson will not manage the U21 side next year, with his replacement yet to be confirmed.
