[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Norman Jones, 81, of Pentre Halkyn, said he could not explain what happened and put it down to his dementia.
Pleading guilty by letter, he apologised and said this crash made it clear he is no longer fit to drive.
Magistrates, who are considering a driving ban, adjourned sentence for two weeks for Jones to be present.
The incident happened shortly before 11:00 BST on 7 December, 2013, in Mold town centre.
Prosecutor Shaun Bartlett-Evans said ten pedestrians were injured when Jones's Citroen Picasso entered the pedestrian section of the high street during the twice-weekly market, which was busy with shoppers.
Witnesses described how the defendant, with his wife in the passenger seat, came down the high street and overtook two cars which were parked at the traffic lights.
With the engine said to be revving, he pulled out to avoid hitting the cars ahead, drove through the junction and careered into the pedestrianised area where the market was being held.
The vehicle collided with market stalls and pedestrians.
Three women were injured; one suffered serious leg injuries which resulted in seven pins being inserted and may require a knee replacement; a second broke her leg and ankle while a third suffered broken ribs, an ankle injury and bruising.
Six other women and a man were also hurt.
In his letter pleading guilty, Jones, who previously has a clean driving licence, said he had been diagnosed with memory loss and dementia some 18 months ago.
He said he was still at a loss to understand what happened and could only assume that it was associated with his medical condition.
He has since  given up his licence.
Magistrates said that it was a serious matter with a high degree of culpability, there were serious circumstances surrounding the case and the defendant was needed in court to be sentenced.
