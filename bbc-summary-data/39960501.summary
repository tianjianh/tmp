The ex-Wycombe and Accrington midfielder suffered two serious knee injuries during his time at the club.
Full-back Liam Wakefield, 23, is also released by Morecambe.
Michael Rose, Kevin Ellison, Barry Roche, Aaron Wildig, Alex Kenyon, Paul Mullin and Ryan Edwards have been offered new contracts.
Andy Fleming and Lee Molynuex are also in talks with the Shrimps.
"On the eve of my most recent operation to repair a new injury sustained in the game against Wycombe I was informed over the phone that I was to be released," Murphy said on Twitter.
"I was informed by the surgeon the very next day that the injury I sustained is career ending.
"I feel fortunate to have played the game I love for a living for the time that I have."
Earlier this week, Diego Lemos' ownership claim to Morecambe was dismissed with tax consultant Graham Burnard announced as sole director.
