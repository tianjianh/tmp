Wolves have increased their goalkeeping options by signing Andy Lonergan from Championship rivals Fulham.

The 32-year-old has agreed a two-year deal at Molineux, with the club having an option for an extra 12 months.
He began his career at Preston and had spells with Leeds and Bolton before joining the Whites in June 2015, making 31 appearances last season.
Lonergan will compete with Carl Ikeme and Jon Flatt for the number one shirt at Molineux.
The financial terms of the deal have not been disclosed.
"Wolves is a massive club and one of those when you play them you always know it is going to be a tough game and the atmosphere is fantastic, " Lonergan told the club's website.
"To be part of that, and hopefully a successful team at Molineux, is something I am looking forward to.
"In my opinion Carl is comfortably one of the top three keepers in the league. It is up to me to put pressure on him."
Wolves failed to mount a serious challenge for promotion last season under head coach Kenny Jackett, finishing in 14th place, 16 points outside the play-offs.
