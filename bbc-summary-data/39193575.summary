After hosting the British Science Festival last year the university wants to capitalise on its success.
Visitors will be able to see demonstrations and workshops based on everyday science through to the latest cutting-edge innovations.
"We continue to inspire the next generation of scientists," said Professor Hilary Lappin-Scott.
The university's senior pro-vice-chancellor added hosting the British Science Festival was an "enormous success" and she wants it to create a "science legacy for Swansea".
It brought tens of thousands of people to the city to celebrate developments and talk about issues affecting our culture and society.
The new festival will be held at the city's National Waterfront Museum from 8-10 September.
