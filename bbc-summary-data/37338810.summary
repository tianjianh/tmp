[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Stanton, a 58-year-old from Thornton, Merseyside, was shot by two men who burst into Aintree Commercial Vehicles in Thornton on 24 July 2006.
They fled the scene in a stolen blue Toyota Avensis car, registration DM53 MKK, which was later found burnt out.
Police are still offering a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of his killers.
The vehicle, taken from Sefton Street, Liverpool, on 25 May 2006, was discovered on Blindfoot Road, Rainford.
Det Ch Insp Dave Brunskill of Merseyside Police said: "Ten years have passed since the murder of James Stanton and his wife Jean and family are still suffering from their loss.
"They can't rest until those responsible for his death are arrested, charged and brought before the courts."
He said officers were continuing to appeal to anyone who may have seen the car between 25 May and the night of the murder, although the car may not have been displaying its original number plates at the time of the killing.
He added: "I'm hoping that with the passing of time, someone watching tonight's show might find it in them to come forward and help [James'] family get some form of closure."
Mr Stanton had four children and nine grandchildren.
