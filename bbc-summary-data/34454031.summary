It's Carwyn Jones or me for Wales, Andrew RT Davies says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Tories are the only party that will not "prop up" another five years of Labour rule in Wales under Carwyn Jones, the Welsh Tory leader has said

Andrew RT Davies told party activists: "It's me, or him. The maths is simple - only the Conservatives can do it."
He said the 2016 election offered the chance to end 17 years of Labour Welsh government, and create a "new Wales".
Earlier, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Wales was "letting go of Labour" as people said "enough is enough".
Mr Davies told the Conservative party conference, in Manchester, the assembly election offered a chance to "smash" the "cosy consensus" in Wales.
The Welsh Conservative party, he argued, was Wales' "anti-establishment party".
"We are the real party of Wales. And we are the alternative.
"We're the only party that won't prop up another five more years of Labour rule.
"And only the Welsh Conservatives can stop Carwyn Jones becoming first minister again."
"It's me, or him."
Mr Davies said the May 2016 poll would also be a referendum on the Welsh NHS, promising the Tories would "invest in more paramedics, in better access to cancer treatments, in more accountability and in better patient choice".
He promised new measures to cut waiting times, improve care, and provide "more patient-friendly services".
On education, Mr Davies said that sending school budgets directly to schools, rather than via local authorities, "could mean hundreds of thousands more pounds reaching the frontline in every single school".
He also promised to start a "small business revolution", including plans to reduce business rates for smaller firms, provide "localised access to finance" and revive high streets.
Speaking earlier, Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb insisted Wales had "had enough" of the "stuffy Welsh Labour establishment taking their communities and their voters for granted".
He said new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn may think he is "coming home to 'Real Labour' when he visits Wales .... where he can see a Welsh Labour government that has banned academies and banned free schools and abolished Right to Buy".
"But he will also see that Wales is letting go of Labourâ€¦. as people across Wales say 'enough is enough.'"
