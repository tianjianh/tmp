Adebayor, 32, a free agent since his contract expired with Crystal Palace last summer, will be making his fifth appearance at the tournament.
Veteran goalkeeper Kossi Agassa, 38, is another player currently without a club named in the squad for Gabon.
But coach Claude LeRoy has left out Nigeria-based Joseph Douhadji and Victor Nukafu.
Fulham midfielder Floyd Ayite was included as was another Europe-based forward Ihlas Bebou of German Bundesliga side Fortuna Düsseldorf.
LeRoy, who guided Cameroon to the 1988 Nations Cup title and has only failed to reach the quarter-finals once, has also included three players from the domestic league.
Togo reached the quarter-finals for the first time in the 2013 edition in South Africa but failed to qualify for the last tournament in Equatorial Guinea.
The Sparrow Hawks will kick off the tournament against defending champions Ivory Coast on 16 January, before facing Group C rivals Morocco and DR Congo.
The tournament runs from 14 January to 5 February.
