The Unite and GMB unions have claimed there has not been enough consultation on moves by members of the Offshore Contractors Association (OCA) to change rota patterns in a bid to cut costs.
Talks were held with the OCA in Aberdeen on Wednesday.
In a statement, the unions said both sides would consider fresh proposals before fresh talks on 20 May.
