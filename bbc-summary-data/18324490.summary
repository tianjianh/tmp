The Belgium international, 21, has agreed personal terms and passed a medical with the Blues.
Jan 1991: Born in La Louviere, Belgium
Nov 2007: Makes first-team debut for Lille in 2-0 defeat by Nancy
Nov 2008: Given his first cap for Belgium, aged 18, in a substitute appearance against Luxembourg
Sept 2008: Becomes Lille's youngest-ever goalscorer with a strike against Auxerre in 3-2 win
May 2010: Wins Young Player of the Year award for a second time, the first player to do so
May 2011: Helps Lille win a league and cup double, as well as winning Player of the Year
Oct 2011: Notches first international goal for Belgium
May 2012: Wins Player of the Year again after scoring 17 league goals
"When they won the Champions League I told myself, 'Why not Chelsea?'," said Hazard.
"There was a struggle between Chelsea and [Manchester] United but, for me, Chelsea has the best project. It's a wonderful club."
Chelsea are reportedly paying Â£32m to sign the talented youngster, who added on French radio station RMC: "The [Chelsea] team is young and I have a better chance to play there.
"If I play well enough at Chelsea, I could win my place in the starting team."
Hazard won the league and cup double with Lille in 2010-11 and, in his final season at the Ligue 1 club, he scored 21 goals in 48 games.
Hazard signed off by scoring a hat-trick in his final game against Nancy last month.
But he failed to live up to his reputation when producing a quiet performance as Belgium lost to England at Wembley on Saturday. His appearance took his tally to 28 caps.
He joins Germany international Marko Marin as a second major new addition to the Chelsea squad since the January transfer window.
