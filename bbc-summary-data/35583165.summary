The 17-year-old, presently with Tippeligaen club Start, will stay overnight in the city to undergo a medical and discuss personal terms.
The Norway youth international spent a week on trial with Celtic last month and has now been offered a contract.
"I'm really happy. I enjoyed it last time," Ajer told BBC Scotland after landing at Glasgow Airport.
"It's a big club, so we will see what will happen and tomorrow I will talk to them more."
Ajer had flown from Alicante, where he had been at a pre-season training camp in La Manga, but was not daunted by the cold, driving rain that greeted him in Scotland.
"Yes, I love it," he said. "I'm from Norway, so it's no problem."
Ajer is the youngest player to captain a team in the Tippeligaen, which is presently in its close season.
Start finished third bottom of the Norwegian top flight in 2015 but won their promotion/relegation play-off final against Jerv.
Now Ajer is poised to move to the Scottish champions, where he will work under compatriot Ronny Deila.
"It'll be fun," the midfielder said of his forthcoming talks with the Celtic manager.
