A police spokesman added: "We would encourage drivers to secure items using appropriate fixings and products, as it's quite clearly dangerous and drivers could face possible prosecution."
The passenger was lying beneath the wardrobe doors because the rear car seats had been put in the flat position to get them in the vehicle, Sgt Harris explained.
