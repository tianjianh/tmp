[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inspector for education watchdog Ofsted has been jailed for two years for child grooming and making indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Adam Higgins, 48, of Maypole Close, Saffron Walden, was arrested by Essex Police in September last year after a tip off from the National Crime Agency.
At the time he was working as an inspector for Ofsted. He was suspended from his role and later resigned.
He admitted two counts of making indecent images of children.
Appearing at Chelmsford Crown Court, Higgins also pleaded guilty to one charge of inciting a boy aged 13 to 15 to engage in sexual activity.
Det Insp Daniel Stoten, from Essex Police, said:"This man held a position of trust which makes the fact that he was making indecent images of children and grooming a young boy online even more despicable."
Higgins was put on the sex offenders register indefinitely and was made the subject of a sexual harm prevention order.
HM Chief Inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw said: "As Ofsted's chief inspector, I share the sense of revulsion at the thought that an individual trusted with improving the education of young people has behaved in this way.
"While the police have confirmed that there is no reason to believe any pupils at the schools he inspected were at risk during his inspection visits, we have liaised closely with the schools and local authority areas in which Mr Higgins worked and will continue to do so over any concerns they may have.
"While this is a deeply shocking case and a matter of profound regret, we believe we did everything we could to check his background. It serves as a reminder of the need for continual vigilance when it comes to safeguarding children."
