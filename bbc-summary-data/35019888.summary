It has caused big problems for people living in parts of northern England and Scotland.

Around one month's worth of rainfall fell in just 24 hours.
There are more than 50 flood warnings in place across the UK and the Met Office has advised people not to travel.
Dozens of trains have been cancelled, and roads have been closed in Scotland, England and Wales.
