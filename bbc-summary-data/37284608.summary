After seeing out his Reading contract last season, the 27-year-old was a free agent until he moved to The Hawthorns on transfer deadline day.
"There was significant amounts of money being offered to me abroad, the likes of China, Asia, but that's not what I'm looking for," said Robson-Kanu.
"I'm looking to progress in my career."
Robson-Kanu's first appearance since joining the Baggies came as Wales beat Moldova 4-0 in their opening 2018 World Cup qualifier.
He came off the bench to replace goalscorer Sam Vokes in the 75th minute.
West Brom face Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday.
"I'll go in there, apply myself, work hard and hopefully get into the team," said Robson-Kanu.

"A lot of negotiations went on with a lot of clubs here and abroad throughout the course of the window.
"But it was an important decision for myself and my family and we had to make the right one and in the end I decided on West Brom.
"It's a fantastic club, stable in the Premier League - and I'm looking forward to playing there."
West Brom chairman John Williams has said Pulis is "very selective and particular about the players he recruits".
