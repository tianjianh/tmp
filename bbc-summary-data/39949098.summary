[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pig is to be named Bridget Jones's Baby after the novel won the Wodehouse Prize for comic fiction.

Author Helen Fielding has made the award's shortlist twice previously before finally winning the title.
The book was made into a film last year - with Renee Zellwegger returning to play the title role.
Fielding said she was "overjoyed" to win the pig (even though she won't get to keep it), which will be presented to her at the Hay Festival.
"It's the third time I've been nominated and I've been hoping for this moment for years," she said.
"I'm like one of those people who keeps nearly winning an Oscar and then having their hopes smashed to the ground."
Bridget Jones's Baby sees the character unexpectedly become pregnant - without being certain who the father is.
One of the judges, publisher David Campbell, said the panel "absolutely loved Helen Fielding's laugh-out-loud funny addition to the series".
The literary prize is given annually to the book considered to best capture the comic spirit of PG Wodehouse.
Previous winners have included Will Self, Alexander McCall Smith and Terry Pratchett.
As the winner, Fielding will also be awarded some champagne and a complete set of the PG Wodehouse collection of novels.
And in case you were wondering about the breed of the pig, it will be a Gloucestershire Old Spot.
