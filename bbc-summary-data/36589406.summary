The Scotland Under-21 international has yet to feature for the Premier League side's first team since a Â£1m move from Hamilton last summer.
Hendrie, 21, spent the second half of last season on loan at League One side Southend, making five appearances.
"He's not the finished article because he's a young kid, but he has scope for development," said manager Owen Coyle.
"I know West Ham have got high hopes for him to play in the Premier League in future years."
He told BBC Radio Lancashire: "I do expect to still announce another couple of signings this week - it's something I'm working very hard at."
