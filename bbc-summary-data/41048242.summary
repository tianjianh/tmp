Burke, 20, became the most expensive Scottish player ever when he joined Bundesliga side Leipzig for a fee of about £13m in August 2016.
He made 25 league appearances last term and helped Leipzig qualify for the 2017-18 Champions League group stage.
"I feel like it is a time for me to play more games," said Burke.
"I want to impress and I want my name to be first on the teamsheet."
Burke could make his West Brom debut on Sunday at home to Stoke (13:30 BST).
Baggies boss Tony Pulis described Burke as a player with "tremendous talent".
He is West Brom's fourth major signing of the summer.
Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez, 28, signed for about £12m in July, Egypt defender Ahmed Hegazi, 27, has joined on a season-long loan deal, while former England midfielder Gareth Barry, 36, joined for an undisclosed fee.
The Baggies have also signed China striker Yuning Zhang, 20, who has started a two-year loan in Germany with Werder Bremen.
West Brom have won their first two games of the Premier League season - both 1-0 against Bournemouth and Burnley.
