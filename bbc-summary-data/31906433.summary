A veritable who's who of snooker stars.
Mark Selby, the Jester from Leicester, is the defending champion. He came from 10-5 down to beat Ronnie 'The Rocket' O'Sullivan 18-14 in last year's final. He took home the holy grail of snooker titles and the £300,000 prize money. This year's competition looks to outdo the last with all the star names once again descending on south Yorkshire.
