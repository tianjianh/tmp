Unilever: Negotiations continue in NI price dispute

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Negotiations have been continuing to try to resolve a dispute between NI retailers and the multinational goods manufacturer Unilever.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
SuperValu, Mace and Centra stores are no longer getting products from the company after they raised prices by 10%.
A similar dispute between Unilever and Tesco was resolved on Thursday.
It is understood they are optimistic that the pricing dispute will be resolved.
Glyn Roberts from the NI Independent Retail Trade Association said he hopes for a resolution within 24 hours.
Mr Roberts said: "This is all about the consumer.
"It is about local shoppers, ensuring they don't have to pay more at the end of the week."
200 smaller stores in Northern Ireland are affected.
The Musgrave Group which owns the stores says it neither wanted to absorb the 10 % rise in cost or pass it on to customers.
It refused it and on that basis Unilever stopped supplying the NI retailers, as of Monday.
Musgrave said it was "hugely dissatisfied" with Unilever's behaviour and said it has caused immediate shortages of stock.
