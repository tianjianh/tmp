Cheryl Parker, 45, wondered why the bins where she lives in Prince Arthur Street, Barnsley, were all over the place and so checked her CCTV.
The video of the bin men's actions has been widely shared on social media.
Barnsley council said the behaviour was unacceptable and an investigation would be carried out.

"This behaviour is totally unacceptable and a full investigation will be carried out.
"We thank the resident for getting in touch and apologise for the level of service she received and any distress caused."
