Labour leader: Row after MP backs 'working mum' Cooper

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Helen Goodman's decision to back Yvette Cooper as the next Labour leader because she is a "working mum" has been criticised by a rival's campaign chief.

Toby Perkins, who is leading Liz Kendall's leadership campaign, said it suggested a "paucity of intellectual argument" on behalf of Ms Goodman.
Labour needed a serious debate about its future direction, he said.
Ms Cooper, Ms Kendall, Jeremy Corbyn and Andy Burnham are all vying to become Ed Miliband's successor.
The winner of the contest will be announced on 12 September, ahead of the party's autumn conference.
In an article for Huffington Post, Ms Goodman, shadow media minister and Bishop Auckland MP, set out why she would be supporting Yvette Cooper's candidacy.
She said that being a parent to two children was "much more important" than her political career.
"That's why I'm backing Yvette Cooper to be the next Leader of the Labour Party. As a working mum, she understands the pressures on modern family life," she wrote.
Ms Goodman added: "We need a leader who knows what challenges ordinary people face day to day, and who is committed to helping them."
Asked about her comments Mr Perkins told BBC2's Daily Politics programme he was "disappointed" by the article.
"The idea that you say 'because one of the candidates is a mother they are the one that you should back' suggests a paucity of intellectual argument that the Labour Party really should have moved beyond," he said.
Mr Perkins said Labour suffered its worst electoral performance since 1983 at the general election.
The idea that the party could "go back to the electorate with the same programme but get a different outcome is intellectually bankrupt".
