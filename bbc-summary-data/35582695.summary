Band-mates Tomas Lowe, Kris Leonard, River Reeves and Jack Dakin, died along with manager Craig Tarry on Saturday.
Mr Lowe's mother said the group were "living the dream" after playing their first gig outside the UK.
Viola Beach entered the official Top 40 for the first time on Monday, prompting a plea to get them to number one.
Relatives of the five men came together to pay tribute to them following the crash.
Ruth Lowe said her son Tomas was "a happy person" who was "always smiling".
The Warrington band were travelling in a car after their first gig outside the UK when the vehicle plunged more than 25m (80ft) into a canal near Stockholm.
Mrs Lowe said: "Tomas was an absolutely beautiful boy, mischievous, full of life - loved life - had lots and lots of friends, and a happy person - he was always smiling.
"They worked really hard, but they were all friends and lived for the music, lived life to the full."
She added that the four band members "had a great relationship" with their manager.
Diane Tarry said her 32-year-old son Craig wanted to make the band successful.
"He just loved the buzz. He was determined to get them to the top."
His father Colin Tarry said: "When Craig first asked me to listen to the band, [he] said 'look what do you think of these Dad?'"
"I said: 'get them signed up, get the music out there, because these lads are gonna be really big'."
"I just don't want them to die in vain. Let's get 'em to number one."
Viola Beach's single Swings & Waterslides has entered the Official Top 40 at number 39. It is expected to rise before the full chart is announced on Friday.
Ben Reeves, the father of 19-year-old guitarist River Reeves, said his son "was just focused on making music... and making people laugh."
An investigation is now under way into the accident in which police say the band's car fell through a gap in a bridge, which had opened to let a boat pass through.
