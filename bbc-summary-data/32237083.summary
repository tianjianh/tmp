UKIP's pledges
Today UKIP pledged to reduce the costs of childcare, affirmed its commitment to current maternity entitlements and promised to fund 3,000 more midwives.
MEP Patrick O'Flynn accepted the party needed to do more to improve its image with women.
He said: "Nigel [Farage] himself has said sometimes UKIP has resembled a rugby club on tour. We need to work harder and there still are occasions when men in the party who should know better have resorted to boorishness or chauvinism."
Unfortunately, earlier on, some of the set at a UKIP press conference had disintegrated.
George Osborne is "a very dangerous man with a very dangerous plan and I will do everything in my power to stop it", the Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg tells "arch interrogator" Alastair Campbell in an interview for men's magazine GQ .
Mr Clegg also tells the magazine that David Cameron is "very much a Tory, and in that tradition he is not too much about grand vision".
And he says: "Cameron would tell you himself, he is a classic traditional shire Tory, and I can live with that."
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon: "Ed Miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become Labour leader. Now he is willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister."
Labour leader Ed Miliband: "Michael Fallon is a decent man. But today I think he has demeaned himself and he has demeaned his office. National security is too important to play politics with."
Natalie Bennett, leader of the Greens: "We're opposed to the renewal of Trident, we want to get rid of Britain's nuclear weapons, that of course is the long-term Green Party position."
Justine Miliband, wife of the Labour leader: "Canvassing in the rain always reminds me of falling in love with Ed in 2005. I had never been out leafleting before and didn't realise you had to keep your eye out for dogs on the other side of the letterbox."
Guardian journalist Frances Perraudin on Twitter: "The Lib Dem battle bus just killed a pigeon. We are observing a minute silence."
What's the plan?
Labour's shadow cabinet and NEC has signed off on its manifesto after a meeting today.
Meanwhile, the Tories have delayed their manifesto launch by a day to avoid a clash with Labour's event on Monday. The Lib Dem manifesto will also be launched next week.
