Since the end of 2014 Malawi's police have recorded at least 65 attacks on people with albinism, including abductions, mutilations and murders, according to the UN.
People with albinism, who lack pigment in their skin and appear pale, are regularly killed in several African countries including Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.
Mr Mutharika told BBC Africa's Sophie Ikenye that the church had so far been silence on the issue.
