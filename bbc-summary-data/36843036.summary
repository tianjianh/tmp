The 33-year-old has made 78 appearances for the Baggies since joining from Hull City in 2010.
The former Wales international made 23 Premier League appearances last season after first-choice keeper Ben Foster was sidelined with a knee injury.
"Boaz is a great professional and he provides good competition for Ben," said West Brom head coach Tony Pulis.
