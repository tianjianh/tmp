Ventilation failure blamed for cancelled Borders operations

The failure of a "vital" ventilation system has been blamed for a rise in cancelled operations in the Borders.

Concerns over figures for August had been expressed by MSPs John Lamont and Jim Hume.
NHS Borders said that equipment failure had led to a "disappointing level" of cancellations.
It said that work was under way to ensure that performance improved in an area where issues were already highlighted earlier this year.
Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire Conservative MSP Mr Lamont said it was the fourth month in a row in which statistics for NHS Borders had been poor.
He said 63% of all cancelled operations were pulled by the hospital for "capacity or non-clinical reasons" while the national figure was just 17%.
He said: "These figures show hard working staff at NHS Borders continue to be let down by a lack of support from the Scottish government."
South of Scotland Lib Dem MSP Jim Hume highlighted figures which showed that 7.7% of all operations were cancelled in the Borders due to capacity or non-clinical reasons in August, around twice the level of the previous two months.
"Questions need to be asked of the health secretary as to why NHS Borders is continually being forced to cancel operations due to capacity or non-clinical reasons, and why there's now a doubling of cancellations since June," he said.
"Clearly the SNP government isn't putting enough support where it should be, resulting in staff shortages and added pressure on existing staff."
NHS Borders attributed the rise to the failure of its airflow system.
Evelyn Rodger, director of nursing, midwifery and acute services, said: "I recognise that a cancelled procedure is extremely frustrating for a patient and their family.
"The safety and clinical needs of our patients will always be considered first.
"The failure of the laminar air flow system has had quite an impact on our theatre cancellations this month."
She said immediate action was taken to fix the problem but it did mean that one of the theatres was out of action for four days.
"August also saw a high number of emergency admissions requiring surgery, which meant that in nine cases, the emergency procedures took clinical priority," she added.
"No one takes a decision to cancel a procedure lightly - it matters too much to our patients - and a dedicated piece of work is under way to improve our performance in this area."
A spokeswoman for the Scottish government confirmed that one operating theatre was unavailable for four days.
She added: "The decision for a board to postpone an elective procedure is never taken lightly and NHS Borders has been working to ensure disruption to patients is kept to an absolute minimum.
"Any postponed procedures will be rescheduled at the earliest opportunity.
"Under this Government, NHS Borders budget has increased by Â£41.4m.
"In 2015/16 NHS Borders' budget increased by 2.8% to a record Â£184.9m, an increase of 1.8% above inflation."
