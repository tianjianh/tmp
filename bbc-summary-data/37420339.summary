Film star Jamie Dornan is used to playing the bad guy but he is hoping to right some wrongs with his latest role.

The Holywood native has been cast as an Irish soldier who led his men through a siege during a UN peacekeeping mission.
The actor is best known for starring as the sadomasochist Christian Grey in the film version of the erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey.
Dornan also currently plays a sadistic, sexually motivated serial killer in the BBC TV drama, The Fall.
So was it difficult to move on from such characters to take on the role of a man Dornan considers to be a real-life Irish war hero?
"It's your job, I guess. That's what I'm paid to do" the actor said.
"You can never allow any character that you've played before to seep into a new project."
His new film, the Siege of Jadotville tells the true story of Irish UN troops who were attacked and taken prisoner in Congo in 1961.
"I actually just couldn't believe the story, I couldn't believe that I didn't know it, coming from this island," Dornan said.
He plays Comdt Pat Quinlan, who was leading a company of about 150 inexperienced Irish troops when they came under attack from thousands of tribesmen and mercenaries.
Against overwhelming odds, the Irishmen held out for six days, before surrendering and being taken as prisoners of war.
"To have a chance to play the man who led them through it - such an inspirational figure in Irish history should be more known," Dornan said.
About 40 of the Irish troops involved in the battle are still alive today, and have campaigned for the role they played to be recognised by the state.
"Rightly so, they've had such a bad rap," Dornan said.
"There's a whole derogatory term 'Jadotville Jacks' that was pinned on them all.
"Any sort of acts of cowardice in the military going forward - they were known as Jadotville Jacks, which is a total disgrace to be honest.
"So hopefully, we're showing them in the right light."
The film's director, Richie Smyth, agreed, saying: "Basically, within the army itself, which is a closed community, they were made to feel ashamed."
The film is due to be released in cinemas next month.
In a bid to channel the soldiers' spirit, the cast were sent to "boot camp" in South Africa before filming began.
"The most valuable part of that was just bonding with the lads," Dornan said, speaking of his fellow actors.
He added the training was also useful for "safety reasons".
"You've got to know how to handle a gun."
The film's director said that even in the boot camp, he put Dornan in charge of the other actors, so he could "create the dynamic" of leading men.
Dornan is soon to return to the small screen in the third and final series of The Fall.
However, there is no need for a spoiler alert as he is giving nothing away.
"I can't say anything, you'll just have to watch it.
"There's a lot of big twists this series," he added
"There are big things that happen that I just couldn't touch upon without ruining it.
"I've been trying to work out ways of leaking stuff but I actually don't know how to say it without wrecking the story."
