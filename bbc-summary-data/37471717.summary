Former Bath head coach Mike Ford has been appointed backs coach at French side Toulon.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 50-year-old left the Recreation Ground at the end of last season after a disappointing ninth-place finish in the Premiership.
Ford, who has also served on the coaching staff for England, will work alongside head coach Diego Dominguez at the three-time European champions.
"Toulon is the greatest club in Europe, it is an honour for me," said Ford.
