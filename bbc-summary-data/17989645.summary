An £850m project to replace an Edinburgh shopping centre described as an "eyesore" has been delayed by three years.

The work on the St James Quarter, at the east end of Princes Street, was originally due to be completed by 2015.
Developers Henderson Global Investors said the completion date was now 2018.
The plan, to demolish the existing 1970s St James Centre and replace it with modern retail and office space, was given the go-ahead in 2009.
At the time, Henderson Global Investors said the scheme would restore the city's reputation as a world-class shopping destination.
Under the plans, the St James Quarter would contain twice as much retail space as the existing centre and could house up to 90 shops.
An Edinburgh City Council spokesperson said: "Henderson Global remain committed to the redevelopment of the St James Centre and will be taking this project forward over the next five years.
"The company has a strong track record in delivering shopping centre developments throughout the UK, including the Bullring in Birmingham and the Buchanan Galleries in Glasgow."
