Negotiations over who takes control of the council have been in progress since the election.
The Conservatives, as the largest party, had the first chance to try to form either a minority administration or a coalition but their proposal was unanimously rejected by the independent members.
Mr Paynter, former deputy leader, said his party would "seek to put people first" and "ensure that we deliver on the Cornwall Devolution Deal".
He added: "We will pledge to invest in excess of Â£200 million in building 1,000 council houses for fair rent. We will also extend the living wage foundations living wage, to all council contracts."
The council has been led by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and independents since 2013.
