[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Duty-free alcohol has been banned on all Ryanair flights from the UK to Ibiza to improve the "comfort and safety" of passengers and crew.

The airline confirmed any alcohol purchased after security checks would now have to be placed in hold luggage or disposed of at the departure gate.
Previously it had banned alcohol on flights to Ibiza from Scotland.
The airline sent emails detailing the ban to passengers, saying bags would now be searched at departure gates.
The airline said: "Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed carefully in a suitable item of cabin baggage, which will be tagged at the gate and then placed in the aircraft hold free of charge.
"If the alcohol is unsuitable for placing in the hold (eg a plastic bag) then customers will be required to dispose of the alcohol in the bins provided."
It added: "Boarding gates will be carefully monitored and customers showing any signs of anti-social behaviour or attempting to conceal alcohol will be denied travel without refund or compensation."
Ryanair operated flights to Ibiza from Bristol, East Midlands, Stansted, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow Prestwick, Manchester and Leeds Bradford airports.
It said the safety of passengers is a "number one priority".
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it backed attempts to deal with drink-related problems on flights.
"It is actually a specific criminal offence to be drunk on board an aircraft, and also to refuse to comply with instructions from the captain," a CAA statement said.
"We support UK airlines' efforts to deal with disruptive passengers to ensure the safety of all those on board, and welcome criminal prosecutions where appropriate."
