Cambridge University explorers: Naked natives and frozen sausages

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Naked natives and freeze-dried sausages feature in an exhibition chronicling a Cambridge college's "enduring fascination" with exploration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Photographs and maps, some of which have never gone on public display, have been found in the St John's College archive.
A number of the images on display were taken during a 1963 expedition to East Greenland involving members of the college.
The group, who practiced by scaling the college chapel's tower in the flatlands of Cambridge, went on to conquer 28 peaks which had never been climbed before.
However, it took them eight days to reach base camp, by which time they had already run out of provisions.
But luckily for the team - put together by St John's student John Lendon - they had pre-arranged for packs of freeze-dried sausages and chocolate to be dropped by plane.
Organisers of the exhibition say the college has an "enduring fascination with exploration... which seems to have begun in the 1600s".
One of the earliest items on display is an atlas dating from 1682 which depicts naked "natives" at the South Pole.
It was presented to John's by the late 17th Century master, Sir Humphrey Gower.
At the time the South Pole was unknown territory. The map-maker clearly had no idea it was a frozen wasteland and "amusingly depicted 'natives'... absolutely starkers", the college said.
Also on show are previously-unseen extracts from the diary of former college master Sir James Wordie, who was chief scientific officer on Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated Antarctic expedition of 1914-17 where they were forced to abandon their ship, Endurance.
