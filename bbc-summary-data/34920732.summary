Two men have been arrested in Rhondda Cynon Taff as part of a crackdown on illegal dog hunting, South Wales Police has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 21-year-old, of Tonyrefail, and a 35-year-old, from Tonypandy, were arrested in connection with alleged animal cruelty offences after three properties were raided.
It was part of a nationwide-day of targeting those using dogs to "hunt wild and domestic animals".
Nine injured dogs were seized in Wales.
The operation was carried out in collaboration with RSPCA inspectors.
Det Con Chris Jackson said: "The illegal use of dogs for hunting and the cruelty inflicted on both the prey and the dogs themselves is something which will not be tolerated and the police and our partners in the RSPCA will do all we can to stop this kind of appalling behaviour."
