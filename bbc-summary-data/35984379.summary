The 3,100 metre runway will be built 1.6 km north of the existing main runway. It is expected to be operational in 2020.
The airport received planning permission in 2007 to build a new runway.
However, that was put on hold due to the economic downturn and a fall in passenger numbers.
The latest announcement had been expected after passenger numbers hit a record 25m last year, beating the previous record of 23m set in 2008.
There are expectations that the airport may increase passenger charges to help pay for the new runway.
The airport's chief executive, Kevin Toland, said that the expansion would be good for business and tourism.
"Dublin Airport's north runway will significantly improve Ireland's connectivity supporting trade, foreign direct investment and tourism," he said.
"We are very conscious of balancing the national and business needs with those of our local communities and we will continue to work closely with our neighbours in relation to this project."
The republic's minister for transport, tourism and sport, Paschal Donohoe, said the new runway would bolster Ireland's economic recovery.
"This project is of major strategic importance to Ireland as an island economy, in terms of improved connectivity. It has the potential to create thousands of jobs, both directly and indirectly, over the coming years," he said.
