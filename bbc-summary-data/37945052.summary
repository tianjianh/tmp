Funding cuts force Cancercareline charity to close

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Caerphilly county cancer charity will close at the end of the year due to funding cuts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cancercareline, based in Blackwood, has provided 24-hour support services for patients and their families for over 30 years.
Its annual running costs of Â£72,000 have been met by Caerphilly council and Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.
But its funding has been reduced by tens of thousands of pounds.
The charity said it had been in negotiations with both the council and health board and has been offered Â£20,000 for this year and Â£16,000 for 2017-18.
In its notice of closure it said: "Faced with this situation the trustees have no alternative but to take the decision to wind up the charity.
"A decision to enter into an inadequately funded contract would have been improper."
It added: "This is a very sad time for everyone."
Cancercareline will close on 31 December, with any leftover funds donated to a like minded charity.
