[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Catalin Horhota, 42, of no fixed abode, was found unanimously guilty of nine counts including rape and sexual assault.
The Oxford Crown Court jury heard he raped one woman inside a property and returned an hour later to again sexually assault her, having stolen a pair of keys.
Horhota will be sentenced by Judge Peter Ross on 9 October.
He was found guilty on Tuesday of one count of burglary, two counts of attempted rape, three counts of sexual assault, one count of assault by penetration, one count of rape and one count of exposure.
Horhota burgled a property in Morrell Avenue, opposite South Park in Oxford, on 17 September last year and stole food.
Two days later he raped a woman at a nearby address in Headington. About an hour later he returned and sexually assaulted the victim again.
He then sexually assaulted another woman at the same address.
On 20 September Horhota sexually assaulted a woman in South Park by touching her inappropriately.
The final offence took place on 22 September when Horhota exposed himself in Abingdon.
Following Horhota's conviction, Det Con David Rogers said: "I would like to thank the victims for coming forward and reporting these serious offences to Thames Valley Police.
"Although horrific, I would like to reassure members of the public the offences carried out by Horhota are rare."
