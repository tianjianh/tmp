About 40 dancers had used the Trinity Centre in Llandudno, Conwy county, for eight years but they have now had their contract terminated.
The centre said they had failed to comply with a request to stop using accelerants, like wax, on the floor.
Ted Harding, 77, and his wife Doris, 76, said they were "extremely upset".
Accelerants are sometimes used on surfaces to help dancers glide.
But dancer Mr Harding, from Colwyn Bay, denied treating the floor.
He told told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme: "The problem appears to be a case of misunderstanding.
"We don't use any accelerators. They've just issued me with a carte blanche termination of my contract.
"It is deeply upsetting."
Mrs Harding said she was "bearing up under the strain".
She added: "It's affected both of us very badly."
In a written statement, the centre's committee chairman, Linda Groom, said: "We have very elderly and vulnerable people using the centre.
"Despite requests not to use accelerants on the floor this is not being complied with."
Mr Harding has been offered the use of Ty Hapus Community Centre in the town but said it was "unsuitable".
He said:  "It is far too large. It's the size of a football pitch."
The couple are now looking for a new venue.
