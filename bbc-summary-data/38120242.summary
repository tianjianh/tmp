Having beaten hosts Scotland in the semi-finals, Victoria Moiseeva's Russians edged Anna Hasselborg Swedes 6-4 by scoring two at the final end.
Russia are the first nation to defend the women's title since Sweden in 2005.
The men's final was even more dramatic, with Niklas Edin's rink edging out Thomas Ulsrid's Norway with a single at the extra end for a 6-5 victory.
It is the first time any nation has retained the title on three consecutive years since Hammy McMillan's Scotland team between 1994 and 1996.
Peter de Cruz's Switzerland had beaten Russia on Friday to take the men's bronze at Braehead Arena in Renfrew.
And Eve Muirhead's Scots finished fourth in the women's competition by defeating Czech Republic.
While Muirhead's rink won all nine of their round robin games to qualify for the semi-finals, Moiseeva's Russians had lost three to qualify in equal third.
And skip Moiseeva, whose compatriot, Anna Sidorova, led their nation to victory in Denmark last year, could not quite believe her team had gone on to take gold.
"We don't quite understand how this has happened to us," she told the World Curling website.
"Of course, we were hoping for that and, now it's happened, it just feels great.
"It's so great to win the gold at our first European Championship. We qualified from fourth place and now we're here - it's great."
Sweden skip Hasselborg was just as surprised to have to settle for silver, having only lost one match in the round robin.
"I still can't believe that we actually lost," she said. "I had played the exact same shot earlier and we had the same ice - I have no idea how that last rock ran. I have no words.
"I'm proud of my team but sad about the silver medal."
Compatriot Edin was relieved to come out on top after what he predicted would be a close final.
"It feels great," he said. "Team Norway were playing better and better through the week and we kind of lost our touch in the semi-final.
"It was a really exciting final and I'm glad we got the best of it.
"It's hard to compare this with previous wins. All of them have been special in their own way, but winning three in a row, it's definitely up there. All three of them have been really sweet."
Ulsrud suggested that his Norway rink had done well against the best team in the world.
"We managed to stretch them to an extra end, but we just couldn't quite handle it there," he added.
