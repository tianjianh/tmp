Vandals have chopped down a pear tree planted by the Princess Royal to mark the centenary of Britain's worst rail disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened at Gretna Green some time overnight between Friday and Saturday.
The tree was planted on 22 May during events to mark the 100th anniversary of the nearby Quintinshill disaster in which more than 200 people died.
Police have appealed for any witnesses to the incident to contact them.
PC Andy Aitken said: "It beggars belief that someone has carried out such a wanton act of vandalism."
