This is because one extra second was added to the minute from 11:59pm to 12:00am on New Year's Eve, making the last minute of 2016 last for 61 seconds.
This is called a leap second, and we've done this since 1972, so that the time on our watches matches how the Earth is rotating.

But what might you do with the extra time? A lot can happen in a second!
Lightning could strike 6 times, the ISS can travel 7,700m around the Earth and a bee can beat its wings 270 times.
