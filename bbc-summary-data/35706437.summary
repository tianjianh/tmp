The singer, actress and former X Factor judge has been cast as Penny, the dance partner of lead character Jonny Castle, the Hollywood Reporter said.
Dancer and actor Colt Prattes is to play Jonny, with Oscar-nominee Abigail Breslin playing opposite him as Baby Houseman in the show by US network ABC.
Scherzinger tweeted she was "so excited" to join the cast.
The three-hour remake, which will be directed by The Sapphires director Wayne Blair, has yet to get a transmission date.
Set in the summer of 1963, Dirty Dancing is the song-and-dance love story about 17-year-old Baby, originally played by Jennifer Grey, who falls for her working-class dance instructor, Johnny Castle - played by Patrick Swayze.
The role of Penny was played by Cynthia Rhodes in the 1987 film.
Eleanor Bergstein, who wrote the screenplay for the original movie and was also behind the successful Dirty Dancing musical, is on board for the small screen adaptation to be produced by Lionsgate TV.
Previously in 2011, Lionsgate announced plans to remake the film for the big screen, with Kenny Ortega - who choreographed the original and directed High School Musical - at the helm.
