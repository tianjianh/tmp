Bill Knight commissioned artists to paint the wall of his home in Northload Street, Glastonbury, to deter taggers.
He was told in June to remove it after a planning inspector ruled its "scale, colours and style" was "harmful" to the area's heritage.
But Mendip District Council has agreed it can stay after more then 3,500 people signed a petition.
The work features some of the myths and legends the Somerset town is famous for.
It was commissioned after Mr Knight got fed up with vandals painting graffiti on the side of his house.
Councillor Tom Killen said a number of factors had been considered including the "significant drop in the levels of graffiti" on the wall after the mural was painted.
"The petition was one of the largest the council had ever received," he said.
"The location is a gateway site to Glastonbury town centre and the mural had been, and continues to be, appreciated by locals and tourists alike."
The mural will be allowed to stay on the listed building for two years, after which time the situation will be reviewed.
Mr Knight has been contacted for comment.
