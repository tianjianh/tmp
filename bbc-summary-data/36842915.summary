Charlotte Hart, 19, and mother Claire, 50, were killed by father Lance, 57, near the Castle Sports Complex in Spalding, Lincolnshire, on Tuesday.
He then took his own life with the shotgun he used in the killings.
In a statement, police said the "provenance of the weapon used is an active line of enquiry".
Officers also said they could "confirm that the deceased was not a shotgun certificate or firearms licence holder".
Tributes have been paid to Charlotte by her former school.
Spalding High School said the community was "deeply shocked and saddened" to hear of Charlotte's "tragic death".
In a statement on its website, the school said: "Charlotte had many close friends and her polite and caring nature endeared her to all who met her.
"Charlotte was incredibly driven to achieve her dream of studying midwifery at university. Academically, Charlotte excelled and her final grades were a tribute to her hard work and dedication."
The teenager became a midwifery student at Northampton University after leaving Spalding High.
After the shootings police entered the family home in Hatt Close, Moulton, where tributes have been left outside.
One said: "Rest in peace Charlotte and Claire, kind and lovely people who will be missed deeply", while another read: "Claire and Charlotte, two beautiful lives taken too early. Sleep peacefully you lovely girls."

A neighbour, who only gave his name as Peter, said Mr Hart worked as a delivery driver for a builders' merchants.
"Last time I spoke to him, he had put the house on the market because they were hoping to downsize, buy somewhere in the village. He was a very nice guy, he went out of his way to be helpful so it comes as a great shock."
South Holland District Council told the BBC the shooting was believed to be a "domestic incident".
A post-mortem examination is due to take place later.
