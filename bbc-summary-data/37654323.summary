A woman who crowdfunded for treatment of a rare and aggressive form of ovarian cancer has celebrated her wedding day.

Emma Houlston, 31, from south-west London, is undergoing an experimental form of potentially lifesaving treatment not available on the NHS.
In lieu of presents, she and husband Matt Lees asked wedding guests to help contribute towards the Â£114,000 annual cost of her treatment.
They married in London on Saturday.
Other well wishers have helped swell the funds of her GoFundMe page to more than Â£234,000 so far.
In a blog post she said: "The costs we face for this treatment are terrifying but when the only other option is giving up and dying, I'm determined to find a way to keep myself alive."
Ms Houlston is an art director and following her previous treatment for hypercalcemic small cell ovarian cancer in 2014, she directed an advertising campaign for the charity MacMillan Cancer Support.
She said her condition essentially meant she had "too much calcium in her blood" meaning it had to be "washed out" at regular intervals. However, this comes with its own problems as the washing process strips her blood not only of calcium but almost everything else.
Ms Houlston, from Balham, said about 40 people attended the wedding at Chelsea's Old Town Hall registry office, while another 50 joined the wedding party for the reception in nearby pub The Orange.
"It was a lovely day but I'm very tired and was very tired yesterday," she said.
"It was quite a big day to slot into everything although we were very lucky with the rain."
The couple had originally planned a wedding in the countryside but Ms Houlston's illness meant they needed to get married as near to the Royal Marsden hospital as possible in case her condition deteriorated.
Her preparation the night before her wedding was also unusual.
She said:"The wedding yesterday was a struggle but the hospital did their very best and I had a few blood transfusions beforehand. I was doing that at 7 or 8 o'clock the night before: watching the bloods go in rather than finishing off the wedding decorations."
She added: "My honeymoon will be starting radiotherapy and immunotherapy.
"I spend pretty much every day in here, but I get to go home at night.
"The staff have been wonderful. They decorated my bay with bunting and all sorts, everyone has been so kind."
