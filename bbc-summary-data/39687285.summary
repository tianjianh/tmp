Striker Grant Holt says Hibernian would have "romped" to victory had their Scottish Cup semi-final against Aberdeen gone to extra time.

Championship winners Hibs came from two down to 2-2 before Jonny Hayes' deflected effort won it for the Dons.
The Easter Road men had one more chance through Jason Cummings and Holt reckons that could have changed everything.
"If Jason gets in on goal at 3-2 and finishes his chance I think we would have gone on and romped it," he said.
"We were in the ascendancy and we were moving. But that's football, you have got to take your chances."
The Dons were ahead through goals from Adam Rooney and Ryan Christie when Holt was sent on in place of Fraser Fyvie by boss Neil Lennon.
The Englishman scored with a fine header two minutes later and set up Dylan McGeouch's equaliser on the hour.
But Hayes' strike eventually decided the game, ending Hibs' defence of the trophy.
"I haven't scored enough goals this season, and it was a great ball in," 36-year-old Holt added.
"We knew we had to change stuff and straight away we got on the front foot. To get the goal was good, and we could have done with the referee to give us 10 more seconds just before half-time since we had a four-on-two. But that's football, we won't cry about it.
"The two goals were scrappy in the first half and we changed our formation. Unfortunately, Fyvie got taken off just to do that, it was nothing he was doing.
"Aberdeen are a good side, they move the ball well, they have had a good season, they are flying high, and we made them change formation four times. That shows how well we did in the second half.
"We thought we defended well and didn't really give them much second half and it's a bitter blow. If he (Hayes) had whipped one in the stanchion then great, but unfortunately it was a deflection that rolled in the corner."
