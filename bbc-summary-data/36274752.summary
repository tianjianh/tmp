Vine appealed for a "Leicester dad and daughter" to join him and his 12-year-old daughter Martha ahead of the Foxes' last game of the season at Chelsea.
The BBC radio host, a Chelsea fan, said he wanted to chat about the title win.
Colin and Charlotte Hood said they were hoping for "nowhere too grand" as they wanted to wear their Leicester shirts.
The BBC Radio 2 presenter declared his "love" for Claudio Ranieri's side in February after realising Chelsea could no longer win the league.
He made the lunch offer in a post on Facebook when Leicester won the league following Chelsea's 2-2 draw with Tottenham.
Mr Hood, who describes himself as a "die hard" Foxes fan, said: "My wife was on Facebook and she called me over and said 'a couple of friends have liked this post from Jeremy Vine.'
"So I said 'just reply to him because I'm going to the game with Charlotte, and say we'd love to meet him.'"
He found out he and Charlotte had been chosen three days later.
He said: "I think she (Charlotte) thinks it (the lunch offer) comes with the territory.
"Now you see a lot of youngsters in their Leicester City shirts rather than Man Utd, Liverpool and Chelsea ones.
"She thinks Leicester's always been like this."
Vine, speaking to the two Leicester City fans on BBC Radio Leicester, said: "I hope you get a great welcome west London - I think most of the Chelsea fans will be supporting you in Europe."
He added he wanted to hear from Colin and Charlotte about "how this whole thing happened", adding: "I want my daughter to know that it's not all about the money."
