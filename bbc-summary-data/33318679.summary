The altercation involved a player from each side and happened at Basildon and Pitsea's ground during its fixture with Stanford-le-Hope on Saturday.
A Grays man in his 60s was taken to hospital and a man in his 40s arrested after what the Shepherd Neame Essex League called "a serious incident".
Essex Police said the arrested man was later released without charge.
Andrew Kennedy, chairman of the Shepherd Neame Essex League, said the two clubs would be carrying out their own investigations.
The man taken to hospital suffered a cut to his head. His injuries, Essex Police said, were not serious.
