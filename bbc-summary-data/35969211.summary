The Care Quality Commission (CQC) rated the department as good after an inspection in December. Last July and in December 2014 it was rated inadequate.
North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said it showed changes made since the last inspection were working.
In its report, the CQC said further improvements were needed.
It said the trust needed to reduce A&E delays, free up more beds and store patient records more securely.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, said: "A year ago I was seriously concerned at the safety of the urgent and emergency services.
"We warned North Bristol NHS Trust that it must take action to deal with demand in the emergency department, where patients were waiting too long to be assessed and treated.
"I am encouraged by the findings of this inspection.
"There is still work to be done to improve how patients move through the hospital but the trust can be proud of the improvements it has managed to date."
The trust's chief executive, Andrea Young, said: "Overall we are very pleased with the report as it accurately reflects our ongoing journey since the move into the new hospital.
"We are not complacent and are determined to make further improvements which we hope will be reflected in future CQC reports."
The Â£430m hospital was opened in May 2014.
