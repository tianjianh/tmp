Rangers have announced Andy Little, Peter Lovenkrands and Stephen Wright will return to Rangers as coaches under head of academy coaching Graeme Murty.

Murty, who had a spell as interim first-team manager this season, will combine his new role with being head development squad coach.
Lovenkrands played at Ibrox from 2000-06 while Wright had a spell there in the 1990s.
Little came through Rangers' ranks and was most recently at Stirling Albion.
Northern Ireland cap Little, 27, suffered a fractured skull and eye socket in a training-ground accident in April and, like Lovenkrands, will take on a part-time role.
Thirty-year-old Brian Gilmour, a former Rangers youth player who has been with Ayr United in recent years, also takes on a part-time coaching role with Rangers. Wright, 45, has previously coached with Rangers.
"We are changing the structure slightly," former Scotland player Murty, 42, told Rangers' website. "What we want to achieve and what we have always tried to strive for is having the best coaching programme in the country, working with the best players and run by the best coaches in the country, and I am really excited that I am going to be a part of that, to mould it and to hopefully move it forward.
"It's my job to put a development plan in place for each coach to make sure they are getting what they need in terms of support, to help them evolve and to help them grow and become a stronger coaching core."
