It was a first defeat in 11 Wimbledon semi-final appearances for the seven-time champion.
Afterwards, the 34-year-old saluted all corners of Centre Court, prompting speculation that he might be bidding farewell for good.
"To be very clear for you, I hope to be back on Centre Court," said the 17-time Grand Slam champion.
"It was a thank you for the crowd. That's what I was going through, not thinking that this might be my last Wimbledon."

Raonic, the first Canadian man to reach a Grand Slam singles final, will face Britain's Andy Murray in Sunday's final.
Federer's semi-final defeat followed a marathon five-set win over Marin Cilic in the previous round, in which he came back from two sets down and saved three match points.
The Swiss world number three is enduring the toughest year of his career. He missed the French Open because of injury, bringing an end to a streak of 65 successive appearances at Grand Slam events stretching back to 1999.
He has also failed to add to his 88 tour titles this year, suffering his longest drought since 2000, and arrived at Wimbledon having suffered back-to-back semi-final losses in Stuttgart and Halle.
Federer, who had surgery earlier this year on the same knee he hurt on Friday, will be 35 next month.
He has not beaten world number one Novak Djokovic at a Grand Slam since the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2012, when he went on to win his last major title.
"It's a dream to win my eighth title here but it's not the only reason why I play tennis," said Federer, who will represent Switzerland at the Olympics next month, injury permitting.
"I know Wimbledon is important, but it's not everything. I have played 10 sets [against Cilic and Raonic]. It's very encouraging for the season. I was insecure coming into Wimbledon."
