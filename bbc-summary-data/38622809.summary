The body of a 27-year-old man from Poland was found at Morton Hall Immigration Removal Centre, near Lincoln, on Wednesday.
The Prison Service-run site is for men subject to deportation who need secure conditions.
An independent investigation is being carried out by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.
The Unity Centre charity said detainees at the centre were "very low" and people were "sick and tired of the place".
It described the man who died as "young and caring" and said he had "spent his time watching TV, playing games and at the gym".
Morton Hall, which is run by the Prison Service on behalf of UK Border Agency, has 392 rooms spread across six residential units.
The centre is used to detain some asylum seekers who are awaiting decisions and also people whose asylum claims have failed and are awaiting deportation.
A Home Office spokesman said: "Our thoughts are with the individual's family at this very sad time.
"As is the case with any death in detention, the police have been informed and a full independent investigation will be conducted by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman."
