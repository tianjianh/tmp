[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bodies of Leszek Dantes and his wife Malgorzata, both 54, were found at their house in Hardwick Road East, Worksop, Nottinghamshire in April 2014.
Kamil Dantes, 29, had been charged with murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, which was accepted by the prosecution.
At Nottingham Crown Court, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said he would adjourn sentencing to a later date.
Police said Dantes had suffered a history of mental illness but his parents "could not have seen this coming".
After the hearing on Wednesday, Det Ch Insp Leigh Sanders, who led the investigation, said: "Kamil subjected his parents to a frenzied, prolonged attack on that April morning without any provocation.
"Caught unaware, they had no time to fight back and certainly his father, who struggled to walk, had no means of escape."
