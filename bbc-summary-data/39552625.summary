The puppy ice cream is safe for humans but is especially designed for pets, according to shop owner Mauricio Montoya.
It is made of natural yogurt and lactobacilli bacteria, which helps dogs to digest their food. Normal ice cream can cause pain and diarrhoea in dogs.
The ice cream is called a "heladog" - a combination of the Spanish word for ice cream 'helado' and the English word 'dog'.
