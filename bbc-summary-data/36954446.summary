The 25-year-old made 14 appearances for the Canaries last season, 11 of which were in the Premier League.
"We are delighted our patience has been rewarded," Addicks boss Russell Slade told the club website.
He is a very efficient, all-round goalkeeper, his kicking his good, he manages his box well and he is a very good shot stopper."
Charlton were without a senior goalkeeper following the departures of Stephen Henderson, Nick Pope and Marko Dmitrovic this summer.
Rudd, who has previously spent time on loan at Preston North End, becomes Charlton's sixth signing of the transfer window.
