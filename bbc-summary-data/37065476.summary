Australian world number 90 Fraser, who led by three overnight, had bogeys at the 12th and 15th in a two-under 69.
Sweden's Open champion Henrik Stenson moved to two shots off the lead at the halfway stage with a three-under 68.
Britain's Justin Rose lies two shots further back on six under, tied for fourth with Frenchman Gregory Bourdy.
Rose, 36, who had a hole-in-one in his first round, had three birdies in a two-under 69 to remain in medal contention.
"I had the hole-in-one obviously yesterday, which was a big stroke of luck, but I feel like there hasn't been any distance putts made yet or anything like that," said Rose.
"So I feel like just keep doing what I'm doing and wait for a string of birdies."
World number 64 Pieters, who has two European Tour titles to his name, carded the joint-second best round of the day, hitting seven birdies in a five-under 66.
