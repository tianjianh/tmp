Customers vent anger on social media after poor shop service

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Once upon a time, if you were unhappy with the service you received at a shop, you would speak to the manager or write a letter of complaint - or walk away muttering angrily under your breath.

Now customers are using social media to share their unsatisfactory shopping experiences, and their frustrations are being heard, and shared.
Shauna Adamson turned to Facebook after having her make-up applied at a Debenhams store in South Dublin for her friend's birthday.
But she was far from "made up" following her experience at the Urban Decay counter, and posted pictures of the result.
"Yes I did walk out of the store looking like this," she wrote. "I knew the make-up wasn't the best but didn't quite realise how bad it was until I got home."
The Facebook post, which features a number of different photos, has had more than 1,300 shares since Saturday, 24 July.
She received dozens of supportive comments but some questioned whether she had actually given herself the bad makeover.
In Shauna's most recent post, she defends herself against the accusations: "People are hurling abuse at me about the make-up saying I done it myself.
"If you'd check the facts Urban Decay have apologised saying that it was confirmed that the make-up was done by a trainee in one of their stores then you'll know I'm not a liar."
In a statement, a spokeswoman at Urban Decay said: 'We were truly sorry to hear that Shauna hadn't experienced the usual standard of the artistry we pride ourselves on.
"We've been in touch with her directly to offer a complimentary make-up service with another one of our make-up artists and a full refund."
In a separate incident, Harriet Rae turned to Facebook to shame two girls working at a Superdrug store in Truro, Cornwall, who, she claimed, made fun of her as she shopped.
Her response to what happened has gone viral.
In her post, Harriet asks the shop assistants to consider their actions: "Can you be a little bit kinder with your words? Some peoples skin isn't as thick as mine has become and the next persons might be very thin indeed."
And she adds a compliment too: "If you did your own hair and make up for work today, you are both very talented. I could never get my winged liner or my ponytail that perfect!"
Harriet has since posted: "I have spoken to the lovely people at Superdrug head office who apologised for what happened in the Truro Store on Saturday.
"I reinforced that the intended message of the post was to spread kindness and positivity not embarrassment or hurt.
"They understood and accepted that I didn't want to give a description of the people or my location in the store when it happened. They have also said that my post will be used in training in the future to make sure it doesn't happen again.
"Thank you to everyone who shared the post, sent friend requests and private messages.
"I never imagined it would gain so much publicity and it has definitely shown me how powerful social media can be."
A spokeswoman for Superdrug said: "Following the post on Facebook we launched an immediate investigation.
"At Superdrug we pride ourselves on the highest levels of customer service and would like to apologise unreservedly if on this occasion we have failed to meet our high standards.
We are in touch with Harriet and have apologised."
