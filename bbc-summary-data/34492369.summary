England v Estonia: How the players rated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England continued their run of being the only side with a 100% record in qualifying for Euro 2016 with victory over Estonia.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Everton midfielder Ross Barkley impressed in the middle of the park for the hosts, striker Harry Kane failed to score, while defender Gary Cahill captained England for the first time.
So how did England's players fare overall? Chief football writer Phil McNulty runs the rule over those on duty.
Barely in action. Has had plenty of quiet matches in this Euro 2016 campaign - might have been a night for Jack Butland to get a taste of the action.
Had plenty of time to get forward and deliver some crosses but actually had a fairly quiet game. Barely needed defensively.
Useful outing for the Southampton defender but very much down the pecking order of England left-backs. Competent.
Not much to do but elegant on the ball and one excellent clearance that could easily have been an own goal with poor technique.
Solid in defence but once again a night where he was never fully tested by an average Estonia side.
Tireless as ever but restricted by his role as a holding midfield player. Hodgson's Mr Reliable.
A dazzling, unpredictable talent. Still has flaws in decision-making but a real England game-changer and superb pass for Theo Walcott's goal.
Busy without making a serious impact on the game. Did not do enough to suggest he will be a starter when it matters.
Good night for the Arsenal striker as he got on the scoresheet. An increasingly reliable performer and offers England pace and adaptability.
Quiet night for the Spurs striker but has proved before he can get goals for England.
Good performance. Busy and showed real pace. Good for his confidence to get on the scoresheet with a simple late finish.
Very quiet cameo.
No rating but on long enough to set Sterling's goal up with a very unselfish pass.
A pointless substitution on Alli's debut.
