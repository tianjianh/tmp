[SN]TITLE[SN]
Presbyterian Mutual Society makes £14m profit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Presbyterian Mutual Society (PMS) made a profit of almost £14m in the year to March, mainly due to a rise in the value of its properties.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The PMS had to be bailed out by the government in 2010 after savers rushed to withdraw money.
It is now being managed by administrators so that the bailout money can be repaid.
The value of its investment properties was "written back" by £12m during the year and now stands at £72m.
The Department of Enterprise (DETI) bailed the society out with £225m of loans.
Annual instalments are due to repay £175m over 10 years, with the £50m balance being paid when the society is wound up.
The society could only make half of its scheduled loan repayments in the last two years
This does not alter the requirement on the society for the full repayment of the loan.
The PMS is largely repaying the loans from the rental income earned on its investment properties.
Meanwhile, it has emerged that the society is suing valuers and planning consultants over a £1.2m loan it made in 2007.
It has lodged a claim for negligence and breach of contract against J&E Shepherd Chartered Surveyors and WYG Engineering Ltd.
The claim relates to a loan made to a company controlled by the property developer Derek Harrison to buy a site in Scotland.
The PMS alleges there was an over valuation which did not take into account lack of access and planning issues in relation to the lands on which the loan was to be secured.
The two firms are defending the claim.
