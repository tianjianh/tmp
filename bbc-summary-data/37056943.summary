The giant helium balloon measures seven metres wide and was put together using satellite images of the moon.
Luke Jerram, the artist behind the balloon, said: "It's taken about six months to make and I'm hoping people will be inspired when they look at it and see all the craters and the details."
But shortly after Luke's comments, something went a little bit wrong... watch the video to find out what happened.
