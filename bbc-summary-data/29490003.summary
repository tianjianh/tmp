A World War Two sea mine has been found on a beach in Gwynedd.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Army bomb squad examined the device on Friday after it washed up on Benar beach at Dyffryn Ardudwy near Barmouth and an area was cordoned off.
A team returned to the site on Saturday to see if a controlled explosion was required, but the mine had already exploded and was not considered a hazard.
It will be removed by Gwynedd council workers on Monday.
