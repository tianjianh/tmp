Redwan El-Ghaidouni, 38, from west London, was approached by a man who fired a number of shots into his car before running off, police said.
The murder happened on Vine Lane, Uxbridge, on the evening of 3 February.
Officers have also confirmed the victim had served a prison sentence for importing drugs.
Investigating officer, Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, said: "We do believe this was a targeted attack and part of our inquiries are focussed on Mr El-Ghaidouni's past.
"He was linked to criminality and had recently served a sentence for drug importation. Did someone have a grievance against him related to drugs or other criminality?
"This was a brutal murder which was clearly well-planned and I'm sure there are several people out there who know why Mr El-Ghaidouni was killed."
After the shooting, the suspect ran through an alleyway leading to Saunders Road, before heading towards Dowding Road.
He was wearing a hooded top, bottoms, dark gloves and dark shoes or trainers.
"It seems unlikely the suspect was acting entirely alone - perhaps you saw more than one person hanging around the area," said Det Ch Insp McHugh.
Speaking on behalf of the family, Mr El-Ghaidouni's partner, Samantha Taitt, said: "I was expecting my beloved Redwan to return home from work to look after our three children.
"As he arrived home he was executed and he never stood a chance.
"Our three young children will now grow up without their loving father. His mother, father and siblings are left without a son and brother."
