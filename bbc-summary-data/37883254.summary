The players' union, the Professional Footballers' Association, is working with the EFL and the club to try and rectify the issue.
All Morecambe's staff were due to be paid eight days ago.
"We have been assured that it will be sorted next week, so it's fingers crossed that will happen," said PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor.
"Apparently there's been cash-flow problems. I spoke to the owner and spoke to the Football League, and at the moment, no, the lads have not had their wages on time.
"There's talk of maybe selling a player, we're awaiting a response from the Football League with the chief executive there, Shaun Harvey, and the league's lawyers to see if the matter can be resolved as soon as possible and we have been assured that will be will the case.
"If it's as we've been told by the owner, we're optimistic it should be resolved quickly."
I want to stress that this is a short-term problem and assure fans that we have robust plans in place for the future of our great club.
The Shrimps, who host Coventry City in the FA Cup first round on Sunday, were taken over by Brazilian businessman Diego Lemos in September.
He said in a statement: "I would like to apologise to all the players and staff who have not been paid on time.
"I deeply regret the problems this has caused but want to reassure everyone that the issues will be resolved soon and I want to thank the players and the staff for their understanding so far.
"We have faced a number of unexpected cash flow problems, but have put plans in place to make sure we get some funds in place next week and make sure everyone receives the money they are owed."
Morecambe are 12th in League Two, with six wins from their 15 games this season.
