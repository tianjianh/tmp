[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bruno Andrade scored for the fourth time in as many games for the hosts after 27 minutes, finishing past Jake Cole from an acute angle after a clever quick free-kick put him clean through.
The former QPR midfielder then saw his driven low free-kick diverted into the net by Shaun Jeffers five minutes before the interval to make it 2-0.
Cheye Alexander rifled past Grant Smith from 25 yards out to give Aldershot hope after 51 minutes, but Boreham Wood, who hit the bar through Andrade again late on, held on for their third win in five games.
