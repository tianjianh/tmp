[SN]TITLE[SN]
Irish government to host all-island forum on Brexit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Irish government is to hold an all-island forum next month to examine the implications of Brexit.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Taoiseach (prime minister) Enda Kenny said it was time to "intensify our engagement" after Theresa May indicated she would trigger the mechanism for leaving the EU next March.
The Irish government said the island's main political parties will be invited, as well as trade unions and NGOs.
But Northern Ireland's First Minister said there was "no need" for the forum.
Arlene Foster told an event at the Conservative Party conference that such a summit would lead to "grandstanding".
The Irish government first proposed an all-island forum in the wake of June's EU referendum result.
Sinn FÃ©in supported the idea, but the DUP have said that existing cross-border bodies could be used to work out the implications of Brexit on the island of Ireland.
In a statement, the Irish government said a "broad range of civic society groups, trade unions, business groups and non-governmental organisations", as well as political parties, would be invited to the first meeting of the "all-island civic dialogue" on 2 November.
The meeting will be hosted in Dublin by Mr Kenny and Irish Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan.
Speaking after the announcement on Tuesday, Mr Kenny said: "Ireland faces unique challenges from Brexit, not least given the all-island issues that arise."
The Irish government said the priority of the forum would be the Irish economy and trade with the UK; the peace process and Northern Ireland; and the Common Travel Area (CTA) between Ireland and the UK.
Even though the UK voted overall to leave the EU, a 56% majority in Northern Ireland wanted to remain.
The question of what will happen to the Irish border in the wake of Brexit has been the subject of much debate since the referendum.
Last week, the prime minister denied making a U-turn over the Irish border after she said she wants to maintain free movement.
Mrs May said in June, when she was home secretary, that it was "inconceivable" that there will not be any changes to border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
