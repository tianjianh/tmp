Reading Football Club has submitted plans to use land next to its stadium to build a homes and leisure complex.

Proposals for Royal Elm Park at the Madejski Stadium include 600 homes, a park and an ice rink.
It will also use 2,000 sq m for shops, leisure facilities and restaurants, and could create about 1,000 jobs.
The club said the land used includes parking space currently used on match days but that a new multi-storey parking lot would replace this.
The 600 homes will have a mix of one, two and three bedrooms and will "create a new community with Madejski Stadium at its heart".
A convention centre called The International with a capacity for 6,000 delegates is also planned to host live entertainment.
Reading FC chief executive Nigel Howe said the development would "benefit the football club" and was "important for Reading's future growth".
He added the complex would improve fans' "match-day experience".
Part of the land to be built on is currently an overflow car park for spectators.
This will be replaced by a similar capacity multi-storey car park with spaces for 616 cars and about 300 bicycles.
There will also be improved transport links to the stadium.
It is not yet known when the council will consider the plans.
