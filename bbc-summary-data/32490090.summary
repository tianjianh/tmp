England spinner Moeen Ali expects his second summer of Test cricket to prove more difficult than his first.

Moeen, 27, took 19 wickets in five Tests against India in 2014 but was less impressive in last week's win over West Indies, despite figures of 4-98.
"India didn't show me enough respect in the way they batted against me," he said. "It's going to be tougher playing New Zealand and Australia."
England start five Tests against the Kiwis in May and Australia in July.
In less than a year since making his Test debut against Sri Lanka, Worcestershire's Moeen has become key to England's attack and was flown out to Grenada for the victory over West Indies in the second Test after recovering from a side strain.
The off-spinner says that decision by the selectors gave him confidence and, despite a slow start with first innings figures of 1-47 then took three tail-end wickets as England bowled the hosts out for 307 in their second innings.
"Even when I wasn't bowling so well in the first innings it gave me confidence the management backed me, liked the way I bowl and think I'm a threat to the batsmen," added Moeen, who averages 27.53 with the ball in his eight Tests.
After a century in his second Test outing, Moeen has not contributed more than 40 in any knock since and is seen as an option to bat at six, with Jos Butler and Ben Stokes also possibilities.
"Whatever the captain and coach want me to bat I'm more than happy," he said. "We see it as a strong batting line up. Hopefully when we all play games and click we can be dangerous."
England begin their final Test of their tour of West Indies on 1 May, leading 1-0 in the series.
