Europa League: Derry City v FC Midtjylland (Thu)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City manager Kenny Shiels says his players must show full commitment if they are to "repair some damaged morale" against Danes FC Midtjylland.

Derry were thumped 6-1 in the first leg of the first qualifying round tie between the sides last week.
"People talk about restoring pride but I am full of pride because, maybe barring two players, everybody put in a shift in Denmark," said Shiels.
"We need everybody working hard and showing they have full commitment."
"If we are going to get beaten we should be beaten by a team that is superior to us. All it takes is one or two players to be off and not commit themselves for us to be in trouble," added the Derry boss.
The League of Ireland side were outclassed by their opponents in the first leg but Shiels is not overly critical of his side's performance.
"We are looking to make it a more competitive game to give us a boost going into Sunday's league match with Sligo and if the supporters can get behind us it will help us enormously.
"We didn't play badly in the first leg. We had periods of the game when we were very, very good and matched them but we just couldn't contain the mobility of their front four. They were so prolific and prominent in the last third of the pitch.
"Hopefully we can address that and see ways in which we can nullify it.
"They have physical prowess way beyond us in terms of stature and physique but we have to stand up to them and be professional."
The home side will be without injured duo Aaron Barry and Conor McDermott, while Dean Jarvis is a fitness concern.
Shiels will make a decision on Barry McNamee's potential involvement after taking medical advice and taking into account that the Candystripes have another game in three days' time.
