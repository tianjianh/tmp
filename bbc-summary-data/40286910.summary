There are scenes of devastation in the aftermath of the huge fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower in west London.
Rescuers say they do not expect to find anyone else alive inside the tower block in north Kensington following Wednesday's catastrophic blaze.
In the shadow of the gutted building a community reeling at the tragedy is pulling together to support survivors, as the death toll is expected to rise.
So far 17 people have been confirmed dead but dozens more are unaccounted for after the blaze trapped people inside the 24-storey block of flats in Latimer Road.
The families and friends of those missing have put up posters in the hope that they will be found alive.
Members of the public have gathered in the nearby area, bringing clothes as well as food and drink.
Messages of sorrow and solidarity are being left on a wall close to the scene of destruction.
