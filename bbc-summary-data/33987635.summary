Ricci Gallagher, 46, died in hospital a week after being injured at the farmhouse in Little Burstead, Essex.
It is owned by Richard Glanville, the ex-chief financial officer of a fashion firm that owned Oasis and Warehouse.
Mr Glanville and another man have been questioned on suspicion of attempted murder. Both have been bailed.
The victim's wife, Linda, said they had been excited about building their new home in the village, which they had moved into a week before.
"Ricci was a very kind, considerate person with a great zest for life and was liked by all who met him," she said.
"He was easy-going and good fun.
"Ricci and I had a very happy marriage and were excited about the new phase in our lives with the move to Little Burstead."
Mr Gallagher had reported a fire at his home about half a mile away in Blind Lane, minutes before police were called to the farmhouse on Sudburys Farm Road on 30 July.
Police said they were linking the incidents and were investigating why Mr Gallagher had been at the farmhouse.
It is understood one line of inquiry is Mr Glanville may have found Mr Gallagher inside the house.
"The tragic events that have unfolded from the day of the fire at our home... have left me and my family devastated," said Mrs Gallagher.
"I would ask for anyone who can help the police to do so... and finally ask that we now be left to come to terms with this terrible tragedy and grieve in private."
Officers are particularly keen to trace the drivers of a lorry and a Vauxhall car seen between 09:00 and 09:30 BST on 30 July.
