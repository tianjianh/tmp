[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kent PCC Ann Barnes to recruit youth commissioner

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A youth police and crime commissioner (PCC) is to be recruited in Kent to represent the views of young people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The announcement by Ann Barnes was one of her main manifesto pledges in the campaign leading up to her election as the county's first PCC last November.
She will use some of her Â£85,000 salary to pay the successful applicant, who will earn at least Â£15,000.
The youth commissioner will work closely with her team and be involved in driving youth-related projects.
Mrs Barnes, who will pay for a third of the role, said the aim of it was to "reach out to young people across the county".
She said: "Many young people feel alienated and disconnected from policing.
"For some, this leads to them being drawn into a life of crime and anti-social behaviour.
"This new post will help build on the excellent work already being done by partner agencies and the paid internship will offer lots of experience in media, policy, finance and the world of policing.
"I'm very excited about this and I will even consider those who have had a run-in with the law.
"A youth commissioner will play a big part as the voice of our young people - our next generation."
