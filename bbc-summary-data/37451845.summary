Anna Swabey, who given three months to live in 2015, died on 16 September. Her funeral took place earlier.
Miss Swabey, 25, from Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, died from brain cancer the day before she was due to marry her fiancé in the Yorkshire Dales.
When setting up the fundraising page, she said she wanted to "make a positive out of this negative situation".
More than 1,200 people made donations totalling almost £95,000, with an additional £5,000 from gift aid helping to reach the target.
Following her diagnosis, Miss Swabey described her treatment in a blog she called Inside my Head.
In her final post on 8 July, she said chemotherapy had left her feeling unwell but added her spirits had been lifted by her hen party in York.
