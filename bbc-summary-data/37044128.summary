Andrea Lewis, 51, was found dead at a property on Fairyland Road, Tonna, Neath, on 30 January with injuries to her skull and torso.
Rhys Hobbs, 46, of Tonna, was due to stand trial for murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter last month.
On Thursday, he was jailed at Swansea Crown Court for the "violent and protracted" attack.
The court heard Ms Lewis had been stamped on following a drunken row.
In the weeks running up to her death, she was covered in bruises and had a black eye - but told friends she had fallen.
After Hobbs attacked her in his home, Ms Lewis was dragged outside while half-dressed. She was found dead the next day.
Judge Keith Thomas said: "Andrea Lewis... became dominated by you. She felt unable to break ties with you and there is no doubt that you hit her regularly.
"Her friends and work colleagues saw injuries on her which she tried to disguise.
"The attack on her was violent and protracted... She was vulnerable and effectively defenceless."
After the hearing, Det Insp Rob Cronick said Ms Lewis had been "the victim of domestic abuse which ultimately led to her death".
