[SN]TITLE[SN]
Murder numbers at 38-year low but sex offences up 32%

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of murders and manslaughter cases in England and Wales has fallen to its lowest level for 38 years, police figures suggest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police recorded 515 homicides last year, 37 fewer than in 2013 and the smallest number since 1977.
The number of sexual offences recorded in 2014 rose by 32% to 80,262.
The Office for National Statistics said this was thought to be due to better recording and more "willingness of victims to come forward".
