The government operates the outlets with the widest reach: two radio stations, two TV stations and the leading daily newspaper.

The media have been key players during conflicts - including during the 2011 civil war.
Media outlets were used as propaganda tools during the five-month military standoff between rival claimants to the presidency.
Since the end of the conflict, the media have largely steered clear of using inflammatory rhetoric.
State and non-state actors frequently threaten media workers, including carrying out physical attacks and closing outlets.
Radio is the most popular medium. UN peacekeepers launched Onuci FM in 2005. There are no private terrestrial TV stations, although satellite pay TV is available.
BBC World Service broadcasts on FM in Abidjan (94.3), Yamoussoukro (97.7) and Bouake (93.9).
There were just over 5 million internet users by 2016 (via Internetlivestats.com). Facebook is the most popular social network.
