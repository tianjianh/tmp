Real Madrid: Spanish court dismisses Copa del Rey appeal

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Real Madrid remain excluded from the Copa del Rey after losing an appeal against their punishment for fielding an ineligible player.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-time winners were expelled for playing winger Denis Cheryshev against Cadiz in the last 32 on 2 December.
Cheryshev should have been serving a one-match ban for yellow cards he was shown while on loan at Villarreal.
Spain's Administrative Court of Sport dismissed Real's appeal after "analysing all the parties' arguments".
The club can still appeal against the verdict, but would need to take the case to Spain's normal law courts - effectively starting litigation against the Spanish football federation.
Real, third in La Liga behind Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, last won the Copa del Rey in 2014.
