The 44-year-old man was taken to hospital in stable condition on Friday morning. Another man is in police custody but has not been charged.
A spokesman for Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs told the BBC there was no indication the attack was "politically motivated".
The Russian Embassy in Canada has declined to comment on the incident.
Police and paramedics were called shortly before 09:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Friday to a residential building in a neighbourhood of Canada's capital with several embassies.
The victim, who paramedics believed was intoxicated, was in the lobby of the building when they arrived and initially refused treatment, the Ottawa Citizen reported.
He had been stabbed in the arm and the back and was transported to hospital for treatment.
