[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nissan nominated for Freedom of Sunderland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nissan will be granted the freedom of the city of Sunderland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The city council voted to award the honour to the car maker to recognise how it had "transformed both the city's and the region's economy".
The motion, which had cross party support, also praised the "sterling efforts" of its 7,000-strong workforce in securing the production of the next generation Qashqai and X-Trail.
A ceremony will take place in 2017 on a date yet to be decided.
Freedoms are proposed in Sunderland to individuals or groups who have made outstanding contributions to the wellbeing and community spirit of the city.
Leader of the Labour-run council Paul Watson, said: "For the first time we have the real secret of Nissan's success - it's the workforce."
Peter Wood, leader of the Conservative Opposition Group, seconded the motion.
He said: "It is right to recognise the contribution of the men and women who work at Nissan - on the production line, in the office and in the boardroom.
"To confer the freedom of the city upon them is the best way we as councillors can show how proud we are of them for the pride they take in their work."
Other freedoms of Sunderland include television reporter Kate Adie, FA Cup goalkeeper Jimmy Montgomery and the crew of HMS Ocean, the city's adopted Royal Navy warship.
