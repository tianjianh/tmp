The items will be sold at auction by the family of actress Jean Alexander, who died last year.
Many of Alexander's personal items, including a book given to her by Sir Laurence Olivier, will also be on sale.
Alexander's niece Sonia Hearld and her sister Valerie Thewlis organised the sale after Ms Hearld found the pinny and curlers in her aunt's wardrobe.
Ms Hearld told the Manchester Evening News there was a note attached to the garment which read: "Hilda's curlers, headscarf and pinny."
The outfit was synonymous with Hilda, who wore them from the first time she appeared on the soap in 1964 until her last episode in 1987.
A spokeswoman for auctioneers Outhwaite and Litherland said: "Jean was loved by millions of people all over the world as Aunt Hilda, she was even big in Australia, so we are expecting interest from all over.
"It is difficult to say how much things will sell for, it's the unknown. It will be down to her star power."
Alexander died in October last year at the age of 90.
The sale will take place at the Royal Clifton Hotel Southport on May 17.
