The former presenter of Blue Peter, This Morning and Wheel of Fortune was questioned in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 22-year-old woman in Edinburgh last year.
Mr Leslie told the Sunday Mirror police had informed him three days ago he would not face action over the claims.
He said he expected the investigation to formally end this week.
But he said that until he receives the paperwork the file would officially stay open.
He told the newspaper of his relief and anger about the impact the allegations had on his family and career.
"The police have informed me there will be no further action and I will not be charged," he said.
"While I am glad to be cleared, I have served a hefty punishment for a crime that never was. The damage to my parents and to me is incalculable."
He added: "It's so clearly not fair. I'm an innocent man and I'm thrown to the wolves."
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Police in Edinburgh are continuing to investigate the circumstances following a report of a sexual assault of a 22-year-old woman, which took place between Thursday 19 November and Friday 20 November in Edinburgh."
