Child tax credits Q&A: What do the cuts mean for Northern Ireland?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Westminster government is signalling that it will cut tax credits in the July budget as part of plan to reduce welfare spending by £12bn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It appears as though the focus will be on child tax credits. What impact might that have in Northern Ireland?
They are effectively a means-tested benefit paid to people on lower incomes. They are paid to two main groups: unemployed people with children and low paid working people who may or may not have children.
They are perhaps popularly thought of as a state top-up for low paid working people. There are two types of tax credit: Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit - it is the latter that seems likely to be cut.
It is paid at a maximum rate of £2,780 per child per year and you are entitled to the full amount until your annual income reaches just over £16,000. Then, there is a formula that sees the amount you get taper away as your income rises. It also depends on the size of your family.
It is a significant number - on the most recent figures there are 140,000 families in Northern Ireland who get child tax credits. About 89,000 are families where someone is working. If we look at working families who only claim the child element of tax credits, it is worth on average £4,000 a year. So we are talking about a significant payment to a large number of people.
The government has promised to cut £12bn from the benefits bill and has not left very much room for manoeuvre. Before the election David Cameron said he would not touch pensioner benefits, which is the largest part of the benefits bill. He also said he would not make any more changes to child benefit.
After that, there are only three areas of spending where you could find savings that are big enough: disability benefits, housing benefits and tax credits.
In June, Newsnight reported that the government was considering cutting child tax credits back to the level they were at in 2004 which, by my calculation, means the maximum amount per child would drop from £2,780 to less than £2,000.
Tax credits are, as the name suggests, a tax matter controlled by HM Revenue and Customs. That means they are not part of devolved welfare powers and Stormont will have no ability to block any changes. However, in the future tax credits will be phased out and replaced by Universal Credit, something Stormont will have power over.
