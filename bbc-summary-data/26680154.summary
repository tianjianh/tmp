The ceremony, the biggest in the UK theatre calendar, takes place at the Royal Opera House in London on 13 April.
Olivier award-winner Julie Walters will provide the voiceover at the event.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Stephen Sondheim's Merrily We Roll Along are the most nominated shows, with seven nods apiece.
Dame Judi Dench, Lesley Manville, Jude Law and Tom Hiddleston are among the acting nominees.
Arterton is to star in a West End musical version of 2010 film Made in Dagenham in November.
The former Bond girl will take the lead role of Rita O'Grady, a part played on the big screen by Sally Hawkins.
At the start of this year she played the lead in The Duchess of Malfi at the new Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London.
Stephen Mangan's most recent stage outing has been in the Olivier-nominated Jeeves & Wooster comedy, Perfect Nonsense.
This year's Olivier set will be designed by one of this year's nominees, Es Devlin.
The stage designer was behind the London 2012 Olympic Closing Ceremony and, most recently, provided the set for the new musical I Can't Sing!
She is nominated for an Olivier Award this year for her designs for the play Chimerica.
