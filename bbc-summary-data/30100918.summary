[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Avraham Shmuel Goldberg was one of four people killed when two people attacked worshippers with knives, axes and guns. The attackers were shot dead by police.
Mr Goldberg, 68, held dual UK-Israeli citizenship and lived in north London for many years before moving to Israel, according to Jewish News.
The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death.
Mr Goldberg had five daughters and one son, aged between 20 and 40.
He is thought to have attended the Liverpool Institute High School For Boys. His wife Bryna, from north-west London, is a teacher.
A cousin of Mr Goldberg, Michelle Hirschfield from north-west London, said he was a peaceful man with no political involvement.
She said: "My cousin Rabbi Abraham Goldberg [was] born and brought up in Liverpool and then lived and worked in London before going with his family to live in Israel.
"He leaves a widow and six children, many grandchildren and great grandchildren.
"I heard the news this morning so texted my cousin to check he was OK. When I heard nothing back, I called my sister who lives nearby.
"She tried calling him too but when she got no reply she went to the house. Abraham's son was there - very distressed.
"After a while, my sister called me to say that he had indeed been killed. And killed in such a brutal and awful way. He only wanted peace."
Mr Goldberg worked as a chemical engineer in London and Israel, specialising in the pharmaceutical industry.
He was also involved in setting up educational facilities in Jerusalem to allow religious students to learn more about the secular world.
UK Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter he was "appalled by today's horrific attack" and that his "thoughts are with the victims' families".
The other three victims, Moshe Twersky, Arieh Kupinsky and Kalman Levi have all been named as dual US-Israeli citizens.
US Secretary of State John Kerry denounced the attack as an "act of pure terror and senseless brutality and violence".
British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond also condemned the violence.
Speaking alongside Mr Kerry, he said: "I'd like to join Secretary Kerry in condemning absolutely the attack that took place in Jerusalem, and share his call for leaders to step up across the board and condemn what has happened in this religious place."
