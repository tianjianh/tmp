Andrew Pykett, 38, from Warwickshire, who called himself English Daddy online, abused 10 victims from across the UK and one in the US, police said.
The offences covered more than 10 years from 2004 to 2016, and involved teenagers aged between 13 and 16.
He pleaded guilty to 20 counts of sexual activity with a child, seven counts of meeting a child following sexual grooming and other charges.
Det Sgt Collette O'Keefe, from Warwickshire Police, said Pykett, of Clarendon Avenue, Leamington Spa, had a fetish where he liked to roleplay and pretend to be father figure to his victims.

He would groom them before sexually exploiting them, with one girl reporting her hands were bound behind her back during sex.
Pykett, who ran an IT business, sought his victims out nationwide and would often drive to collect them and bring them back to Leamington Spa, she said.
Checks on his computers and phones revealed sexualised conversations, indecent images and graphic sexual abuse of children from all parts of the UK and further afield, including South Yorkshire, Essex, London, Wiltshire, South Wales, Nottingham, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Chesterfield and Cleveland, Tennessee in the US.
Describing Pykett as a sexual predator, Ms O'Keefe said he came to the attention of police in November 2015 after a member of the public contacted the NSPCC after they saw him kissing and inappropriately touching a very young girl in South Yorkshire.
She appealed for other victims to come forward to police.
"I think we have just hit the tip of the iceberg," she said.
"In total I think there's going to be a lot more victims out there and I'd appeal for them to come forward."
She praised the ones that had come forward for helping convict "an extremely dangerous man".
