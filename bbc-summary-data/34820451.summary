Flood warnings as rain sweeps in to parts of Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Flood alerts have been issued in parts of Scotland amid warnings of heavy and persistent rain.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency listed nine areas where flooding may occur.
They include Argyll and Bute, Ayrshire and Arran, Central, Dumfries and Galloway, Edinburgh and Lothians, Fife, Scottish Borders, Tayside and west central Scotland.
A red warning that flooding is expected covers part of Tayside.
The Met Office also warned travel could be disrupted as a result of flooding.
It has issued an amber "be prepared" warning of heavy and persistent rain at times in parts of south west Scotland, Lothian, the Borders and Strathclyde after 17:00 on Saturday.
There is also a yellow "be aware" warning for parts of south west Scotland, Central, Tayside and Fife.
In Dumfries and Galloway, Argyll and Bute, East Ayrshire, North Ayrshire and South Ayrshire, the rain is likely to ease for a time on Sunday morning before further heavy rain arrives on Sunday afternoon.
The rain will be especially heavy over hills exposed to a strengthening southwesterly wind.
The warnings came in the wake of Storm Abigail, which brought gusts of up to 84mph to parts of Scotland on Friday.
High winds and rain were followed by wintry showers which affected driving conditions in parts of the Highlands.
