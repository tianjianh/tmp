Slovakian Imrich Joni, 20, stabbed and strangled Gordon Bolan, 68, at a flat in Kenmure Street in Pollokshields last summer.
An earlier trial at the High Court in Edinburgh heard that Joni hid the pensioner's body in a wardrobe.
Judge Lady Scott described it as "a brutal murder" which had left Mr Bolam's family "utterly devastated".
Joni, who lived at various addresses in the south side of Glasgow, murdered Mr Bolam at a date between 29 June and 14 July 2016.
In April, he was found guilty of murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
When he appeared for sentencing on Tuesday, the court heard the 20-year-old - who had denied any wrongdoing during his week long trial - had now accepted he killed Mr Bolam.
The court was told he had expressed "genuine remorse" for his actions because he could not continue living with "the lie" of denying his guilt.
His trial heard that Joni struck Mr Bolam with a knife before throttling him with a piece of fabric at an address in Kenmure Street. He then concealed his victim's remains in a bedroom wardrobe.
In a bid to cover up his crime and destroy DNA evidence, the murderer then washed upholstery, floors and other surfaces.
He also got rid of his trainers and the clothing he was wearing on the day he murdered Mr Bolam.
But Joni was caught after detectives found his DNA around Mr Bolam's property. Forensic scientists also discovered his DNA on the ligature which was placed around Mr Bolam's throat.
Defence advocate John Scott QC told the court that his client was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder caused by years of being physically abused by a family member.
Telling Joni that he was likely to be deported from the UK following his release from custody, judge Lady Scott said: "Mr Bolam was a man who struggled with ill health but nevertheless lived a normal life. He was a much-loved member of his community.
"His family have been left bereft and utterly devastated by his death.
"I accept that you have expressed genuine remorse. I also take into account that you have suffered emotional and physical abuse and that you are a young man with post traumatic stress disorder.
"This was a brutal murder. Balancing all these factors I have decided that you must serve at least 13 years before you become eligible to apply for parole."
