Pep Guardiola: Barcelona & Bayern Munich 'would have sacked' Man City boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says he would have been sacked by former clubs Barcelona and Bayern Munich if he had ended a season without a trophy.

City have failed to win any silverware in Guardiola's debut season, and are not yet guaranteed a top-four Premier League finish with two games to play.
Guardiola's side lost in the Champions League last 16, FA Cup semi-finals and League Cup fourth round.
"In my situation at a big club, I'm sacked. I'm out," said the Spaniard.
"If it is Barcelona and Bayern, you don't win and you are out. Here I have a second chance and I will try to do it better next season."
City may have to win both of their final league games to secure third place ahead of Liverpool and Arsenal and clinch direct qualification into next season's Champions League.
They host eighth-placed West Brom on Tuesday before Sunday's trip to Watford, who are 16th.
The former Spain international succeeded Manuel Pellegrini as City manager last summer, arriving with high expectations after success-packed spells at both Barcelona and Bayern.
A former Barca midfielder, the 46-year-old led the Catalan club to 14 trophies in four years, including three La Liga titles and two Champions Leagues, between 2008 and 2012.
After taking a year-long sabbatical, he joined German giants Bayern in 2013 and won the Bundesliga in each of his three seasons at the Allianz Arena.
Bayern also won the German Cup in twice in that period, but Guardiola could not steer them past the Champions League semi-finals.
City fans hoped his arrival would lead to their first Premier League title in three seasons, but, despite winning their opening six games, they have faced a battle to finish in the top four.
Fifth-placed Arsenal are hoping to take advantage if City drop points over the next two games, but Guardiola has dismissed Gunners boss Arsene Wenger's concern that "some teams are on holiday".
"I never saw one player in my life go to the pitch and not try to win the game," he said.
"Arsenal play against Sunderland and Everton - one is relegated and one is in the Europa League - so it is the same situation."
