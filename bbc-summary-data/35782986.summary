The man, believed to be a 27-year-old from Kent, fractured his ankle after falling from Striding Edge on Helvellyn, stopping close to Red Tarn.
Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team said he was "extremely lucky" after he fell in "full-on winter conditions" at about 16:30 GMT on Thursday.
The walker was airlifted to hospital in Carlisle by the coastguard.
The rescue took about four hours, with support from the Penrith Mountain Rescue Team.
Mike Blakey, team leader, said: "I cannot stress enough that Helvellyn is in full winter conditions.
"If anyone is considering venturing onto Helvellyn, they must be properly equipped with an ice axe and crampons and the knowledge of to how to use them.
"We want everyone to enjoy the stunning mountains safely."
