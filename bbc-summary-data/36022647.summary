The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited a charity working with street children in India on the third day of their South Asia tour.

Prince William and Catherine saw how the Salaam Baalak Trust provides support for working children in Delhi.
Later, during a meeting with India's PM Narendra Modi, the duke discussed pressures on the steel industry, Prince William's spokesman said.
The royals are on a seven-day tour of India and neighbouring Bhutan.
The duke's discussion with Mr Modi comes during a crisis facing the UK's steel industry, which has been blamed on the "dumping" of Chinese steel, relatively high energy prices and the extra cost of climate change policies.
India's Tata Steel has begun the formal process of selling its loss-making UK business and UK MPs are to hold an emergency three-hour debate on the crisis.
The duke and duchess met Mr Modi at New Delhi's Hyderabad House, a former royal residence of maharajas that has hosted heads of state from across the globe.
Other issues that were discussed during the meeting included the strength of the UK-India relationship in areas including defence and security, opportunities for young people, conservation and the UK/India Year of Culture in 2017, the Press Association news agency reported quoting sources.
During their visit to the charity in Delhi, the duke asked: "What can we do to help?"
The charity's director, Sanjoy Roy, replied: "Spread the word. People think of them as street kids, beggars, thieves but they are just children.
"They deserve an education, future and a life. They have a right to a childhood."
They also visited a boys' home near Delhi station, where about 50 boys live in the four-storey building.
The duchess sat next to Shansad Abdul, 12, who asked her to draw a picture of her house.
Speaking through a translator, he said afterwards: "She was a very good lady and very happy to sit and draw with me."
The duke and duchess are due to travel to Kaziranga National Park, in the state of Assam, where over the next few days they will learn about the people and wildlife who inhabit the area.

This will be a chance for the Cambridges to contrast urban and rural life.
Leaving behind Mumbai and Delhi, they'll fly to the state of Assam and to Kaziranga National Park.
On the banks of the Brahmaputra river, the world heritage site - according to its website - excites the senses, arrests the soul and beckons a visit.
Like his father and his grandfather, conservation is in Prince William's Windsor blood.
At this wildlife site William and his wife will learn about the challenges that arise when humans and wild animals live in close proximity.
The couple will also see the work of the rangers as they battle with the poachers hell bent on acquiring rhino horn.
That ever-lucrative trade is destroying the population of the one-horned rhinoceros. Two-thirds of those still alive shelter in Kaziranga National Park.

The Kaziranga park, a world heritage site, is home to elephants, water buffalo, the endangered swamp deer, tigers, and two-thirds of the entire population of the Indian one-horned rhinoceros.
The national park visit coincides with the Bohag Bihu festival, the celebration of the Assamese new year, and in the evening around a camp fire, the duke and duchess will see dance and musical performances.
