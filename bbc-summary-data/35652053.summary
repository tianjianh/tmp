The 25-year-old was seventh in the 200m Commonwealth games breaststroke final and sixth in the 4x100m medley in 2014.
Glastonbury-based Holderness, along with English swimmer Tristan Slater, has so far raised almost Â£2,000 to swim in April's Olympic trials in Glasgow.
"The training costs associated with swimming are just incredible nowadays," he told BBC Somerset.
"You've got all the travel costs, accommodation, entry fees, and I have a job that I just can't do enough hours to make the money.
"We got told by the coaches to try this crowdfunding website and within two or three days we had two thousand pounds and that goes a long way."
