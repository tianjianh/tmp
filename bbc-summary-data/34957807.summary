Olympic cycling champion-turned-jockey Victoria Pendleton pulled up with two fences to clear in her first point-to-point race at Black Forest Lodge.

Prior to that, Pendleton's mount Minella Theatre had been jumping well in the Black Forest Club Members race.
The three-mile race was won by favourite Jepeck.
Pendleton, 35, who was unseated in her third competitive ride at Newbury last month, is aiming to ride over jumps at the Cheltenham Festival in March.
She retired from cycling in 2012 after adding gold in the keirin in London to the sprint title she won at the Beijing Games in 2008.
Trainer Alan Hill said the ground "was a little soft" for Minella Theatre, but that Pendleton had ridden him "sensibly" and would look to compete again within weeks.
"The most important thing was that we got her good race experience," said Hill. "The horse jumped well, she rode him well and now we've got that first ride under her belt."
