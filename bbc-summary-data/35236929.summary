Crocodile collector from Northampton claims world record

A man who has collected more than 6,000 novelty crocodiles is claiming a new world record.

Andrew Gray, who calls himself a 'crocoholic', keeps 6,739 crocodile related items at his home in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire.
He said he became the official 'biggest collector of crocodiles in the world' after breaking an existing record of 1,000 items.
He is using the collection to raise money for two hospices.
Guinness World Records could not be contacted for comment.
Mr Gray's obsession started 15 years ago with the purchase of his first novelty crocodile.
"I moved into a new house and I needed some new furniture, but instead I brought a really cool three foot wooden crocodile.
"I have ones made of wood, glass, metal, pottery, soft toys, china, plastic, marble, you name it I've got it," he said.
His favourite crocodile is a giant wooden one he found outside a cigar shop in Mexico and transported home via a ferry and two flights.
Mr Gray has agreed to donate 10p for every "like" his Facebook page receives, and recently gave Â£400 to the Cynthia Spencer Hospice, which cared for his father-in-law until he died.
John Helm, its fundraising manager, said: "People do many weird and wonderful things to support the hospice, but this collection and record is one of the weirdest.
"We're delighted he's chosen to support us in this way."
