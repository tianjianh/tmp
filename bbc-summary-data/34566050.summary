The Yorkshire all-rounder, 28, is joining Perth Scorchers for Australia's domestic Twenty20 competition, which starts on 21 December.
He misses five T20 matches in the United Arab Emirates, plus the one-day series in January.
The England and Wales Cricket Board says it will "support his continued development for England and Yorkshire".
ECB director of cricket Andrew Strauss added: "This is an excellent opportunity for David.
"It will be the ideal preparation for him leading into the ICC World T20 in India next year."
Willey, who left Northamptonshire at the end of last season to move to County Championship winners Yorkshire, will join the full England squad next month for the limited-overs matches against Pakistan in the UAE.
His replacement in the Lions squad will be named later.
