England coach Eddie Jones has ridiculed the Welsh Rugby Union for its stance on Joe Marler's "Gypsy boy" comment to Wales prop Samson Lee.

The WRU said it was "surprised" Marler  escaped punishment.
That came after both Wales head coach Warren Gatland and Lee described it as banter, although Gatland later apologised, while assistant Rob Howley criticised the England prop.
"Maybe the WRU don't know whether they are Arthur or Martha," said Jones.
Marler apologised after making the comment during England's 25-21 Six Nations win over Wales on Saturday.
Campaigners from the Traveller community - and figures inside the sport - had been critical of Marler and called for a ban.
At a news conference on Thursday, Jones refused to say whether the comment was racist, but said he had spoken to the 25-year-old, telling the player he had acted inappropriately.
"There was a decision made, that is what we have these judiciary committees for. I said I would let the process run its route - it has run its route," he added.
Marler also also avoided a sanction for striking Wales' Rob Evans during the Twickenham win.
Jones has dropped the loose-head to the bench, replacing him with Mako Vunipola for Saturday's Grand Slam clash with France in Paris.
But the Australian says the decision was not made as a punishment for Marler.
He added: "We were always going to start Mako. We've got a certain game plan we want to play against France and it suits us starting with Mako and Joe will come off the bench and do a great job for us".
