The 21-year-old has made one first-team appearance for the Swans and spent part of last season on loan at ADO Den Haag.
"He's somebody I looked at a couple of years back and he was at the age where they wanted to keep him," Cobblers boss Rob Page told BBC Radio Northampton.
"We'll have to be patient, he's not the finished article. If he was, he'd be playing in Swansea's first team."
