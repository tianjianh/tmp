[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chris Russell: Worcestershire to part company with paceman

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Worcestershire fast bowler Chris Russell is to leave New Road, having not been offered a new contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old from the Isle of Wight made his first-class debut against Warwickshire in August 2012, after taking six wickets in a tour match against South Africa at New Road.
He has played 17 further first-class games but only occasionally in limited-overs cricket in the past two years.
"It's always a tough time for people to be leaving," said boss Steve Rhodes.
"I think he'll look elsewhere to try and find another county. Wherever that might be, I wish him well."
