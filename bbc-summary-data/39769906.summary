Guy Hedger was shot by intruders who entered a house in St Ives, near Ringwood, Dorset, just after 03:00 BST on Sunday. He later died in hospital.
The men, who wore balaclavas, stole jewellery including designer watches before fleeing the property.
No arrests have been made and police have not recovered the shotgun used to kill the 61-year-old.
A helicopter was used to search the area following the shooting, which police believe was a planned burglary that turned violent.
Detectives said a second person who was in the Â£1m Castlewood property at the time of the break-in was "deeply affected by the incident" and is currently being supported by specially trained officers.
He lived in the property with his husband of 12 years, Simon-Pierre Hedger-Cooper, according to the Press Association.
Det Ch Insp Sarah Derbyshire said: "At this stage we are still trying to establish exactly what happened at the address and how and why the victim was shot dead.
"I am appealing for anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious in the area, or was in the area at that time, to contact Dorset Police as soon as possible."
A spokesman for his former employer, insurance firm Liverpool Victoria (LV), said: "We were all shocked to hear that our friend and colleague Guy Hedger... died over the weekend in such tragic circumstances.
"Our heartfelt condolences and sympathy are with his family and loved ones at this incredibly sad time."
Through his work as marketing and brand director at LV, Mr Hedger became a director at Avonbourne International and Business and Enterprise Trust, which runs colleges and a primary school in the Bournemouth area.
The trust's CEO Debbie Godfrey-Phuare said: "Guy was a very kind and generous man who volunteered and gave his time freely to Avonbourne.
"[He] had a deep passion for education and was dedicated to expanding the experience and knowledge of children in Bournemouth."
