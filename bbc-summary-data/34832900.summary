A French national has appeared in court charged with possessing an air rifle and a knife following a security alert at Gatwick Airport.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jerome Chauris, 41, from Vendome, was arrested on Saturday after major disruption at the North Terminal.
Documents before Crawley magistrates said the weapons were an MP5-calibre 4.5mm air rifle and a lock knife.
Mr Chauris was remanded in custody to appear before Lewes Crown Court on 14 December.
The court was told Mr Chauris, who identified himself with the help of an interpreter, had no fixed abode.
Thousands of passengers and airport staff were evacuated from the terminal before a controlled explosion on a suspicious package.
The North Terminal remained closed for six hours.
