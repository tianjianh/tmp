It was organised by the Workers' Party after the murder of Dan Murray on Monday night.
The protest took place on Wednesday night on the Grosvenor Road, close to where the 55-year-old takeaway delivery driver was shot.
The crowd was addressed by community and political representatives, who called for an end to the violence.
Police officers also handed out leaflets urging people to give information about crime to the police.
Monday night's murder was the third shooting in a 24-hour period.
A teenager and another man were also shot in paramilitary-style attacks in north Belfast.
Their injuries were not life-threatening.
Workers' Party representative Chris Bailie said people in west Belfast were "absolutely disgusted" by Mr Murray's and other violence in the area.
"We are here as a community to unite against these attacks," he said.
"We can't let these people think they can dictate the agenda and rule by fear and intimidation.
"They want to ignore democracy and the rule of law, but we can see by the growing crowds that people are willing to show their faces in the face of intimidation."
