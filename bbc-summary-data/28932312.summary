Pee, 27, broke the Briton's serve four times as she won 6-2 6-3 in one hour and 25 minutes on Court 11.
Konta, ranked 118, had direct entry into the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career.
Her defeat leaves Heather Watson, who plays on Tuesday, as the only British woman in the singles draw.
Watson faces Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the opening match on Court 13 at 16:00 BST.
Konta, 23, claimed her only previous win at a Grand Slam two years ago in New York but could not repeat the performance.
After recovering an early break, the Briton fell 5-2 behind and dropped the set in a dramatic 13-minute game.
Peer, the world number 155, needed just one break in the second set, fending off two late break-back points and sealing victory when Konta netted a backhand.
"I created opportunities for myself but I just wasn't able to take them today, which is frustrating and upsetting for me," said Konta, who was playing her third match back after four weeks off with a wrist injury.
"It was frustrating but she played tough on those points, credit to her."
Konta added: "It's a bonus getting direct acceptance but I want to be getting deeper into these tournaments and start winning more matches."
