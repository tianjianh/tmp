The two teams meet at the Olympic Park on Thursday with a place in the final against Netherlands or Ireland at stake.
"I can't wait," Hoare told BBC Sport. "It will be a tough match.
"But we have shown in the past we can beat anybody on our day."

England bounced back from their loss against Netherlands to beat Spain 4-0 on Tuesday night.
It was a morale-boosting win after player Mark Gleghorne revealed there had been some "home truths" aired following the 2-0 loss by the Dutch.
"We played how we wanted to," added captain Barry Middleton. "We're trying to stay as level as we can throughout the tournament.
"We got our rewards from the intensity we showed in the first half. We tired them out then got the rewards."
