[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derelict Holyhead market hall to be restored after 10 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Holyhead's Grade II-listed market hall is to be restored after standing derelict for 10 years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It will house the town's library, a cafe, community space, and Anglesey's local history collection.
Built in 1855, it was home to assembly rooms and a court.
Last month, the Welsh Government successfully applied for a compulsory purchase order on the former owner of the market hall and the work is being funded by a Â£2.3m lottery grant.
