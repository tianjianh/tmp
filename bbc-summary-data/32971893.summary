[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police said the 25-year-old man may have had a "disagreement with a group of men" outside the Standard Bearer pub in Binley, Coventry, on 24 May.
It is believed he was then chased and assaulted in Deerdale Way where he was found in a garden.
Det Sgt Louise Hanlon said the man had been left "with potentially life-changing injuries".
"Whoever is responsible for this attack needs to be arrested and brought to justice, and I would urge anyone who was at the pub the Sunday before last and witnessed the dispute outside to contact us," she said.
