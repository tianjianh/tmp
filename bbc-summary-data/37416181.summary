About 2,000 tonnes of woodchip has been alight at South Wales Wood Recycling in Coity, since 03:30 BST on Monday.
The cause of the blaze is not yet know, but the company said the "circumstances were suspicious".
In light of the fire, the firm said it was withdrawing an application to open a new plant in South Cornelly.
In a statement, the company said: "Following the recent ongoing incident at our facility in Heol y Cyw, in light of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident and our ongoing investigation, for the safety/protection of our employees, their families and the business we have decided to withdraw our planning application for the proposed recycling site in South Cornelly.
"All efforts are being focused on ensuring the ongoing incident can be brought to a swift conclusion and we continue to work diligently and fully cooperate with Natural Resources Wales and the South Wales Fire and Rescue Service to achieve this."
The withdrawal comes after opposition from residents who had raised concerns about the plans following previous fires at the firm's other sites in Maesteg and Newport.
They set up a campaign page on Facebook also highlighting other issues including extra traffic and dust.
On Tuesday, Susan Dobbs, who lives near the Coity plant, said some of the trees surrounding the plant were on fire and she was surprised the nearby road had not been cordoned off.
She added: "It's raging again this morning. The plume of smoke is really, really high. Our house absolutely reeks of acrid smoke."
