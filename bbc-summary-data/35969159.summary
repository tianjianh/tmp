The members of the organised crime gang, from Cambridgeshire, Essex, London, the West Midlands and Belfast were found guilty by jury after a series of trials at Birmingham Crown Court.
They were involved in organising two thefts and an attempted theft at Durham University Oriental Museum as well as further incidents at Gorringes Auction House in Lewes, Norwich Castle Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge.

A further seven members of the gang were jailed on Monday:
A 14th gang member, Robert Gilbert-Smith, 27, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty on 10 March 2015 and was sentenced to 15 months in jail on 27 April 2015.
The gang hit the jackpot when their hired burglars made off with jade valued at about £15m from Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum, but before that not everything went to plan:
Det Supt Adrian Green, from Durham Constabulary, who led a four-year covert investigation to bring the gang to justice, said the case had been "like putting together a huge jigsaw with no picture to go on".
"Because of the complexity we were only able to get a conspiracy to steal and that's capped at seven years, which is a bit of a shame."
Some of the sentences were fairly short compared to the seven, eight or nine-year sentences handed to some of those who carried out the burglaries, he said.
"I'm just really pleased that we've been able to bring them to justice."
