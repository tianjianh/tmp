David Edwards death: Wife denies murder of 'jealous' husband

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A newlywed wept in court as she denied murdering her husband who she said was "jealous" and verbally abusive.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sharon Edwards, 42, denies killing solicitor David Edwards with a kitchen knife at their home in Chorley, Lancashire, in August 2015.
The 51-year-old was found dead two months after the pair married in Las Vegas, Manchester Crown Court heard.
Mrs Edwards admitted holding the knife that killed him but denies deliberately pushing it into him.
She claims her husband walked into the knife and together they cleaned up the blood before having sex.
The defendant told the court their relationship had been "very intense, very passionate, very loving".
But she said her husband was jealous and would call her a "whore" and a "slut" when stressed, and say "16" to her, referring to her teenage pregnancy.
The court heard the couple drank every other day and that it became "out of control".
Mrs Edwards said her husband would regularly fall over after drinking and had begun to drink more prior to his death.
She said he "absolutely hated" his job following the merger of his company and "couldn't cope", even crying when he came home from work on occasions.
Mr Edwards was found dead with a 3in (8cm) stab wound to the heart.
Giving evidence on the first day of her defence, Mrs Edwards began to cry as she was asked whether at any time she had intended to kill her husband.
She replied: "No I didn't. I loved him."
She also denied being responsible for "50 to 60" injuries found on his body.
The prosecution has claimed Mrs Edwards was repeatedly abusive towards her husband, and was heard telling him she was going to kill him in a row shortly before his death.
She admitting slapping him across the face on one occasion, and was subsequently arrested but later released.
Questioned in court about a black eye he received on honeymoon in Las Vegas, Mrs Edwards says her husband accidentally hit himself in the face with a bedside phone in the hotel.
Asked about a split lip he received soon after returning home from the wedding, she said he had fallen out of bed whilst drunk and hit his face on a bedside table.
Mr Edwards was said to have kept the domestic violence a secret, insisting that his injuries were accidental, the court heard.
He was recorded saying his new wife could "knock him out with one punch" and that she hit "rather hard", disclosing to a friend that she had "picked up a glass coffee table and hit him over the head with it".
The jury was also played wedding footage of Mrs Edwards declaring her love for her new husband in Las Vegas, two months before she allegedly murdered him.
In the nine-minute clip, she can be heard telling her partner: "One year ago today you entered my life and I can honestly say you turned it upside down and swept me off my feet.
"You have shown me what true love is."
She adds: "You have seen me at my best and you have seen me at my worst, just like I have seen you at your best and worst.
"Today on June 28, 2015, all our lives start and I can't wait for the amazing journey."
The trial continues.
