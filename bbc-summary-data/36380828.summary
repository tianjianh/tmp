Davies worked under Rodgers at Swansea and Liverpool, and the new Celtic boss is thrilled to bring him to Glasgow.
"I am delighted to bring Chris to Celtic, he is a magnificent coach and someone I know will make a hugely positive contribution to the club.
"He is ready and prepared for the challenge at Celtic," Rodgers said.
Davies, 31, will start work at Celtic on 1 June and is relishing the challenge of working with the Scottish champions.
"Celtic is a huge club with such a special place in world football," he said.
"It is a great honour and a proud moment for me to be named assistant manager.
"I saw the scenes at Celtic Park on Monday and there are not many clubs or fans in the world who could have put on such a show.
"We know what Celtic fans bring to the club and we want to reward our fans every week with entertaining football that gets results."
Davies knows Rodgers well having played under him in the Reading youth team. Rodgers then took his old team-mate with him to join his coaching staff at Swansea and again at Liverpool.
"I have worked with Brendan over a number of years, as a player and a coach, and it will be fantastic to team up with him again," Davies continued.
"I know all about his affection for Celtic and his appetite for taking on this great job.
"I am looking forward to meeting all the players and staff and working with them to give the supporters a team to be proud of."
