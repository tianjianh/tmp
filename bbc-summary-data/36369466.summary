Billy Heath: North Ferriby United manager to take over at FC Halifax Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby United head coach Billy Heath has taken over as manager of FC Halifax Town on a two-year contract.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Heath and assistant Mark Carroll, who is also leaving, led North Ferriby into the National League earlier this month.
FC Halifax Town were relegated on the last day of the season but won the FA Trophy at Wembley on Sunday.
"The club would like to thank them for their tremendous work ethic and remarkable achievements during this period," a club statement read.
The duo joined North Ferriby in 2011 and led the club through two promotions and to FA Trophy victory in 2015.
Jim Harvey took over as Halifax manager in December, but could not prevent them from being relegated as they finished 23rd in the National League.
