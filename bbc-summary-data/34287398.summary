US repatriates first Chinese Sky Net suspect Yang Jinjun

The United States has repatriated one of China's most wanted criminal suspects, China's Communist Party said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Yang Jinjun, who is accused of bribery and embezzlement, fled to the US in 2001, state media said.
He is the first alleged fugitive to be brought to China under the high-profile Sky Net initiative, the party's internal disciplinary body said.
The plan is aimed at helping bring to justice corrupt Chinese officials who have fled overseas.
In April, Beijing published a list of 100 wanted economic fugitives.
It is part of efforts spearheaded by President Xi Jinping to crack down on rampant corruption and comes ahead of a state visit by him to the US next week.
China does not have an extradition treaty with the US.
In the past US officials have asked for more evidence from the Chinese government before helping to track down those wanted under Sky Net, says the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing.
But according to Chinese anti-corruption officials Mr Yang was brought to China as a result of "close co-operation" between the Chinese and American authorities.
The repatriation comes days before Mr Xi's state visit to the US.
He is expected to travel to Seattle on 22 September before visiting Washington and New York, where he is due to give a speech to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
