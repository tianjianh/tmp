[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Total was tackling the incident below the seabed in a well being drilled from the Elgin B platform.
The company said there had been an "unexpected flow" about 4km below the seabed last month.
A spokesman for Total said: "Operations have now been completed and the bottom part of the well has been successfully cemented."
The company added: "At all times the well was under control at the surface and there was no loss of containment.
"Precautionary measures that were put in place during the operations, such as restricting access to essential personnel only and also the reduction of production, have now been lifted."
