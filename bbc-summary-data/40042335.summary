The RSPCA said the six-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier-cross was found at 22.30 BST on Tuesday by a member of the public on Dorset Road, Saltley, Birmingham.
He was taken to the city's animal hospital but had to be put to sleep by a vet on Wednesday morning.
The charity said it was investigating the "sickening" case.
It said when officers found the dog he was alive in the tightly-tied bag but "in a bad way" with three large wounds.
RSPCA inspector Mike Scargill, who is investigating, said: "Quite simply, this poor dog was left to die in a bin bag alone at the side of a road.
"He was dumped like a piece of rubbish.
"It is not acceptable to treat an animal in this way and I am sure that many people will be sickened to hear that someone did this to an innocent dog.
"This dog suffered a great deal unnecessarily and we are keen to find out who did this.
"We are appealing to anyone who may have information regarding the extremely callous and degrading behaviour that this poor dog was subjected to during the last days of his life to contact us."
