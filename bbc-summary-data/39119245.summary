[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has suspended Czech-registered Van Air's permission to fly in the UK following an incident on the Isle of Man during Storm Doris on 23 February.
The Wales north-south air link began in 2007 and receives around Â£1m of Welsh Government subsidy every year.
Danish operator North Flying Airport Service will now operate the service.
The CAA said passengers can still book flights as normal.
A CAA spokesman said the incident last Thursday is being investigated by the Czech civil aviation authorities, which regulates Van Air.
"The safety of the travelling public is always our number one priority and we remain in contact with the relevant parties," he said.
This is the second time an operator of the Wales north-south air link has been grounded for safety reasons.
In 2015, the CAA revoked the air operators licence of Links Air.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: "Van Air has sub-contracted Danish operator North Flying for the short-term operation of the route, allowing the service to continue to run as normal.
"The CAA is aware of this arrangement and has raised no issues with the Welsh Government."
