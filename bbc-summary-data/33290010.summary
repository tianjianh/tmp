Satnam Singh Bamarra was drafted by the Dallas Mavericks as their 52nd pick.
The Mavericks website said "Singh averaged 4.2 points and 2.7 rebounds in six games at the 2013 FIBA Asia Championships".
#SatnamSingh began trending on Twitter India, with many users cheering his selection.
One of the first to tweet his congratulations was India basketball coach Scott Fleming.
And India cricket captain Virat Kohli responded enthusiastically to the "great news".
Bollywood star Aamir Khan tweeted about what an "inspiration" Singh was.
Other Twitter users in India cheered his selection, with some saying that it marked an important moment for Indian basketball.
The 19-year-old sportsman is from a tiny village called Ballo Ke, in Punjab, where his parents are farmers.
An ESPN profile on the player says that the villagers' term for him translates from the Punjabi as "little one".
Singh has been in the United States since September 2010 as part of a scholarship programme between IMG and Reliance, a leading company in India, according to a report in Sports Illustrated.
The online excitement around Satnam Singh came a day after users took to Twitter to deride Louisiana senator Bobby Jindal after he announced that he would join the Republican presidential race.
The hashtag #BobbyJindalIsSoWhite began trending in India as users poked fun at Mr Jindal's speech and alleged attempts to distance himself from his Indian heritage.
