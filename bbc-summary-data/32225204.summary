A mother accused of murdering her newborn baby has described her panic and fear after giving birth to what she believed was a stillborn girl.

Claudia Martins who lived with her sister Vilma in Bristol denies killing the baby at their home last year.
She told Bristol Crown Court: "I was really panicking. I was really scared. She wasn't moving - they would think I had done something to hurt her."
Ms Martins, who said she did not know she was pregnant, denies murder.
The jury heard how Ms Martins gave birth on 12 September.
The prosecution asked if she had called for help from her sister or an ambulance. But she replied she was panicked and scared as the baby "was not moving".
Ms Martins added: "I hid her inside my suitcase close to the bed... I don't know, I was in [a] panic. It was a feeling I'd never felt before.
"I felt my blood was boiling, my head was spinning - I don't know how to describe it."
Following the birth paramedics and police were called to the home but Ms Martins had already been taken to hospital.
Three days later officers found the baby's body in a suitcase at the home. The court heard toilet paper was found inside her mouth.
When the prosecution asked how the toilet paper came to be in her baby's mouth she said: "I don't know, I can't remember."
The case continues.
