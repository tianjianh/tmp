People living and working in a town ravaged by floods have said they are still struggling to recover from the devastation six months on.

Scores of homes and businesses in Tadcaster were damaged by flooding at Christmas, while the bridge across the River Wharfe collapsed on 29 December.
Some residents are still waiting to return home and one shopkeeper said trade was down by about 25%.
Meanwhile, a fund to help those affected has raised about £26,000.
Alex Bailey was forced to abandon her home in Wharfe Bank Terrace on Boxing Day.
She said: "At the start of it we really had no idea what we were in for, but I truly never envisaged that we would be six months on and still not be able to live here. It has been truly awful."
Within days of the bridge collapsing, the government pledged £3m for repair work and a further £1.4m was awarded to the scheme by the regions Local Enterprise Partnership to enable it to be widened and strengthened.
But with work not due to be completed until the end of the year, people can now only cross the river via a temporary footbridge.
Mr Bailey said: "Even now, on the high street, I feel like there's nobody there. You think 'Can Tadcaster actually get through this? Will we get back? Will the town thrive and flourish?'.
"The bridge is the lifeline of the town, we really need that back."
Butcher Nick Devine estimated he had lost up to a quarter of his trade as a result of the flooding and, in particular, the collapse of the bridge.
He said: "There's no passing trade. We always knew it was going to be tough this year, but we're getting by.
"When the bridge is back up and running it will come back and we know it will."
North Yorkshire county councillor Don MacKenzie, who has responsibility for highways, said: "What was a pretty devastating occurrence last December 29 could well lead to a silver-lining - improvement for the bridge for the town of Tadcaster."
