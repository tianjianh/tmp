[SN]TITLE[SN]
Watford v West Bromwich Albion

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Watford will be without defender Younes Kaboul, who suffered a hamstring injury at the weekend which could rule him out for the rest of the season.

Troy Deeney and Sebastian Prodl might start after only being fit enough for the substitutes' bench on Saturday.
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis says he will make a late decision on the "one or two" unnamed players who picked up knocks against Manchester United.
Matt Phillips could be involved following a hamstring injury.
John Roder: "A top-ten finish is certainly a target for West Brom, and it may well also be for Watford, who are only outside the top half of the table on goal difference coming into this match.
"Tony Pulis' side will be confident of repeating their win over Watford back in December, following good results against Arsenal and Manchester United.
"However, Watford's victory over Sunderland on Saturday not only halted a poor run, but has taken the inconsistent Hornets a step closer to securing a place in next season's Premier League - something which the Baggies have surely already achieved."

Watford head coach Walter Mazzarri: "Until the table says mathematically we are safe, then we are not.
"We don't even need to think about that - we need to think about the game against West Brom.
"We must improve on the last pass and we need to improve our finishing."
West Brom head coach Tony Pulis: "Watford are a good side with a good squad of players. Lots of pace and power in the team.
"We know it's going to be a tough game. The Premier League is about coming up against teams with different strengths."
