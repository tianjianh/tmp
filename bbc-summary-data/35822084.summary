[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who raped and attacked women he was seeing - some of whom were pregnant - has been jailed for a total of eight years and eight months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven Mays, 40, of Irvine, North Ayrshire, was convicted of 14 charges against eight women dating back to 1996 in Ayrshire and Renfrewshire.
Mays claimed he was "respectful" to women but jurors heard he had taken naked photos of some while they slept.
He was also ordered to be monitored for four years after release from prison.
Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Matthews told Mays evidence had exposed a "campaign of physical and sexual violence".
"I am satisfied that you are a serial offender and you present a risk to any future partner," the judge said.
"I have to both punish you for these offences and try to protect, as far as I can, any woman who may fall under your influence."
Mays first victim was a woman he dated between 1995 and 1997.
He attacked her and repeatedly raped the woman, now aged 38, including at a house in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, when she was pregnant.
Mays met his next victim, now aged 38, at a bar in Irvine around 2000.
He beat her with a clothes iron after she became pregnant, punched her on the face and grabbed her by the throat.
Mays then went on to rape her while she was asleep and also raped her in 2002 at a house in Stewarton.
He also sent the woman naked photos of herself he had taken without her knowing.
In 2011, he then sexually assaulted a third victim, now aged 40, at a property in Kilwinning.
Like the second woman, he molested her while she was asleep.
Mays denied all the accusations and claimed he was "just a normal, happy guy" who had "made mistakes" but was "respectful" towards women.
He was convicted of two rape charges against the first woman, assault and a charge under the Communications Act.
Mays was also found guilty of raping and assaulting his second victim as well as sending her explicit messages.
He was further convicted of sexually assaulting the third woman.
Mays admitted sending sexually explicit texts and photos to five different women between 2004 and 2014.
It emerged he was already a sex offender having been convicted of sending obscene Facebook messages to a teenage girl in 2012.
