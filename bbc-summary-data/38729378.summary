Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city's Sauchiehall Street on Monday at about 21:45.
A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken.
The area around the bank, which is near the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police.
Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of Â£50,000.
Following the robbery, the three men got into a white Seat Leon car, which sped off along West Nile Street towards the Cowcaddens area.
The car has since been found in Scott Street, near Stow College. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination.
Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on West Nile Street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery.
Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them.
The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities.
Det Insp Alasdair Barlow said: "We are reviewing CCTV images in and around the city centre.
"We would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist.
"As the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed."
