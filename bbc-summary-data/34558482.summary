West Ham United 2-1 Chelsea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea had midfielder Nemanja Matic and manager Jose Mourinho sent off as Andy Carroll's late winner dealt their faltering title defence another blow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mauro Zarate fired the Hammers in front when Chelsea failed to clear a corner.
Matic was sent off after being booked twice in nine minutes before the break, and Mourinho joined him after speaking to referee Jon Moss at half-time.
Gary Cahill levelled from a corner but Carroll met Aaron Cresswell's cross to send the Hammers third in the table.
Chelsea, who have now lost five of their first 10 Premier League games this season, continue to languish in the bottom half.
As well as Matic and Mourinho, the Blues' assistant first-team coach Silvino Louro was also dismissed.
Chelsea had five other players booked in a stormy east versus west London derby, the last to be played at Upton Park in the league before West Ham move to the Olympic Stadium next summer.
Zarate's goal, after Dimitri Payet's corner was not cleared, meant West Ham led at the break but his goal was not the decisive moment of the first half.
That came when Matic slipped out on the right by-line and dragged down Diafra Sakho.
The Chelsea midfielder had been booked nine minutes earlier for hauling back Cheikhou Kouyate as West Ham looked to break.
Referee Moss took his time before showing Matic a second yellow card, which brought a furious response from Chelsea.
Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas were booked as the visiting players lost their discipline, while Louro was sent from the bench.
Mourinho continued his protests at half-time and was sent to the stands for the second half after going to speak to Moss in the referee's room.
He was stood among West Ham fans when Carroll scored, but disappeared from view soon afterwards.
Matic's first booking came seconds after Chelsea thought they had equalised.
Kurt Zouma rose to head Cesc Fabregas's corner goalwards, but a combination of defender Carl Jenkinson and goalkeeper Adrian kept it out - just - before the whole ball crossed the line.
Chelsea were also denied by another marginal decision when a Fabregas goal was ruled out for offside moments before Matic was dismissed.
When Chelsea did draw level, through Cahill's opportunistic second-half finish from Willian's corner, West Ham rethought their approach.
Hammers boss Slaven Bilic threw on Carroll for the last 20 minutes and the home side began pumping crosses into the box.
Carroll is yet to start a Premier League game this season because of a summer setback following a serious knee injury in February, but is getting closer to full fitness.
He was not just on for match minutes against Chelsea, however, and had the desired impact with his first goal since January.
"It's impossible to mark him in the box," Bilic said afterwards.
"His quality was never in question. If he's in good shape now we have a good chance that he will be injury-free for a long time. In that case West Ham and England will benefit from that a lot."
When asked about the mood in the dressing room, Chelsea defender Gary Cahill told BBC Sport: "It is not great - like you'd imagine when you lose games. Last season we weren't used to it.

"The lads are devastated. Not many words are being said at the moment. I'm sure we'll reflect in [the] next day or so.
"You're left scratching your head sometimes. In the first half the Fabregas goal could have been given and we had the ball that was nearly over the line. That sums up the way we're going.
"And then we've got the sending off. Originally we played on - we thought the referee had played on. Maybe the assistant called it back, I'm not sure sure what's happened there.
"We've not had the rub of the green, but we're not feeling sorry for ourselves. We have to work hard to turn this round."
West Ham go to Vicarage Road on Saturday to face Watford in their next Premier League game, while Chelsea's next test is against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday.
