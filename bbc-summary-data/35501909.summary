[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour names Gregory as election campaign co-ordinator

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Welsh Labour has named outgoing Ogmore AM Janice Gregory as its new campaign co-ordinator for the assembly election.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
She takes over from Huw Irranca-Davies, the Ogmore MP who is now seeking election to Cardiff Bay himself.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said being a candidate meant Mr Irranca-Davies had to stand aside as co-ordinator, but said Mrs Gregory would "marshal our resources with great skill".
She said she would "build on the solid foundations" her colleague had made.
