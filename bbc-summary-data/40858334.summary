Reading 2-1 Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Reading picked up their first league win of the season courtesy of two second-half goals against Aston Villa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Glenn Whelan deflected an Adrian Popa shot in off his own post for Reading's opener before Mo Barrow poked home his first goal for the hosts.
Midfielder Conor Hourihane pulled a goal back late on for Villa from Gabby Agbonlahor's chest down.
Defeat left Steve Bruce's side still searching for their first win of the Championship campaign.
Villa have just one point from their opening three games, while Reading made amends for failing to take all three points in a 1-1 draw at home against 10-man Fulham on Saturday.
Chances were scarce in a goalless first half, but Romania international Popa twice forced Villa goalkeeper Sam Johnstone into reflex saves.
Popa's right-foot shot after cutting in off the left wing was aided by both Whelan's deflection and the introduction of goal-line technology in the Championship this season.
After a moment's pause, referee Kevin Friend and his assistants were able to award Reading their opener, despite Johnstone's efforts to claw it away along the line to safety.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"It was pleasing how we played. From the start we were very aggressive, sharp and concentrated in what we were doing.
"After giving away an early chance, I thought we dominated possession and the chances and should have scored more goals.
"We should have made it a lot more comfortable for ourselves by scoring earlier in the game."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce:
"It's disappointing as I didn't think we deserved to lose. We had a great chance in the first half and unfortunately in the three games we've had, we've missed those and it reappears week after week.
"When you come to Reading, they're going to have possession and they're very decent at keeping it. As for the first two big chances in the first half, they were ours.
"The first goal is an awful deflection and a horrible goal to concede, but I was pleased with the response that we could have got something from the game late on."
