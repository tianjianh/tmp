Close to 8% of the country's population combined a rhythmic slow handclap with a roar to spur on their team to the quarter finals at the Stade de France.
Also up for the award are Den Haag, FC Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund fans.
The winners will be revealed at a ceremony in Zurich in January 2017.
Fifa says the contest was set up to recognise an outstanding fan moment or gesture, and can be awarded to any fan or fan group regardless of league level, gender or nationality.
Football's world governing body says "Icelandic players leading superbly choreographed fan chants became one of the iconic images of UEFA Euro 2016".
Fans of Den Haag were selected for showering children from Rotterdam's Sophia Children's Hospital who were in the stand below them with soft toys.
And supporters of Liverpool FC and those of Borussia Dortmund won their joint nomination for singing Liverpool's anthem "You'll never walk alone" together, to mark the 27th  anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, when 96 fans were crushed to death at a Liverpool game in 1989.
Fifa says the nominees were chosen by an expert panel.
But the winner will be picked by the public: you can vote here until 9 January.
