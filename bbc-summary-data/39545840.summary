[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The teenager was walking in Brodick Street, near Glenconner Park in Royston, at about 21:25 on Saturday when he was assaulted by an unknown suspect or suspects.
He was taken by ambulance to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he was treated before being released.
Detectives said the attack appeared to be "totally unprovoked".
Det Con Martin Smith, of Maryhill CID, said: "We believe that there was a large-scale disturbance in Royston Road prior to the assault taking place and that the area would have been busy with pedestrians and passing motorists.
"As such, I'd like to speak to anyone who witnessed either the assault or disturbance."
He said door-to-door inquiries were being carried out and CCTV footage was being checked to establish the full circumstances of the incident.
