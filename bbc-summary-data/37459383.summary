[SN]TITLE[SN]
Notts County A-A Morecambe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Notts County's game with Morecambe had to be abandoned at 0-0 just 10 minutes after kick-off after a huge storm waterlogged the Meadow Lane pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The game had promised to be an entertaining one with the Magpies' Stanley Aborah letting fly from distance and forcing a corner early on.
Following that set-piece, County's Haydn Hollis forced a superb save from Barry Roche before Aborah struck another effort just wide.
But with the players struggling to move the ball as the rain came down, that was enough for referee Dean Whitestone to bring play to a halt after consulting both managers.
