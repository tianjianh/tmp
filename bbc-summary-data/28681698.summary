Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Peterborough United striker Britt Assombalonga for a club-record fee of about £5.5m.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old has signed a five-year contract after passing a medical.
He scored 33 goals in 58 games for Posh last season and had attracted interest from Premier League clubs.
The deal eclipses the £4.5m Forest paid for Pierre van Hooijdonk in 1997, two months after director of football Barry Fry said Assombalonga was not for sale.
The former Watford striker, who was born in what is now DR Congo, had spells on loan with Braintree and Southend, before Posh paid a club-record fee of £1.5m to bring him to London Road in July 2013.
He finished as League One's joint-top scorer, as the club reached the end-of-season play-offs and won the Football League Trophy.
