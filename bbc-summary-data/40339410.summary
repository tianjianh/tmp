Wales international Evans, 24, came through Wire's youth system and has played 105 times since his 2010 debut.
"He plays the game tough, is quick, he has an eye for an opportunity and the ability to finish those opportunities," said head coach Neil Jukes.
Rawsthorne, 21, is available for Thursday's game against Widnes
The centre and wing moved to the Black and Whites from Halifax and the start of the season and has spent time at York and Doncaster on loan already this campaign.
"He has a phenomenal strike rate and will ease the pressure on the whole back line," added Jukes.
Meanwhile, forward Dayne Weston is to retire after two farewell appearances because of ankle problems.
The 30-year-old had intended to quit at the end of the season but has brought it forward because he needs surgery, and will play his final game against Catalans Dragons on 1 July.
"We have tried to manage this injury for a few months now but given the hard grounds and the extensive rehab being undertaken the operation is imminent," said Jukes.
"It's been a tough few days for Dayne as the dawning realisation comes that his playing career is almost over, but he has dealt with it as a true professional."
