A burst water main flooded houses in a West Lothian town and left other areas with no water supply.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The water main in Meikle Inch Lane, in the Wester Inch estate in Bathgate, blew at about 08:20.
Witnesses said at the height of the incident there were "rivers of water".
Leyland Road and Meikle Inch Lane in the town reopened after being closed for seven hours following the "extensive flooding" which affected 17 properties.
Five nursery schools in the area were closed for afternoon children.
Scottish Water said it had found the hole in the water main and was diverting water from other pipes to Bathgate, Blackburn and Livingston, which had lost their supply earlier.
Mark McEwen, Scottish Water's customer service general manager, said: "We fully appreciate that the flooding has affected a number of properties in the area and we are doing everything we can to help with the clean-up of customers' property
"We are taking all necessary action and providing any support that is required to these customers and we will continue to do so.
"We apologise for the inconvenience caused and thank affected customers for their patience and understanding."
Firefighters diverted the floodwater into a nearby river. Specialist water rescue crews were deployed and sand bags were used to protect properties.
