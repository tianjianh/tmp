Oxford University's debating society has released a mash-up video of past speakers reciting Taylor Swift's Shake it Off in an effort to lure her to the city to give a talk.

Guests including Stephen Fry, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, actor Sir Ian McKellen, and activist Malala Yousafzai appear in the Oxford Union video.
Charles Vaughan, union president, said Swift "really defines modern pop".
The song was a worldwide hit for the US singer in August 2014.
It was taken from the album 1989, which was the year's best-selling album globally.
Other members of the video's eclectic cast include Gangnam Style singer Psy, TV presenter Piers Morgan, actors Morgan Freeman, Diane Kruger, Sir Patrick Stewart and Jack Gleeson, as well as biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins.
The video, which took a week to edit, was originally envisaged to showcase the union to new students.
Mr Vaughan said when members realised they had "quite a good product" they wanted to employ it to entice the singer to Oxford.
He added: "She's an international cultural icon.
"It's amazing when you take some famous people who are known for being celebritiesâ€¦ they have amazing things to say despite the fact that they're better known not for their academic content.
"She's a wonderful person to listen to.
"Whenever we have a speaker we try to work with them to make sure we talk about an issue which is close to their hearts.
"If Taylor - fingers crossed - actually accepts the invitation, then we can have that conversation."
The union was founded as a forum for discussion and debate in 1823.
One of its early presidents was W.E. Gladstone, who went on to become prime minister.
