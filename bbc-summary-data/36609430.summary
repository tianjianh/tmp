Offal lorry crash causes delays on M40

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry carrying frozen offal caused miles of tailbacks in both directions when it overturned on the M40 in Oxfordshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The articulated lorry crashed through the central reservation near junction 6 in south Oxfordshire, partially blocking both carriageways.
The driver was taken to hospital with a suspected ankle injury.
The northbound carriageway was later closed to allow the lorry to be recovered.
The southbound carriageway was completely blocked immediately after the crash, which happened between junctions 6 and 7, near Watlington at about 12:30 BST.
Congestion stretched back to junction 9, Bicester, and to junction 5, Stokenchurch.
