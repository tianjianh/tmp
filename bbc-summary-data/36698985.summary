Frenchman Pierre Le Corre came third.
The win extends the British brothers' domination of the Swedish event - the pair now have two wins each from five hostings.
Alistair will defend his Olympic title at Rio 2016 next month, with Jonny hoping to improve upon the bronze medal he won at London 2012.
The Brownlees' success in Stockholm is the sixth time they have finished first and second in World Triathlon Series events, the most recent being in Leeds last month.
Fellow Briton Adam Bowden finished 10th.
