Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea took another step towards clinching the Premier League title after a goalless draw at Arsenal ensured they remain 10 points clear at the top of the league.

Jose Mourhino's side will clinch the title if they follow victory at revitalised Leicester City on Wednesday with three points against Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge next Sunday.
Arsenal's fans vented their frustration with chants of "boring boring Chelsea" at the final whistle after the Gunners failed to make the most of their second-half chances, but this was the performance of a side fixing a steely gaze and determination on the title.

The criticism fell on deaf ears as Chelsea's players celebrated earning a vital draw - especially captain John Terry as he gave triumphant clenched fist salutes before taking the acclaim of the visiting supporters.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will have been as frustrated as his team's fans, having now gone 13 games without a win against his old adversary Mourinho. The Gunners had plenty of possession but could not find the inspiration to alter that grim statistic.
Chelsea mounted a defensive rearguard action after the break with Per Mertesacker and substitute Danny Welbeck missing from the rare opportunities that fell Arsenal's way.
It was not all one way, however, and Chelsea complained bitterly about three first-half penalty claims that were ignored by referee Michael Oliver, twice for incidents involving Oscar and the other on returning former Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas.
Ultimately, though, Mourinho and Chelsea will regard this as another precious point on what now seems the formality of the first title triumph of his second spell in charge at the club.

Mourinho's decision to operate without a recognised striker after injuries to Diego Costa and Loic Remy did not prevent Chelsea getting players into the Arsenal area - and he was left bemused as those penalty appeals went unanswered.
Referee Oliver did not penalise Hector Bellerin when Oscar fell under his challenge and the same player was involved again when he was cleaned out by Arsenal keeper David Ospina as they challenged for Fabregas's pass.
Oscar was left prone and required lengthy treatment amid much animation from the Chelsea bench, who were left nursing a sense of injustice once more.
The third claim came when Fabregas fell theatrically to the floor after coming into contact with Santi Cazorla. The only outcome, much to the delight of Arsenal's fans, was their former idol being shown a yellow card for diving.
Amid this chaos, chances were at a premium but Ospina came to Arsenal's rescue with a fine low save from Ramires after he ran on to Willian's pass.
Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois remained untroubled apart from one routine save from Mesut Ozil.
Mourinho made a change at half-time, sending on Didier Drogba for Oscar, who may well have been feeling the after-effects of that collision with Ospina.
Arsenal had a rare opening when Courtois could only half-clear a free-kick but the loose ball did not fall to the ideal person, giant defender Mertesacker screwing a finish well wide.
Welbeck then scuffed a clear chance in front of goal in stoppage time as Arsenal did most of the second half pressing - and Chelsea held out to leave their supporters celebrating a vital point.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:
"In the first half we had the right intensity. We dropped that in the second half and came back into the right level for the last 20 minutes.
"We could have finished the game off. Mesut Ozil had a great chance in the final minute of the game.
"But they came to defend well, and they did that well, and everybody knows that."
