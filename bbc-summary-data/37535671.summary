Boat passengers stuck on Falkirk Wheel

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Passengers were led to safety from the Falkirk Wheel after it became stuck for about 30 minutes on Sunday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 81 people were on a boat which was unable to leave the structure's upper gondola when a hydraulic gate failed to open.
Scottish Canals said those affected were either given refunds or booked onto a later sailing.
The wheel is a rotating boat lift which links the Forth & Clyde Canal to the Union Canal 35m (115ft) above.
It is Scotland's busiest tourist attraction outside a city centre.
The wheel opened as part of the Millennium Link, an Â£84.5m project that restored Scotland's inland waterways to a navigable state for the first time since the 1960s.
A Â£1m programme to revamp visitor attractions at the wheel was announced in March.
