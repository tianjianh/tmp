David Bowie propelled himself to international superstardom with his epic theatrical Ziggy Stardust tour, which took in the UK, the US and Japan, with approaching 200 shows over 18 gruelling months from January 1972.
At the tour's climax in July 1973 at London's Hammersmith Odeon Bowie announced that "this is the last show we'll ever do" to the astonishment of devoted fans.
While Stardust was no more, Bowie's limitless capacity for genre-hopping and self-reinvention was just beginning, and his appetite for touring in each of his many guises continued unabated - with periodic pauses - until nearly the turn of the millennium.
The Heathen tour of 2002 was comparatively modest in scale by Bowie's standards, but still included four transatlantic trips, while the A Reality tour from 2003 to 2004 was his biggest since Ziggy Stardust.
It would also prove to be his last.
