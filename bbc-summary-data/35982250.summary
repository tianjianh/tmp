Other policy commitments include reducing class sizes; repealing the Named Persons Act and allowing pubs to set up smoking rooms.
The party is fielding 26 candidates in the regional lists on 5 May.
The 32-page manifesto was officially launched by UKIP leader Nigel Farage in Edinburgh.
The party - whose key aim is for the UK to withdraw from the European Union - said it believed that the current higher rate of income tax was now "out of date" and should not be levied on "middle-income earners such as school teachers and senior nurses".
Its manifesto said: "As soon as the budgetary implications of devolving income tax become apparent we will propose the introduction of a new intermediate tax rate of 30% on income tax ranging between £45,300 and £55,000.
"The higher rate of 40% will begin at the threshold of £55,000."
The party added that its long-term aspiration was to create an income tax structure of a basic rate of 20%; an intermediate rate of 30%, and a top rate of 40%.

He added: "Ironically we are the only party fighting for Scotland to have more devolved issues, because it is only by leaving the European Union that Holyrood will take control of Scottish fishing and Scottish agriculture, being perhaps the first two clearest examples.
"So we are the independence party in Scotland.
"If you believe in an independent United Kingdom where Scotland has growing autonomous powers, if you believe in the independence of the individual from an over-wieldy state, then put people like Coburn [candidate David Coburn] in Holyrood."
