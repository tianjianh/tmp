[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bury 1-0 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bury dragged fellow strugglers Swindon into the League One relegation zone after claiming a home win against the Robins.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Vaughan's 37th-minute penalty was enough to win a cagey contest and send the Shakers above Swindon, although Bury remain in the bottom four too.
Given their league position, each side adopted a defensive approach so clear-cut chances were at a premium, with Bury's Reece Brown firing an early free-kick wide before Swindon's Ben Gladwin headed over.
Greg Leigh and Tom Pope then went close for the hosts before Raphael Rossi Branco was penalised for holding Pope from a corner and Vaughan smashed the spot-kick down the middle for his 18th goal of the season.
Swindon replied with Gladwin's long-range strike clipping the crossbar before Fankaty Dabo and Jermaine Hylton went close either side of the break.
Vaughan then fired over from Jacob Mellis' throughball while substitute Andrew Tutte volleyed wide.
Swindon threatened with sub Jonathan Obika and Gladwin firing straight at Joe Murphy from 20 yards.
Vaughan and Tutte were then off target again and they were almost made to pay as Charlie Colkett fired wide in stoppage time.
