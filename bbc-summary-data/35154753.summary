[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 0-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ipswich cemented their position in the play-off places as Brighton failed to win for a fifth successive match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daryl Murphy gave Ipswich the lead as the Irishman pounced on Lewis Dunk's mistake and fired in off the post for his first goal since 28 November.
Brighton's Jamie Murphy had an effort disallowed just before the goal, while Town's Kevin Bru twice hit the woodwork in the first half.
Substitute Bobby Zamora hit the bar for Albion in the second period.
The win took Ipswich four points clear of seventh-placed Sheffield Wednesday, while long-time Championship leaders Brighton are fourth, five points behind leaders Middlesbrough.
Ipswich showed their attacking intent early on as Bru hit the bar with a long-range effort after 15 minutes, while Brighton's Murphy was denied by an offside flag after Dean Gerken had saved Dale Stephens' close-range effort.
Ipswich went ahead soon afterwards as Dunk was caught in possession, allowing Daryl Murphy to score from a tight angle, and Town could have doubled their lead when Bru hit the post before half-time.
Brighton brought on Zamora and fellow striker James Wilson in a bid to find the net, but Chris Hughton's side have now gone three league games without a goal.
Zamora came closest to equalising but his effort from Bruno's cross cannoned off the crossbar.

"We are going through a difficult period. We are finding it hard.
"We've hit a few problems and have generally worked around it, but we need to show we're good enough to get through this.
"The injuries have made it difficult, yes, but we don't want to use it as an excuse. Middlesbrough were a good side when they came here, but we should have got something tonight."
Ipswich Town manager Mick McCarthy:
"I thought we had an opportunity. Brighton have lost a few players and we were playing them at a good time because we have been playing well.
"I thought we were the better team to be honest. Our keeper Dean Gerken didn't make a lot of saves. We had the better chances, whereas Brighton had the ball percentage.
"It's tough to get a run of away wins and we've got Burnley on Saturday - a tough ask, but we'll see.
"It's not realistic for us to catch Middlesbrough and Derby and I don't think automatic promotion is realistic. But we will be trying like hell to catch them."
