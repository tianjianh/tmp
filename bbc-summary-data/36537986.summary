Euro 2016: Teaching guide produced for school pupils

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is surely the stuff of dreams for schoolchildren - scrapping the traditional lesson plans and replacing them with Euro 2016-themed ones.

Now, it can be a reality after two teachers and the FAW Trust compiled an education pack.
It covers years 3-6, includes literacy, numeracy and physical education and is available for teachers to download.
CEO of the FAW Trust, Neil Ward, said: "We were really keen to use football and the Euros in engaging pupils."
The education pack, containing 24 lesson plans, was written by Adam Raymond and Jonathan Davies, assistant head teacher and physical literacy teacher respectively at Pencoed Primary School, Bridgend.
They cover the new six areas of education proposed in the review of education in Wales carried out by Prof Graham Donaldson.
Mr Raymond said: "The resource is bespoke package of planned, rich learning tasks that teachers can use and adapt to fit their pupils' needs."
Tasks include using iMovie to create a motivational film, creating a budget, writing a report on the history of Paris' buildings, cultural diversity and tourist attractions and making a graph based on statistics of Wales players' performances.
The plans have been uploaded to the Welsh Government's hub for digital learning tools and resources.
Mr Ward added: "Wales' presence in the Euros provides us with this huge, unprecedented, not to be missed opportunity to inspire young children to play. We have the potential to impact on more than 5,000 classrooms."
