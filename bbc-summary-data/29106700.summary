[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Protests have taken place at railway stations after peak evening fares started to take effect on several rail routes in the north of England.

The change, affecting services run by Northern Rail, means some weekday tickets will go up in price by 117%.
The company said off-peak tickets would no longer be valid on several routes in Greater Manchester and Yorkshire between 16:01 and 18:29.
RMT union said the hike was a "kick in the teeth for the travelling public".
The move will also affect the Newcastle to Hexham line and some routes to Derbyshire and Cheshire, the company added.
Northern Rail said changes were being made because the Department for Transport (DfT) asked them to "generate additional revenue" as part of its franchise agreement.
Additional affected routes
The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) said the move meant the cost of a Wigan to Manchester Piccadilly return ticket had risen from £4.20 to £9.10 (up 117%).
A return ticket from Bradford to Leeds return goes up from £4.60 to £6.50 (up 28.3%).
Protests were held at stations including Manchester Victoria, Manchester Piccadilly, Sheffield and Liverpool Lime Street.
A Department for Transport spokesman said the changes would help build a "rail network that is better for the passenger and better value for the taxpayer".
He said: "Such restrictions are relatively common on other parts of the network, including in the Merseytravel area, and we expect only a minority of passengers to be affected."
Martin Abrams, from CBT, said: "This fare increase threatens to make rail travel unaffordable to tens of thousands of part-time workers.
"Despite government promises, there are no flexible tickets for the increasing numbers who work part-time or anything other than traditional nine-to-five hours.
"Their only option is to pay for individual tickets, which will now be double the price on Northern Rail's most popular routes."
On Sunday, the Chancellor George Osborne said commuter rail fares in England would be frozen in real terms for another year.
Regulated fares, which include season tickets and "anytime" singles, will rise by a maximum of 2.5% from January.
