The 22-year-old, who scored in the FA Cup third-round draw against Liverpool in January, was out of contract at the League Two club in the summer.
Nichols came through the Grecians' youth ranks and scored 34 goals in 113 appearances for Exeter.
He becomes Graham Westley's side's sixth signing of the January transfer window.
"We have been trying to sign Tom since January 2015 when we first approached Exeter about a deal so it's been a long chase for his services," said Posh chairman Darragh MacAnthony.
Meanwhile, another Exeter forward - David Wheeler - has extended his contract with the Devon club.
