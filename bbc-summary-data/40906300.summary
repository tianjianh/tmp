The substitute's glancing header came after Kirsty Hanson slotted in the opener early in the second half.
It leaves both sides with one point - and both need to win their final Group A games on Monday to have any chance of making the semi-finals.
Germany beat Spain 2-0 while England lost out 2-0 to the Netherlands.
It leaves England with one win from two Group B matches going into Monday's encounter against France, who hammered Italy 6-1.
It was an entertaining match at a sunny Mourneview Park with the Scots carving out the best chances in the first half.
Hanson beat two defenders before blazing just over before NI keeper Lauren Perry superbly tipped a powerful shot from Claire Adams onto the bar.
Amy Gallacher screwed her shot wide of the NI goal while at the other end Brenna McPartlan fired straight at keeper Rebecca Flaherty.
Scotland took the lead seconds after the restart with Hanson latching on to Gallacher's through ball before sliding it past the advancing Perry.
Northern Ireland wasted a good chance to equalise when Leyla McFarland was clear eight yards out only to scoop her shot straight at Flaherty.
McDaniel made no mistake with her late leveller, meeting Megan Reilly's corner at the near-post and directing the ball past Flaherty.
It meant a deserved first point of the competition for the teams but they face a tough task to progress to the semi-finals with Germany on six points and Spain three.
Northern Ireland take on the Germans, who have already qualified for the semis, in Ballymena on Monday evening while the Scots face Spain in Lurgan.
