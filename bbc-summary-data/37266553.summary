The striker pulled up with a hamstring injury during the opening league match of the season and has missed the last four games.
The 26-year-old had netted five goals in his first four matches.
"He will join us for a full week of training so he'll be involved in some capacity in the 18 to face Celtic," manager Mark Warburton told Rangers TV.
"It's good to welcome Waggy back, he has a great goalscoring record and so much more that he brings to the team.
"But it's about using the squad and having complete faith and belief in the squad, which we do, and having options to choose from."
Waghorn scored 28 goals in his debut season at Ibrox, helping Rangers win promotion to the top flight.

The former Wigan forward featured for the last half hour of Saturday's 7-0 friendly win over Linfield in Belfast, with Kenny Miller finding the net four times and new defender Philippe Senderos playing for 56 minutes.
Midfielder Andy Halliday started at left-back in the absence of the injured Lee Wallace, who pulled out of the Scotland squad on Friday with a muscle strain.
