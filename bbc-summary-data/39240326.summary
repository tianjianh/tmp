Noble doubled the lead with a penalty after Martin Riley fouled Kaiyne Woolery.
Christian Doidge sealed victory with his 21st goal of the season.
Rovers stay second in the table with Lincoln, in FA Trophy semi-final action, remaining leaders on goal difference having played three games less than Mark Cooper's side.
Wrexham remain 10th despite suffering their second successive defeat.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales; "Performance wise it wasn't good enough and result wise it was disappointing.
"For the first 40 minutes we played a decent enough shape to frustrate them and the first goal on the stroke of half time is massive and gives them a lift.
"They're a good team and hence the reason why they are chasing the top place."
