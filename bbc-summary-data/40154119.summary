The London 2012 gold medallist, 30, jumped 7.95m in the third round in Gavardo - a meeting record - to beat Italy's Camillo Kabore (7.45m).
But Rutherford later tweeted: "Sadly not to be today. The ankle injury I've been dealing with hasn't held up.
"I think a hospital trip is in order for scans and treatment."
Rutherford won the Great City Games last weekend in Manchester as he recorded 8.18m with his final jump.
He is targeting a successful defence of his title at the World Athletics Championships in London in August, before defending his Commonwealth and European crowns in 2018.
