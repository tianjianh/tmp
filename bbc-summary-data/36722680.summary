Ireland's Fernandez played the first foul shot of a World Championship qualifier against Gary Wilson in April.
The foul enabled other people to profit by betting on it, a World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association investigation found.
Fernandez, 40, had recently secured a professional tour place for the first time since 2008.
His ban runs until 27 August, 2017.
Fernandez will also pay Â£2,000 costs to the WPBSA, the sport's governing body, and has agreed to help with the organisation's anti-corruption education work.
WPBSA chairman Jason Ferguson said: "Leo Fernandez had just qualified to play on the WSL tour this season as a full professional and by his actions he has thrown away this opportunity.
"This demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that all aspects of matches in World Snooker events are competed in a fair and honest manner."
