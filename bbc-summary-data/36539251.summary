Bradford City: Stuart McCall poised for return as manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stuart McCall has agreed a deal in principle to begin a second spell as Bradford City manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 52-year-old left Rangers last year after they missed out on promotion from the Scottish Championship.
His appointment, which could be confirmed this weekend, would result in him giving up his role as number three to Gordon Strachan with Scotland.
The former Bantams player would take over from Phil Parkinson, who has moved to relegated Bolton Wanderers.
McCall, who was in charge of Bradford from 2007 to 2010, will be in opposition to Parkinson's side in League One next season should he be confirmed as manager.
The former Everton, Rangers and Sheffield United midfielder was manager of Motherwell in Scotland's top flight for four years after leaving Bradford in 2010.
He took over as Rangers manager on a short-term basis in March 2015 after the departure of Kenny McDowall.
McCall had hoped to continue in the role despite the Glasgow club facing another season outside of the Scottish Premiership, but the Ibrox outfit instead appointed Mark Warburton.
With Scotland, McCall and current Motherwell boss Mark McGhee have assisted Strachan.
