The lots included a telex from President Dwight D. Eisenhower announcing the German surrender on 7 May 1945.
A cipher message of the ceasefire order and a final intelligence report stating  "there is no longer an enemy to defeat" were also sold.
Auctioneer Richard Davie said it had been "very successful".
Eisenhower's first message to his command after the surrender, along with a photograph of Major General Kenneth Strong, fetched £5,145 ($8,000), at the sale, held in Nottingham at the weekend.
The document was the first official word millions of troops would have received that the war was over.
The cipher message detailing the ceasefire order sold for £3,430 ($5,334) and the final intelligence report went for £2.695 ($4,191).
The 70th anniversary of VE Day - the day Eisenhower's total ceasefire order ended the war in Europe - was marked in May this year.
These items, along with four other documents related to VE Day sold for more than £18,680 ($29,083) at International Autograph Auctions.
