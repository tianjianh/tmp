Labour's number one target seat in the West Midlands has been held by the Conservatives with an increased majority.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
New MP Craig Tracey won Warwickshire North with a majority of 2,973, a swing of 3% from Labour. The Tories were defending a majority of just 54 votes.
Labour's Mike O'Brien came second, polling 17,069 votes, with UKIP in third place, winning 8,256 votes.
The Tories also held the key marginal Nuneaton, with an increased majority.
Sitting MP Marcus Jones was re-elected in Nuneaton with a majority of 4,882, an increase of 2,813 from the last general election.
Mr Jones said the voters in Nuneaton had "spoken for Britain".
Polling experts were predicting a swing to Labour, but their candidate Vicky Fowler came second with 15,945 votes.
Labour held the seat from 1992 until 2010.
UKIP's Alwyn Waine polled 6,582 votes to take third place.
Mr Tracey said: "I always felt that we'd win but the majority has surprised me but it's testament to the work that we've done campaigning."
Mr O'Brien said he was "somewhat surprised" about the result "but the people will make their choice and they've done so".
When it comes to writing the history of the 2015 General Election the name of Nuneaton will loom large.
Marcus Jones held the seat for the Conservatives, doubling his majority, in a seat Labour simply had to win if they were to have any hope of victory.
The BBC exit poll suggested a bad night for Labour and this was confirmation the party was underperforming in a key seat.
Approaching the microphone for his victory speech, Mr Jones simply said: "Wow!"
His reaction spoke volumes about the significance of the result.
The news got worse for Labour shortly afterwards when the party failed to overturn a Conservative majority of just 54 in Warwickshire North - the seat was Ed Miliband's top UK target.
Laura Kuenssberg, chief correspondent for Newsnight, said: "Worryingly for Labour, the increase in the majority gives more weight to the possibility that the Conservatives could win an outright majority."
There was an increase of 11,530 in the Conservatives' majority as they held the Stratford-on-Avon seat.
Labour held Coventry South, Coventry North West and Coventry North East.
