Lancaster Farms: 'Safe' prison but work needed on reoffending

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Lancashire prison has been praised in an inspector's report, but further work is needed to help reduce reoffending.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An unannounced inspection found Lancaster Farms to be "safe and decent" with support for vulnerable prisoners.
But the risk assessments of inmates before their release was "seriously flawed", the report said.
The Chief Inspector of Prisons report is the first since the former young offenders' institution became a category C adult prison.
It also noted living conditions were good and praised the work to reintegrate prisoners into the community.
Concerns were raised about the needs of some disabled prisoners not being met and work with foreign nationals was described as "poor".
The report also questioned public protection arrangements which consist of assessments to monitor the progress of inmates while in prison.
These were described as "seriously flawed" and requiring "urgent attention", the report said.
Nick Hardwick, Chief Inspector of Prisons, said: "We felt that good progress had been made in providing a safe and decent prison for the new population held, but that consistent management attention was needed to address weakness in the amount and range of work offered, and in the support provided around the critical areas of offender management and public protection.
"It was reassuring that senior managers had recognised most of these weaknesses and had credible plans to address the shortfalls."
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said: "We accept that there is more work to do to develop the resettlement regime and provision of purposeful activity for the new adult population and will use the recommendations to drive progress in these areas over the coming months."
