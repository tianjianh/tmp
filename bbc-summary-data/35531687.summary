The 31-year-old has made 160 appearances for Sale since joining the club from Saracens in 2009.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the club and was delighted to be offered a new deal," he said.
Seymour is the third Sale player to commit his future to the club recently, with winger Will Addison and centre Mark Jennings also signing new deals.
"He is one of the senior professionals at the club and is well respected by the whole squad," director of rugby Steve Diamond added,
"David wants to help us continue our journey and wants to enjoy success at the club."
