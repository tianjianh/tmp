Sgt Louise Lucas, 41, was airlifted to hospital but later died. Her daughter Olivia, eight, was also injured in the incident on The Kingsway on 31 March.
Her family described her as "an outgoing, hard working and loving person."
A coroner has called on Swansea council to address safety concerns on the road.
In a tribute they wrote: "Our family is absolutely devastated at the tragic accident, which took Louise from us all last week.
"We've lost a beautiful loving wife, mum, daughter and sister who will never be forgotten.
"Louise was an outgoing, hard working and loving person. An incredible hole has been left in our family which can never be filled."
The family thanked staff at Swansea's Morriston hospital who treated the mother-of-three and her daughter.
They also paid tribute to police, members of the public and staff from the Principality building society who looked after Olivia after the incident.
After the crash, Swansea council said it would install temporary barriers along the central reservation of the road.
It has already dropped the speed limit to 20mph following concerns from residents that the road was unsafe.
In a letter to the council, Swansea's acting senior coroner Colin Phillips said the road had a "serious design issue", which "must be addressed".
Mr Phillips issued the report as part of his investigation into the death of Daniel Foss, 37, who died after being hit by a bus on The Kingsway in September 2013.
