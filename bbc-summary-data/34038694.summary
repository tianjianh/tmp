The event will happen a week after a Hawker Hunter jet crashed onto a road at the Shoreham Air Show in Sussex, leaving at least 11 people dead.
Rhyl's flight director said the majority of the show would take place over the sea, providing a "natural safety margin" for spectators.
The event runs on 29 and 30 August.
Director Mike Wood said: "The only item with any element flying over the crowd will be the Red Arrows, who have received special permission from the Ministry of Defence and Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
"For this, they will be flying high, straight and level in a stable formation.
"We are also keeping abreast of the post incident investigations at Shoreham and we will obviously be ready to implement any immediate changes to regulations should they be needed."
Denbighshire council said it had received guidance from the CAA after the "shocking and tragic events" at Shoreham, adding safety would be a top priority.
