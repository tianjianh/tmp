The Lionesses held a deserved half-time lead after Toni Duggan's flicked header from Alex Greenwood's right-wing cross.
Germany levelled when England defender Gilly Flaherty unluckily diverted a low cross past keeper Karen Bardsley.
The European champions nicked a barely-deserved win when Babett Peter coolly tucked in a controversial penalty.
England's second straight defeat at the new international tournament, which features four of the best five ranked teams in the world, ended their hopes of an unlikely triumph.
A narrow 1-0 defeat in their opener against hosts United States, the current world champions, left them with a difficult task to win the round-robin group competition.
But the World Cup bronze medallists looked set to keep their hopes alive as they led Germany until the 76th minute.
With most of the English players still in pre-season mode before the summer Women's Super League season, Germany's superior match fitness began to tell in the final stages.
However, that had little effect on the two slices of misfortune that took the game away from Mark Sampson's team.
England recorded their first win over Germany - at the 21st attempt - in last summer's World Cup third-place play-off, then followed it up with a hard-fought 0-0 draw in Duisburg in November.

The Lionesses again showed they could compete for long periods against Germany, but they were undone by the decision to wrongly penalise Fara Williams, who was making her 150th international appearance.
Williams, who scored the winning penalty against Germany in the World Cup, appeared to win the ball from forward Alexandra Popp, who fell after kicking the England midfielder's foot.
"It is incredibly tough to take," Sampson told BBC Sport.
"Two games in a row we have stonewall penalties not given to us and a ridiculous penalty given against us. The officials aren't good enough.
"It is frustrating because there were lots of good things in that game for us but we haven't quite got over the line. The decision cost us."
