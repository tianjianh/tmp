A bomb disposal squad was called in to sweep the home of one of the suspects, in the central city of Clermont-Ferrand, French media say.
The other two arrests were reportedly in Marseille and in the Paris region.
France is on high alert after a series of deadly attacks in recent years by militants claiming to be from the Islamic State group.
Few details of Tuesday's arrests are yet known.

Another police source quoted in Le Monde said the plot was sufficiently advanced that the French intelligence agency, the DGSI, decided to intervene.
