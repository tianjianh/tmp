Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland has instructed his colleagues to use the full range of their powers to crack down of fraud.
He said the move was needed to protect the interests of legitimate businesses and their employees.
Ticket touts and those selling counterfeit goods are to be targeted.
Mr Mulholland said: "I have no doubt the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow will be the greatest ever held. Legitimate businesses in Scotland and their staff who have worked hard to make the games a success rightly stand to reap huge benefits.
"Anyone who thinks they can make an easy fast buck from the Games by committing fraud whether it is ticket touting or counterfeiting should be aware that prosecutors have a range of powerful laws to ensure that can't happen."
Mr Mulholland added: " Anyone who attempts to disrupt the Games by operating con schemes or committing public disorder crimes should also be aware that the lowest level they will be prosecuted at is the Sheriff Court, where they could face sentences of up to five years in jail and an unlimited fine."
He also revealed that those found guilty of crimes such as counterfeiting and ticket touting can also be prosecuted using proceeds of crime legislation because they are deemed to be "lifestyle offences".
The announcement has been welcomed by the Scottish Business Resilience Centre (SBRC).
SBRC Director Mandy Haeburn-Little said: "Counterfeit goods damage the economy. They are bad for the buyer and they harm the community in a whole range of ways.
"Not only is the quality often extremely poor but at worst items can be dangerous and, sadly, often produced in the shadow economy."
She added: "We all want to see Scotland as a safe, attractive and fun place to be during the Commonwealth Games and beyond and we all want residents and visitors to enjoy the very best quality that Scotland has to offer."
