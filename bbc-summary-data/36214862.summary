Inverness Caledonian Thistle keen to bring back Billy Mckay

Inverness Caledonian Thistle would be negligent not to look at the possibility of re-signing Billy Mckay, according to assistant boss Brian Rice.

The 27-year-old Northern Ireland striker is currently on loan with relegated Dundee United after failing to make an impact with Wigan Athletic.
He left Caley Thistle in January 2015 and his former club are keen to improve their goal threat next season.
"We would be stupid not to look at someone of his pedigree," said Rice.
"I don't think he's had the best of times at Dundee United, through no fault of his own, but he was magnificent for this club and sometimes you find a club fits you.
"You find yourself at home, things come easier."
Mckay, who started his career with Leicester City, scored 62 goals in four years with Caley Thistle after leaving Northampton Town in 2011.
The Highlands outfit have struggled to find a similar goalscorer since he was transferred to Wigan in January 2015 for an undisclosed fee.
However, after 11 goalless outings for the Latics, he switched to United last August on loan, scoring 13 goals in 33 appearances despite them spending all season at the bottom of the Premiership.
"It's definitely one we would like to look at and I'm sure everyone at the club - the management, the players, the board, the fans - would all like to see Billy back here," added Rice.
"As much as we would like Billy back here, I don't know if Billy would like to come back here."
