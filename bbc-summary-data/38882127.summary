They will examine the area around the North Ayrshire route for about 10 weeks.
Further works, including fencing and vegetation clearance, are also due to begin in the coming weeks.
Transport Scotland said it was committed to ensuring archaeological assessments were undertaken before main construction works started.
"The archaeological works on the A737 Dalry bypass will start with around 10 archaeologists on site, with a further five people providing support and supervision," a spokesperson said.
"They will conduct a historic building survey, topographical surveys and photographic surveys, as well as evaluation trenching.
"Over the coming months, a report will be prepared and made available via the project website.
"We would also like to take the opportunity to inform the local community that the site of the A737 Dalry Bypass is now a construction site and that the only way they can ensure their own safety is to avoid the area."
The A737 Dalry bypass project involves the construction of a new bypass to the east of Dalry and its associated junctions to connect with the existing A737 road.
It is designed to "encourage improved economic and employment opportunities through better journey time reliability".
The bypass will also separate long-distance traffic from local traffic, leading to improved safety for local road users and communities.
