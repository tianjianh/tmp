A portrait artist has been working on an unusual canvas - his pregnant wife's bump.

Alex Makwana's labour of love has seen him create 11 designs on Jo's stomach, including Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear and a mocked-up ultrasound scan.
Mr Makwana, 29, of Salisbury, said his wife of 12 days sat and watched Call The Midwife and One Born Every Minute during the four-hour painting sessions.
The baby will be the family's seventh child.
Mr Makwana said the other children "love" the paintings.
It is the second time Mr Makwana has created art on his 35-year-old wife's stomach, having done the same for their sixth child, Ava.
"Loads of people loved it last time so we've embraced it this time," he said.
He was lent the face-painting kit by Sarah Cookson, Ava's godmother.
The 11 designs include images the pair kissing at sunset - a replica of a photograph of the married couple taken at a recent wedding.
Mrs Makwana, whose baby is due in three weeks, described the process as a "bonding experience".
"It's a really lovely way to have memories of being pregnant with this baby," she said.
"It will be lovely when they are older to be able to show them the pictures and tell them the excitement which was centred around their bumps."
