[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge 2-1 Bromley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Sheppard's late wonder strike kept Dagenham second in the National League with a 2-1 win over mid-table Bromley at Victoria Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brandon Hanlan gave Bromley a seventh-minute lead when he dispossessed Daggers captain Craig Robson, raced into the box and fired a low shot home.
With the visitors dominating, Hanlan almost doubled the advantage when his shot hit the post and went wide, but Dagenham levelled with their first attempt on target, Fejiri Okenabirhie slotting into an empty net after the Ravens failed to clear.
There were few clear-cut chances after the break until the 88th minute when Sheppard smashed in from 25 yards out to stop his side from dropping a place to third in the table.
