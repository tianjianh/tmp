Brian Clough: Plea to return missing road signs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Football fans thought to have stolen road signs celebrating legendary manager Brian Clough have been asked to return them.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five of the 20 signs along Brian Clough Way - a 15-mile stretch of the A52 - have gone missing.
The road was named after Clough in 2005 as it links Nottingham and Derby, where he managed two football teams.
Clough fan Kal Singh Dhindsa pleaded for the signs to be returned, adding Cloughie would not have been happy.
Mr Singh Dhindsa , who previously campaigned for a statue of Clough and his assistant Peter Taylor at Pride Park Stadium in Derby, said the signs were part of the region's history and heritage.
"As much of a fan of Brian Clough as I am, I would never consider stealing them," he said.
"In my opinion, if you are such a big fan of Brian Clough, you should just leave them there for other people to appreciate."
"If Mr Clough was here today I think he would probably give someone a good telling off," he added.
Signs are missing from Stapleford in Nottinghamshire and Risley, Borrowash and Ockbrook (two) in Derbyshire.
Erewash Borough Council, which is responsible for four of the missing signs, said it was looking in to the matter but "at this current moment in time" had no plans to replace the signs.
Broxtowe Borough Council, which manages the other missing sign, has not yet commented.
