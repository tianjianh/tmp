Graham Ibbeson, who sculpted the Morecambe monument, will design and create a statue of Victoria Wood in Greater Manchester.
Wood's brother Chris Foote Wood set up a crowdfunding appeal for the statue having been inspired by Ibbeson's creation.
Bafta award-winning Wood died from cancer in April last year aged 62.
Mr Wood said: "I am very pleased indeed that we have been able to obtain the services of Graham Ibbeson.
"It was his statue of Eric Morecambe that first inspired me to try to get something similar for my multi-talented and much-loved sister Victoria."
Mr Ibbeson said he was honoured and delighted to be chosen adding:  "Her unique humour was a product of 'Northern roots', unpretentious, accessible, and well observed.
"I will try to mirror all these qualities in my sculpture by trying to capture the warmth of her character and personality, and also reflecting the nation's affection [and indeed mine] for her unique talent."
The monument to the Prestwich-born star will be erected in Library Gardens, Bury, on a site provided by Bury Council.
Council leader Rishi Shori, said: "Victoria visited Eric Morecambe's statue several times and admired Graham's work, so it is very fitting for him to be creating this tribute to such a talented star."
The statue of Eric Morecambe on the was unveiled by the Queen in 1999 on the resort's seafront.
