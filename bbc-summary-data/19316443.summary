The deadpan Canadian funnyman was given the prize by digital TV channel Dave, whose panel put a selection of their favourites to a public vote.
He won for the joke: "You know who really gives kids a bad name? Posh and Becks."
The British King of the one-liner, Tim Vine, took the runner-up spot for the second year in a row.
Vine, who won the award two years ago, appears twice in the list of 10 jokes compiled by the TV channel, as does Francis.
The top jokes were:
The winning joke was taken from Stewart Francis's current Edinburgh show, Return of the Lumberjacks.
The show, at The Assembly Rooms, is a reunion for Francis and other Canadian comics, Craig Campbell and Glenn Wool.
Francis, who made his Edinburgh debut 15 years ago, has made appearances on British TV shows such as Mock the Week and Live at The Apollo.
Although born in Canada, both of Stewart's parents are British and he lives in the UK full-time with his Scottish wife.
Of his win, Stewart said: "1969 West Mall Soccer Association's Most Valuable Player, and now this."
The 10 Dave judges sat through an average of 60 comedy shows.
The panel was made up of comedy critics such as Dominic Maxwell of The Times, Mark Monahan of the Daily Telegraph and Bruce Dessau of the Evening Standard.
They shortlisted 30 jokes which were then put to a public vote.
