Tour of Austria: 'Solution' found over racist abuse claim

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
African team MTN-Qhubeka say a "solution" has been reached after claiming one of their riders was racially abused at the Tour of Austria.

The team complained after Eritrean Natnael Berhane was allegedly abused by a CCC Sprandi Polkowice rider.
A statement from the Polish team read: "The rider will suffer consequences."
MTN-Qhubeka team principal Douglas Ryder called the incident "outrageous", while Sprandi Polkowice said the rider's actions were "unacceptable".
They added: "We, as a team, do not tolerate that kind of behaviour.
"In the heat of the battle some words have been said by our rider, which were very unfortunate and unacceptable."
Ryder told the BBC the incident had been dealt with "fantastically" by the sport's world governing body the UCI and that a "solution" had been agreed.
He added: "The rider feels really bad about it - I believe the solution was that he is going to donate a month's salary to the Qhubeka charity to put more African students on bicycles."
South Africa-based MTN-Qhubeka are the first African team to ride at the Tour de France. Their rider Daniel Teklehaimanot became the first black African to take the King of the Mountains jersey on Thursday's sixth stage.
