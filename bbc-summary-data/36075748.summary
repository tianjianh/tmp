Vardy, 29, remonstrated with referee Jon Moss after he was shown a red card in Sunday's 2-2 draw with West Ham.
The FA has also charged Leicester with failing to control their players after West Ham won an 83rd-minute penalty.
Vardy and Leicester have until 18:00 BST on Thursday to respond.

Vardy, the Premier League's joint leading scorer with 22 goals this season, was shown a second yellow card early in the second half for diving.
He appeared to confront Moss - who was criticised for his performance by Match of the Day pundit Alan Shearer - before leaving the field.
The England international receives an automatic one-match ban for his dismissal, but that looks likely to be increased following the FA charge.
Chelsea striker Diego Costa was given an additional one-match ban and was fined £20,000 after admitting a charge of improper conduct last month.
The 27-year-old was punished for his reaction to his sending-off against Everton in an FA Cup tie on 12 March.
Arsenal defender Gabriel was also banned for one match, and given a £10,000 fine, after admitting the same charge in September.
Premier League leaders Leicester need eight points from their final four matches to guarantee the title.
Their final four matches are against Swansea (home), Manchester United (away), Everton (home) and Chelsea (away).
