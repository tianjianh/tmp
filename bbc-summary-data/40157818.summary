The success sees Dunlop move level with Mike Hailwood as the fourth most successful solo TT rider of all time.
The Northern Ireland rider finished 13.2 seconds ahead of runner-up James Hillier in the four-lap race, with Peter Hickman third.
For Dunlop, 28, who was riding a Yamaha, it was his sixth triumph in the Supersport class and first since 2014.
The win will go some way to making up for the Ballymoney man's disappointment at his retirement from the Superbike race while leading on Sunday.
"I was disappointed yesterday and knew I had to stand up and be counted. It took me a lap or two to get bedded in but the boys have worked hard to make the bike the best it can be," said Dunlop.
JG Speedfit Kawasaki pilot Hillier led by 0.4 seconds after lap one but Dunlop moved 2.5 seconds ahead by the end of the lap two thanks to a lap of 126.015mph.
Hampshire rider Hillier was unable to respond and had to settle for the sixth second place finish of his TT career as Dunlop pulled away to extend his advantage.
Hickman, on board the Smiths Triumph, took his second podium of the week, 13 seconds adrift of Hillier, after coming in behind Ian Hutchinson in the Superbike opener.
The Lincolnshire rider set the fastest lap of the race on 126.85 on his final circuit.
William Dunlop, Hutchinson, who had won the last four Supersport TTs, and Triumph rider Gary Johnson made up the top six.
Former winner Bruce Anstey had to settle for seventh on the Padgett's Honda, while Manxmen Dan Kneen and Conor Cummins were eighth and ninth respectively.
Dean Harrison retired at Ballacraine on lap two while lying third.
Racing is scheduled to continue on Tuesday with the four-lap Superstock race at 12:15 BST.
