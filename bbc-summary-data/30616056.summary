Solar power capacity in Scotland rises by third

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's solar power capacity has increased by about a third in the past year, according to new figures.

More than 35,000 homes and 600 business premises now have solar photo-voltaic (PV) systems, December figures from regulator Ofgem show.
The capacity of these systems has reached 140 megawatts, a rise of 32% from 106 megawatts last year.
However, solar power capacity is still small compared to wind energy which has almost 40 times the installed capacity.
Green energy campaigners are calling on the Scottish government to do more to help homes and businesses harness the power of the sun.
WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "The total installed solar capacity may be small when compared to wind energy, but together these solar panels are helping to prevent thousands of tonnes of climate-damaging emissions every year.
"The great thing about solar is that it can be deployed easily and quickly in towns and cities or in places not suitable for wind turbines. Solar is also complimentary to wind and can share sites and grid connections."
