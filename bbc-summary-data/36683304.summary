The Cardiff City midfielder will lead Iceland against hosts France in Sunday's fourth quarter final in Paris.
"I don't think anyone is full," said the 27-year-old who led the celebrations with fans after Iceland's shock win over Roy Hodgson's team.
"I think we're still hungry for more and obviously we have another difficult game against France on Sunday."
Gunnarsson, who played 29 times during Cardiff's 2015-16 Championship campaign, believes his team have a real chance of more success against France.
"We said before the game that beating England would change lives and for Icelandic football in general and I think it has," he told BBC Radio Wales.
"We're getting more and more attention and the further we go it will get even better, and as long as we keep our feet on the ground and keep on progressing as a team you never know.
"If you come to a game with the right attitude and are tactically spot-on you've always got a chance - even if you are the underdogs."
Iceland were the lowest-ranked team going into Euro 2016 and the country with a population of only 323,000 - smaller than the city where Gunnarsson plays his club football.
So far they have drawn with semi-finalists Portugal and Hungary and beaten Austria and England.
France will be overwhelming favourites for Sunday's match, but Lars Lagerback's team have also beaten Netherlands away in a Euro 2016 qualifier during the past 12 months.
And Gunnarsson is happy to see the team and the fans getting recognition for their achievements.
"It has been special for football back in Iceland," he added.
"It has put us on the map even though we're have the underdogs in this tournament it's done wonders for how we are going about things and for the fans.
"We have to give credit to the fans because they've turned up in numbers and they're getting a lot of positive attention as well which is a good thing."
