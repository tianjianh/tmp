BDO world number one Glen Durrant says he will decide whether to join the PDC after January's World Championships.

The 45-year-old lost to Martin Adams in the semi-final at Lakeside last year, but recovered to beat Larry Butler in the World Masters final in October.
A number of players have switched codes in recent years including 2014 BDO world champion Stephen Bunting who is now ranked 17 in the PDC.
"Don't be surprised if I stay with the BDO," Durrant told BBC Radio Tees.
"I could go to the PDC and I could get swallowed up there because the standard is phenomenal.
"If I am working full time and I'm practicing for one hour a night or two hours a night I can't beat Michael Van Gerwen, who's practicing as we speak, or the Phil Taylors of this world.
"If I don't do it now I never will. It's a big, big decision, but I'll make that decision after Lakeside."
