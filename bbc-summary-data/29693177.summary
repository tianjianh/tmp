Jan Bevington, 67, rescued her first seal in 1987, and then established the Hillswick Wildlife Sanctuary.
And she played a key role in the wake of the Braer oil tanker running aground in 1993, which saw almost 85,000 tonnes of crude oil spill.
She received a special award from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) at the House of Lords.
Azzedine Downes, president of IFAW, said of Tuesday's award: "Jan's dedication has seen her rescue countless marine mammals over the years and she is a great example of animal welfare in action.
"She is a very deserving winner of IFAW's Marine Rescue Award."
Ms Bevington said: "I was completely taken aback when I heard about this award.
"I just do this work for the love of it - it's an honour to have been nominated and for Hillswick Wildlife Sanctuary to receive such recognition."
