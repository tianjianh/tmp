The 29-year-old, who missed the last three months of the 2015-16 season following surgery, takes over from Ed Slater as Tigers skipper.
"I am immensely proud. It is without a doubt one of the highest things I have achieved in the game," Youngs said.
Capped 22 times, he played 13 times for Tigers last season after starting for England in the 2015 World Cup.
New England head coach Eddie Jones overlooked Youngs for their triumphant Six Nations campaign before injury ruled the British and Irish Lions forward out of contention for the victorious summer tour to Australia.
