Special crews experienced in working at heights were brought in to access the displays, and used ropes and harnesses to spruce up the machines.
The museum houses the largest Cold War exhibition in the UK, including a segment of the Berlin Wall, which was also dusted.
BBC Midlands Today's Joanne Writtle went to watch the cleaners wing walk with their mops and buckets.
