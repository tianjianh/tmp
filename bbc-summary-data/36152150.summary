The Argentine, 45, appeared to instruct a ball boy to throw a ball on to the pitch to disrupt a Malaga attack during Atletico's 1-0 win on Saturday.
Simeone, who was sent to the stands at half-time, said: "It is clear the referee took the correct decision."
He will not miss Atletico's Champions League semi-final first-leg at home to Bayern Munich on Wednesday (19:45 BST).
Simeone will miss the home game against Rayo Vallecano on 30 April, the trip to Levante on 8 May and the visit of Celta Vigo on 15 May, the final day of the season.
Atletico, who are second to La Liga leaders Barcelona on goal difference, have 10 days in which to appeal.
