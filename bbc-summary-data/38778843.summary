[SN]TITLE[SN]
Coventry City 0-2 Millwall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Goals from Jake Cooper and Steve Morison helped Millwall continue their League One play-off push with a win at struggling Coventry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Millwall took the lead in the 33rd minute when Cooper bundled home a corner from close range - seconds after play was halted when Coventry fans threw tennis balls on to the pitch in protest at the club's owners.
The opening goal sparked Coventry into life following a dull opening half an hour that lacked any clear-cut chances.
The home side should have been level by half-time when Farrend Rawson put a header over the bar in the 39th minute, while Marcus Tudgay's curled effort went just over a minute later.
Millwall could have doubled their lead in the 54th minute when Lee Burge was beaten to the ball after racing out of his goal, but Morison's shot was deflected wide.
Despite Coventry's efforts to get back into the game, Morison eventually doubled Millwall's lead in the 79th minute by tapping in the rebound from Fred Onyedinma's shot.
