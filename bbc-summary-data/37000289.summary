Whitlock, who won two bronze medals in 2012, also qualified for the floor and pommel finals. Team-mate Kristian Thomas made the floor final, Louis Smith is in the pommel final and Wilson will be in the high bar final.
Wilson, the highest-placed Briton in the all-around qualification having come fifth, said: "I'm loving every second of it and that's what I focus on, enjoying myself.
"Today, all I was focusing on was my gymnastics and what I could do and what I could control.
"I had to go out there and do six routines. I had a couple of little wobbles but, all in all, very consistent and clean and come out with a great score and a couple of big scores on a couple of big apparatus."
