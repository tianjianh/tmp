A Shaun Whalley penalty and a Louis Dodds inside a minute at the start of the second half clinched the victory for the League One side.
Nathaniel Mendez-Laing's late first half strike had given the Bluebirds an interval lead.
Cardiff complete their pre-season preparation at home to Scottish outfit Livingstone, on Friday.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock told BBC Wales: "You don't look into these defeats but you look into bad habits that can come from them.
"I thought there were quite a lot of plusses tonight and a couple of negatives, especially in the second half, which I've got to remedy."
