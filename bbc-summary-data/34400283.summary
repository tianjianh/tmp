Sue Sim makes new call over Northumbria Police 'sexism'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former chief constable of Northumbria Police has claimed the force is refusing to investigate her allegations about sexism.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Before Sue Sim retired she faced accusations of misconduct and bullying, and a report criticised her management style, but cleared her of wrongdoing.
It also said Ms Sim's gender was an issue in the way she was treated.
Northumbria Police said she had not provided any basis upon which it could launch her requested investigation.
Sue Sim said: "What needs to be looked at is, is there a culture within the organisation that needs to be addressed?
"I'm not saying Northumbria Police is sexist [but] there's an independent report from a QC conducting the investigation into my behaviour, which stated that officers had behaved in a different way to me because I'm a woman.
"All I've asked the chief constable to do is look at the issues in relation to the statements within that independent report which talked about gender being an issue, and that sexism did play a part."
A Northumbria Police spokesman said: "The full report was available to Mrs Sim, as the person complained of, prior to her retirement and when she was still head of the organisation.
"She took no action in her capacity of chief constable in relation to its content.
"We are satisfied, having taken legal advice, that Mrs Sim has not provided any basis upon which we can launch the investigation she requests.
"It is disappointing that Mrs Sim has chosen to publicly air these concerns after her retirement, having led the organisation for five years."
Ms Sim retired in June and the chief constable post was taken over by Steve Ashman.
