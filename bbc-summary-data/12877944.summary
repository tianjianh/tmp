AG Barr reported pre-tax profits of Â£30.4m for the year to the end of January, up 25% on the Â£24.5m the company made a year earlier. Revenue rose by more than 10% to Â£222.4m.
The firm said it had seen strong growth in all core brands.
However, it warned that the industry faced higher input costs and continuing consumer caution this year.
"AG Barr has maintained its track record of strong financial performance, delivering double-digit sales and profit growth despite the challenging economic environment," said the group's chief executive, Roger White.
"The soft drink sector will face tough comparative trading across 2011, as well as further cost volatility and general economic uncertainty."
As well as Irn Bru, the Cumbernauld-based firm makes Orangina, Tizer, Rubicon and Ka drinks.
