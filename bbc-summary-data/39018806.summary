[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norwich City 1-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jacob Murphy's equaliser for Norwich City at Carrow Road extended Ipswich Town's wait of almost eight years for a victory in an East Anglian derby.

Jonas Knudsen, who netted in the reverse fixture in August, met Jordan Spence's second-half cross to put Ipswich ahead against the run of play.
But winger Murphy fired a 20-yard shot past Bartosz Bialkowski at his near post to level with 21 minutes left.
Bialkowski later made amends with a stunning stop to deny Alex Tettey.
Norwich moved up a place to eighth but Alex Neil's side are six points off the Championship play-off places, while Ipswich remained 15th with their fourth draw in five outings.
Both derbies this season have ended as 1-1 draws, while Norwich have still not been beaten by their local rivals since April 2009.
Referee Oliver Langford had been the centre of attention before the two goals, refusing to give Ipswich a penalty when David McGoldrick appeared to have been dragged to the ground at a corner and then disallowing a goal from Norwich full-back Mitchell Dijks for handball.
The Canaries pushed for a winner late on but Bialkowski kept out Tettey's powerful 18-yard drive and also a low shot from substitute Alex Pritchard.
Norwich boss Alex Neil told BBC Radio Norfolk:
"I think if you look at pretty much every statistic connected with the game or if you watched the game, I think we were deserving of a win.
"I think the frustrating thing from us was the fact that we've been very good going forward and scoring goals and we just lacked that little bit of a cutting edge that we've had in most games this season.
"Even when we did threaten to score, their keeper pulled off probably three really good saves to keep the game level."
Ipswich boss Mick McCarthy told BBC Radio Suffolk:
"They've had to be really well-organised and resolute and tough and all those horrible things that people don't like when you're getting beat, but when you go to Norwich and get a point everybody respects those qualities.
"(Bartosz Bialkowski) kept them out, he's been brilliant, and he's annoyed that he's let one in - he was just outstanding.
"What was good is that we didn't concede again, and maybe eight weeks ago we'd have lost that game.
"Against a good team, it's just great that we came away with a point."
