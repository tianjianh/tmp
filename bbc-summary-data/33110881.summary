The Port of Grangemouth container terminal is being resurfaced under a Â£1.5m investment programme by owners Forth Ports.
The project will create additional storage lanes for laden containers and improve equipment access to landside and shipside operations.
Forth Ports said the surface upgrade would increase the terminal's total capacity to 12,000 containers.
That represents a 50% increase since 2005.
The work is expected to be completed in October.
A feasibility study has also been launched on deepening the port's shipping channel to enable it to handle larger, heavier container ships and bulk vessels.
Both projects are being undertaken in response to changes in the container shipping market, where there is a trend towards larger capacity vessels which require deeper water.
Forth Ports group chief executive Charles Hammond said: "This is an important investment for the business which will further secure Grangemouth's position as Scotland's largest container terminal.
"We have analysed the shipping trends and identified the growing demand to accommodate larger vessels from around the world.
"Through this investment, we will ensure that the Port of Grangemouth remains front and centre for Scotland's importers and exporters."
Grangemouth currently handles more than 150,000 containers annually, with daily sailings to Rotterdam, Antwerp, Felixstowe and Hamburg.
