Kaleem Ali, 18, approached one of the women who gave evidence in the trial of his father Qurban and five others.
The victim said she had been left "shaking and in fear of her safety".
Ali, of Clough Road, Masborough, received a three-year restraining order at Rotherham Magistrates' Court.
He was also ordered to pay Â£360 towards the cost of the prosecution and given 12-week curfew requirement.
Qurban Ali, 53, was one of six people jailed in February for the "systematic abuse" of  15 girls. He was convicted of conspiracy to rape and jailed for 10 years.
Prosecutor Mark Hughes told the court Kaleem Ali approached the woman in March 2015 as she was in her car with her children.
He said Ali addressed the woman and one child by name and appeared to start taking photographs of them on one mobile phone while using another to make a call.
Reading from the victim's police statement police, he said: "I truly believe this male wanted to scare me and it worked. I was crying and shaking. I was scared he was calling for other people to join him. I had my children with me and I feared for my safety."
Mr Hughes said Ali had accepted seeing the witness but denied taking photographs and denied that his actions were intended to intimidate.
Ali's lawyer, Steve Smith, said his client had learning difficulties which left him unable to understand how people perceived him or his actions.
He said Ali had approached the woman as a result of a "chance meeting".
