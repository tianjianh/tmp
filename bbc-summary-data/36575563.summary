[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Miura scored on Sunday for FC Yokohama after 22 minutes, but his side went on to lose 2-1 to FC Gifu in the J-League's second division.
He reached the milestone at the age of 49 years, three months and 24 days, breaking his own record from last year.
The striker is currently playing in his 31st season of football after signing a contract extension in November.
Miura scored 55 goals in 89 appearances for Japan after debuting in 1990 but never appeared at a World Cup.
The oldest goalscorer in the J-League's top division is former Japan coach Zico, who scored for the Kashima Antlers aged 41 in 1994.
