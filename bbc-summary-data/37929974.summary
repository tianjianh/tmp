Frost, from Dagenham, Essex, had died "peacefully and pain free" last week, Wright announced on his Wednesday show.
The Old Woman, a regular character on the programme, would discuss the news and once presented a game of factoids with Hollywood actor Will Smith.
Wright praised her as "a complete natural on the air" and said she had been a "lovely, lovely person".
On Wednesday's show, Wright told listeners she had been "very opinionated and witty" and always cheeky, funny and charming.
Wright added: "It's a sad loss, thank you for being the Old Woman with us Joyce and we'll miss you very much."
BBC Radio 2's Steve Wright in the Afternoon aired its first episode in 1999 after moving over from BBC Radio 1.
The three-hour programme regularly features characters including The Old Woman and Barry from Watford, as well as popular segment Ask Elvis.
Ms Frost had not done radio before the programme but Wright said she was "unbelievably professional" and never fazed by the big stars.
