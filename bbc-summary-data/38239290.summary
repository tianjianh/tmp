Leicester Tigers backs coach Geordan Murphy says allowing full-back George Worth to play with freedom is key to the 20-year-old's development.

Following injuries to Mathew Tait and Telusa Veainu, Worth has made five first-team appearances since November.
Murphy told BBC Radio Leicester: "Worthy has done brilliantly. He is a fantastic footballer.
"I don't have a lot to tell him; he figures it out himself and we try to keep things simple."
Worth was playing Championship rugby on loan with Nottingham earlier this season, but is expected to start for Tigers in their European Cup match away against Munster on Saturday.
Murphy has been impressed with how Worth has taken his chance.
"Every game he has has played he has done really well," Murphy added.
"The task for him is to stay grounded. He will be under a lot of pressure so this weekend will be a huge test.
"He has moved around and played at 10 for Nottingham. We know how good a footballer he is and he is big boy as well, so the future is very bright.
"We generally have two or three points that we want to work on and two or three areas that Worthy wants to focus on, and that is the same for most of the guys.
"We try not to clutter them with too much information. The guys come up with their own plans and drive that and we are there to assist. Worthy has been on the money so far."
Worth agreed that "keeping things simple" and enjoying his rugby was vital.
"A couple of injuries have come along and have given me the opportunity to play with the big boys," he said.
"I am just trying to enjoy it make the most of it. I am trying to pick the brains of the boys around me who have been there and done it."
