Kembo-Ekoko, a striker with UAE side Al Nasr, and Lorient midfielder Mulumba are in line for their first cap.
Both had previously rejected a number of call-ups to the national team.
Chancel Mbemba of Newcastle United and Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie are also in the 26-man squad.
But there is no place for Dieumerci Mbokani, who is at loggerheads with Dynamo Kiev over his desire to quit the Ukrainian club after being heavily linked with a move to the English Premier League.
The Leopards will also be without their captain and Norwich midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu, who is recuperating after breaking a metatarsal bone in his foot early this month.
