Most wanted man Mark Acklom 'spotted in Geneva'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of Britain's most wanted fugitives, thought to have been at large in Spain, has apparently been photographed in Geneva.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mark Acklom, 43, who allegedly posed as an MI6 agent to con a divorcee from Gloucestershire out of her Â£850,000 life savings, disappeared in 2012.
A photograph, taken on 10 May and said to show him outside a cafe in the Swiss city, was obtained by Sky News.
The National Crime Agency said it was aware of the report.
Carolyn Woods alleged Mr Acklom posed as an MI6 agent and conned her into "lending" him her savings during a year-long romance in Bath.
They met when the former public schoolboy walked into her boutique to buy a jacket and began chatting her up.
Last year a European Arrest Warrant was issued for Mr Acklom, and he was believed to be at large in Spain having been released from a Spanish prison over a Â£200,000 property fraud.
Avon and Somerset Police said its "absolute priority is to locate and arrest Acklom in connection with a high-value fraud".
