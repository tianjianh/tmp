Celtic remain unbeaten in domestic competition this season and confirmed their sixth successive title on Sunday.
Scott Sinclair scored a hat-trick at Tynecastle, with Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts also on target.
"It typifies how they've been for the majority of the season - their attitude, determination, style and intensity," Rodgers told BBC Scotland.
"We knew it would be a tough game and to win a pressure game like that is a remarkable achievement from the players.
"We take the energy and hunger from training into games and, from a coaching perspective, that's great to see.
"The fans have been behind the team from day one. Everyone deserves a huge amount of credit - the players, staff and supporters."

Rodgers took charge of Celtic last summer following the departure of Ronny Deila.
And club captain Scott Brown is in no doubt that the Northern Irishman's appointment set Celtic on the road to a reaching a new level.
"Football-wise, it's been top notch," he said. "The manager has recruited great players and brought belief to everyone. We have really pushed on this season."
Having already won the League Cup, and with a Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers coming up this month, the question now is whether Celtic will remain unbeaten this season and whether they will secure the treble.
Brown, however, refuses to look beyond their next match at home to Partick Thistle in the league.
"The target remains one game at a time," he added. "We've got a big game on Wednesday, so we'll go back to working hard in training."
Hat-trick hero Sinclair, who took his tally for the season to 21 goals in all competitions on Sunday, also exemplified the relentless drive that seems to underpin the attitude instilled by Rodgers.
"It was a performance that was unbelievable from the whole team," Sinclair said. "We've still got work to do and the season is not over yet.
"We keep winning and that's the mentality here - to keep going.
"We take one game at a time. We've done so well, so we just have to keep going."
