[SN]TITLE[SN]
£13.4m Aberavon seafront lido replacement taking shape

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £13.4m replacement for a leisure complex which was destroyed in a fire five years ago is starting to take shape.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The old Afan Lido on Aberavon seafront was wrecked by the blaze in 2009 and demolished two years later.
A row followed about where the replacement would be and what would go inside the new building.
It will include an eight-lane pool, cafe, fitness centre, dance studio and sports hall.
The original Afan Lido was opened in 1965 by the Queen. The new leisure centre is due to be completed by the end of 2015.
