Ashraf Ghani: Afghan leader makes US troops plea

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Afghan president Ashraf Ghani is meeting President Obama to discuss the pace of the US troop withdrawal from his country.

The new Afghan president is expected to ask his American counterpart to keep more troops in his country for longer.
Mr Obama has promised to end America's longest war by the end of his term, leaving only a small force to protect the US embassy.
It is believed Mr Obama will announce his troop decision later today.
The leaders will discuss troop numbers over a working lunch and in meetings, before taking questions during a press conference later this afternoon.
Originally, officials planned to cut the US troop presence to 5,500 by the end of 2015.
But with the prospect of a tough spring fighting season on the horizon, Islamic State militants trying to recruit on Afghan soil and other security concerns, officials are predicting the US will probably leave 9,800 American troops in the country long into next year.
US bases in Jalalabad and Kandahar, the Taliban capital until 2001, are central to the discussions.
President Ghani has requested that those bases remain open as long as possible, and US officials appear to be warm to that idea.
The lunch and meetings come just as gunmen killed at least 13 people in eastern Afghanistan overnight and, separately, a suspected US drone strike near the Afghan-Pakistani border killed nine militants.
However, Mr Ghani's presidency is a welcome change in the eyes of the White House, whose relationship with his predecessor grew increasingly strained in recent years.
When he assumed office, Mr Ghani, who lived in the US for more than a decade, almost immediately signed a security deal with American officials to keep US troops in the country beyond 2014.
The refusal of the previous Afghan administration, led by Hami Karzai, to sign the agreement generated consternation at the White House.
By contrast, Mr Ghani has made clear his appreciation for US support, which has included more than $60bn (Â£40.37bn) being invested in his country's military so far.
"We do not now ask what the United States can do for us," President Ghani said as he opened his US visit, invoking a quote by former US President John F Kennedy. "We want to say what Afghanistan will do for itself and for the world."
After a controversial election with disputed results, President Ghani agreed to share power with his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, who has taken the title of Chief Executive Officer of the country.
Six months into their term, the two leaders have made the trip to the US together in an effort to project unity, despite being unable to build a full cabinet.
In a ceremony at the Pentagon on Monday, Mr Ghani paid tribute to US soldiers who had fought in Afghanistan and thanked the US for its support.
"Each one of you has left a legacy," he said, noting that more than 2,200 Americans lost their lives and 20,000 were wounded in the conflict.
