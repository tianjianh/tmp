Dilma Rousseff impeached: How Brazilians reacted

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
In the end, it was a process as long-winded as it was inevitable: Brazil's Senate voted to impeach and suspend President Dilma Rousseff after a marathon debate.

The all-night session and following result divided Brazilians in the same way as the build-up to the impeachment did.
Two hashtags in particular were widely-used among Brazilians - those for and those against the process.
The term #SeEuFosseADilma (If I Was Dilma) was one of the most popular with her supporters on Twitter.
Elsewhere, even in the chamber itself, the term #TchauQuerida was widely seen - it translates roughly as "Bye bye, dear".
It was a popular slogan on posters and banners leading up to the vote:
In the hours after the vote, it remained one of the top-trending terms on Twitter worldwide, with some 12,000 tweets posted using the term in the hour after Mrs Rousseff's impeachment.
Plenty of people online commented on the length of time it took the Senate to debate - in all, 71 senators, the attorney general and the president of the senate were all given 15 minutes each to speak.
There were plenty of things you could have done in the almost 21 hours it took them to complete their session.
You could have flown on the world's longest flight, from Auckland to Dubai - in fact, in almost 21 hours, you could have flown there and a quarter of the way back.
The shortest-ever war, between the UK and Zanzibar in 1896, was only 38 minutes long. That war could have been fought 31 times in the time it took the debate to finish.
You could have watched the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Hobbit trilogy and the first Godfather film.
Alternatively, you could have watched the entire eight-film Harry Potter series, and have had enough room for toilet breaks in between.
On a related note, #dumbledorepresidente (President Dumbledore), quickly became another trending topic in Brazil on Thursday. Brazilians, fed up of political intrigue, used the term to daydream of an ideal, worry-free country under the leadership of Harry Potter's headmaster.
Several of Brazil's media outlets published their long-awaited headlines just minutes after the impeachment was confirmed.
Their readiness to bid farewell to the centre-left president does not come as that much of a surprise - plenty of right-leaning outlets played an active role in the run-up to the vote.
The headlines are simple but don't beat about the bush. Right-leaning network O Globo features a photo of President Rousseff looking dejected with the headline "Senate removes Dilma by 55 votes to 22".
The centre-right daily Folha de Sao Paulo leads with the headline "Dilma is removed", and points out that this is the second time since the end of Brazil's military dictatorship that a president has been impeached.
The left-leaning newspaper Diario do Centro do Mundo makes its feelings clear with the headline "With a scoreboard of 55 to 22, the coup is approved and Temer takes up the presidency".
On the whole though, the smaller, left-leaning press was slower to publish its reaction to the finale of what has often been referred to as Brazil's real-life House of Cards.
