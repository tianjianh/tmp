Rick Minns, nicknamed Ruddy Muddy, creates his works of arts in the mud, grease and dust on unwashed vans.
He has used his "graffilthy art" to depict an image of Corrie Mckeague, who has been missing since September.
Mr Mckeague's mother Nicola Urquhart said it was "amazing" and hoped the "unusual" artwork would help spread the message in the search for her son.
She said: "It really is a fantastic likeness, I really can't believe he has done that on a back of a van.
"It's so unusual, I've never seen anything like it before. I think it will get people talking."
Mr Mckeague, originally from Dunfermline in Fife, has been missing since a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk on 24 September.
The 23-year-old gunner was last spotted on CCTV walking alone and eating takeaway food at 03:20 BST.
He was seen going into the "Horseshoe" area, a loading bay area close to Brentgovel Street, and not seen coming out again.
Mr Minns, 42, from Wicklewood, Norfolk, who first hit the headlines with his art in 2014, said he was "happy to help" the search.
He said: "Anything that can make a few more people aware - if it's seen by someone and leads to more information that would be great."
