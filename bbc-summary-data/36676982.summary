The 20-year-old is a product of the Baggies youth academy but is yet to appear for the first team.
He has represented England at under-18 level and is the sixth new arrival at Stanley for next season.
"This is what I need, to be playing men's football. I think coming here will be a good learning curve for me," he told the club website.
