[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Tyrrell failed to return after setting off from Brevig on the Isle of Lewis in his home-made vessel on Tuesday morning.
His boat was found off the Western Isles the following day, and his body was recovered nearby.
Mr Tyrrell was wearing his life jacket when he was found.
Stornoway Coastguard had launched a major search after a call from concerned relatives at about 20:00 on Tuesday when Mr Tyrrell failed to return home in his three-metre boat.
It is understood he had not left word as to where he was going, and did not have a radio or mobile phone with him.
Search teams eventually found his submerged boat in the Minch area.
In a statement issued through police, his family said: "Now that family are aware, we confirm that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, Thomas Tyrrell was found deceased following a land and sea search.
"We would like to point out that Thomas had and was wearing his life jacket when found.
"We would like to thank all emergency services - Coastguard, RNLI, Hebrides Search and Rescue Team and Police for their efforts and for finding Thomas."
