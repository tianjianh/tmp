[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A solid batting display from Nottinghamshire's middle-order set up a four-wicket win over Sussex at Hove.

Chasing 283, Notts lost Riki Wessels lbw first ball to Alfonso Thomas.
But fine half-centuries from captain James Taylor (51) and Brendan Taylor (62), and 42 not out from Steven Mullaney saw the visitors to 285-6.
In the Sussex innings, openers Chris Nash (49) and Luke Wright (40) shared a stand of 96, but nobody could go beyond fifty as they reached 282-9.
Jake Ball claimed 4-47 for the visitors, while Chris Read took six catches behind the stumps, including all of seamer Ball's wickets.
After the dismissal of Wessels in the Nottinghamshire chase, James Taylor took the attack to the bowlers hitting eight fours and a six in his 43-ball innings, as they raced to 114-2 in the 14th over.
Wickets fell at regular intervals once the skipper was out, but Mullaney and Read (22 not out) calmly saw their side home with 22 balls to spare.
