The rear side window was smashed before the crew had got out of the vehicle in Castle Gates, Shrewsbury, at 03:30 BST, the ambulance service said.
It said two people approached the ambulance and one punched the window.
The crew, who were unhurt, quickly left the scene and police were called, the ambulance service said.
Area manager Adrian Ball said: "Attacking our staff and vehicles is an abhorrent crime which we take an incredibly dim view of.
"This is an incredibly disappointing case which means we have an ambulance off the road and unable to respond to 999 calls whilst it's being repaired.
"Thankfully my staff weren't hurt but they were understandably upset by the incident."
