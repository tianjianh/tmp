[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a major new transport hub in Cardiff have been put forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A bus station with 14 stands, cycle "hub" with 502 spaces and retail units could be built on the Marland House and NCP car park site at Central Square.
The city's former bus station was flattened to make way for BBC Wales' new headquarters.
The plans will go before Cardiff council's planning committee on Wednesday.
They also include plans for a five-storey office block, a nine-storey apartment block and a private car park.
