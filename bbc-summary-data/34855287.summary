Christian Walton: Brighton goalkeeper rejoins Plymouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton and Hove Albion goalkeeper Christian Walton has rejoined Plymouth Argyle on loan until January.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 20-year-old England youth international was born in Cornwall and joined Argyle at the age of 10 before being signed by Brighton.
He had been on a season-long loan at Bury, but returned to Brighton after getting injured in August.
Argyle need cover after first-choice goalkeeper Luke McCormick suffered a groin injury.
Reserve goalkeeper James Bittner made his first Football League start in McCormick's place, 4,991 days after first sitting on the bench for a Football League club.
