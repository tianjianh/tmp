Brendan Rodgers was pleased his Celtic side were able to show a different side to their game in the win over Dundee.

Having scored 13 goals in their previous four games, Scott Brown's solitary strike proved to be enough at Dens Park.
"Very satisfying," said Rodgers. "These are the types of games that you need to see through.
"We only needed the one goal and, after that, we defended very, very well. Great victory for us."
Celtic had drawn 3-3 with Manchester City in Wednesday's enthralling Champions League encounter in Glasgow.
"Naturally, there was a little bit of sharpness missing from our game today with so much over the last number of weeks, in particular the game during the week," Rodgers explained.
"The important thing today was the result. The last week has shown us what a really, really good team we are.
"Over the course of the week, we've shown that we can be really offensive - on our last game against Kilmarnock, 6-1, the midweek game was outstanding at the really top level of football - and we showed another side to come away from home and see out a 1-0 win."
Rodgers also praised match-winner Brown and goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who again retained his place ahead of Dorus de Vries, who had displaced the Scot earlier in the season.
"Again, brilliant today," Rodgers said of Brown.
"Really dominated the middle of the field. He's a fantastic player. From the experience I have working with really outstanding midfield players, he's right up there. A great goal.
"I thought Craig Gordon was brilliant. Hopefully, you see the improvement in terms of his distribution. The build-up part of our game is vital to how we play."
Dundee boss Paul Hartley was not too discouraged, despite his side sitting on six points from eight games going into the international break.
"We were in the game all the time," explained. "The players were terrific. We were brave.
"Celtic did have a lot of possession, but they never really cut us open.
"Onwards and upwards for us. If we perform like that from now until the end of the season then we'll be fine."
