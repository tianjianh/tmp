The operator of two indoor winter sports sites in Scotland has won a contract to run a new Â£30m snowsports centre in England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ice Factor Group will operate the indoor complex planned for Middlehaven, Middlesbrough.
The project got the go-ahead from councillors last week.
Ice Factor Group owns Snow Factor Braehead near Glasgow and Ice Factor Kinlochleven, the world's largest indoor ice climbing centre.
Running the Middlesbrough complex will be the first time the group has operated outside of Scotland.
The new centre is expected to create more than 300 jobs.
It will include a 557ft (170m) ski slope, climbing area, indoor sky-diving centre, shops and cafes.
Developer Cool Runnings (NE) expect the centre to attract more than two million visitors a year.
Building work is due to start early next year, with a forecast opening by the summer of 2019.
Middlesbrough Council described the scheme as a "massive step" in the town's regeneration plans.
