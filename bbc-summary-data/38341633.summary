Worcestershire are hoping to sign a new overseas player for the first half of next season after Australia all-rounder John Hastings suffered a knee injury.

Hastings was due to play a full campaign for the Division Two side.
But the 31-year-old tore his patella tendon while playing for Australian side Victoria in the Sheffield Shield.
"Hopefully he will make an impact in the second half of the season should the operation go well," director of cricket Steve Rhodes said.
"We are seeking an alternative overseas bowler for the first half of the season, a quality replacement and the search is already on."
Pace bowler Hastings, who played for Durham in 2014 and 2015, has won 28 caps for Australia in one-day cricket and featured in nine Twenty20 internationals.
He made his only Test match appearance against South Africa in 2012.
Worcestershire also dealt with injury problems to their overseas players last season, with New Zealand all-rounder Mitchell Santner able to play just two games for the county because of a broken finger.
