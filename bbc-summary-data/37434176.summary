England manager Sam Allardyce has said it could soon have no English bosses.
Howe, one of the league's seven British bosses, says he is "in favour of the best person" regardless of nationality.
"I have no problem with the fact that the Premier League doesn't have as many English, or British, managers as it should," the 38-year-old told BBC TV's The Premier League Show.
"I think we [Britons] have to prove we're good enough for those jobs."
Howe led Bournemouth to two promotions in three seasons after returning for a second spell in 2012, taking them into the Premier League for the first time in 2015.
Having been linked with the England vacancy before Allardyce's appointment, Howe was asked by interviewer Gary Lineker if the national coach's role appealed to him in the future.
"The England job, I think, is the ultimate. I would never say no, but it's not something I want to consider," Howe said in the show, which airs on BBC Two at 22:00 BST on Thursday.
"That's not something in my immediate thoughts. My immediate thoughts is this club and this job," he added.
Howe said his ambitious nature could mean he might leave the Cherries "down the line", but added: "If I want to be the best manager I can be, I need to get 'now' right.
"That's why I'd say I'm fiercely ambitious for this club - if the club does well, the team does well, everyone will benefit."
The Premier League show will be available on iPlayer from 00:00 BST on Saturday.
