[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Crewe Alexandra fought back to draw with Newport County despite having Perry Ng sent off after 17 minutes.

Frank Nouble put Newport ahead when he tapped in after Joss Labadie's shot was saved by Crewe goalkeeper Ben Garratt.
Ng had been booked moments before the goal and the defender earned a second yellow for sliding in soon after.
But a minute after the dismissal Crewe got themselves back on level terms, when Chris Dagnall converted George Cooper's low cross from the byline.
Newport County manager Mike Flynn told BBC Wales Sport:
"It was very frustrating... we created enough chances to win two or three matches, but also weren't very switched on with the counter-attack against us.
"Fair play to them, with 10 men they rolled up their sleeves and caused us a few problems, but if you don't take the chances you create you're always going to struggle.
"We switched off on certain things: when we got a corner we didn't lock them in on the edge of the box and they break on us, or we leave two v two at the back. It's crazy because we don't work on that."
Match ends, Crewe Alexandra 1, Newport County 1.
