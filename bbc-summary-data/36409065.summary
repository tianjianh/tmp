A police force has referred itself to the watchdog over the death of a woman hours after she spoke to officers about an alleged assault.

Greater Manchester Police spoke to the 42-year-old in Failsworth on Saturday after an abandoned 999 call.
The woman had minor facial injuries and a 57-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of assault.
Police later returned to the property in Oldham Road to take a statement from the woman but found her dead.
A post-mortem examination found that the cause of death was "not suspicious", a Greater Manchester Police spokeswoman said.
A mandatory referral to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) was made because police had been in touch with the woman prior to her death.
Det Ch Insp Howard Millington said: "First and foremost I would like to express our most sincere condolences to the woman's family for their tragic loss.
"In line with our usual policy when an incident such as this occurs, we have made referral to the IPCC and we await their decision on whether or not they wish to investigate."
He added: "In the meantime, we are continuing to investigating the circumstances surrounding the initial call that was made to police which prompted officers to attend and arrest a 57-year-old man on suspicion of assault."
