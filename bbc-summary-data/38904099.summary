Pick, 25, who lost his leg while serving with the Army in Afghanistan in 2010, was second in the SB-LL2 event.
He was beaten by Finn Matti Suur-Hamari, whose time of one minute, 7.82 seconds bettered Pick's 1:08.23.
Moore, whose arm was left paralysed after a motorbike accident, finished third in the SB-UL category.
Both athletes will now be aiming for medals at next year's Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang.
"I've been knocking on the door for the last three years behind these guys," said Pick, from Cambridge. "I'm really happy with my first podium at a world championships and only missing out on first place by 0.5secs."
Moore, from Plymouth, won silver and bronze at the last world championships two years ago, and was pleased with his medal after suffering a serious crash in training two weeks ago which put his participation in doubt.
"I am so relieved, happy and excited all at the same time," he said. "I love Canada and this resort in particular, but I even surprised myself with that run and it feels good."
