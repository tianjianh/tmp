[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ugandan Miya to join Standard Liege

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Uganda striker Farouk Miya is set to sign for Belgian giants Standard Liege from Vipers Sports Club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The clubs have agreed a fee of about US$400,000 for the 19-year-old and hope to complete the deal after the African Nations Championship in Rwanda.
Miya scored a penalty and made an assist in a 2-2 draw with Mali in Uganda's opening match of the finals.
However, he will miss his Saturday's match against Zambia as a precaution to help him overcome a shoulder problem.
Last season Miya scored 11 goals and made seven assists to help Vipers win the Uganda Premier League trophy.
If he can agree personal terms with Standard Liege, it will bring an end to a two-year spell with Vipers.
