Just under 5,000 people cycled a 128km (79 mile) through Cambridgeshire on Sunday.
The race started in Peterborough and catered for amateurs of all abilities on closed roads.
Dubbed the 'Tour of Cambridgeshire', the route took in towns and villages across the county, including Alconbury and Whittlesey.
Andrew Williams from club Cwmcarn Paragon won it for the men, with Cambridge's Laura Massey crowned the fastest woman.
The Gran Fondo mass participation race, which is more common in Europe, marked the end of a weekend of cycling, with a 28km (17.4 mile) closed-road time trial taking place along the route on Saturday.
Organisers said it had been successful and hoped the Gran Fondo would return in the future.
Last summer, the county hosted the Tour de France's final English leg, with thousands of people lining the route to watch.
