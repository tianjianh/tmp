Chickens and ducks with avian flu have been found at a property in North Yorkshire.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the flock at Settle consisted of about 17 birds.
The strain of H5N8 avian flu is the same as the one found in Wales on 3 January and at a farm in Lincolnshire in December.
Defra said the risk to public health was "very low".
The UK's chief veterinary officer, Nigel Gibbens, said some of the birds had died from the disease with the remainder being humanely culled.
A 1.6 mile (3km) protection zone and a six mile (10km) surveillance area have been put in place around the infected premises to reduce the risk of the disease spreading.
Mr Gibbens said: "This finding in a back-yard flock shows how essential it is for all poultry owners, even those who just keep a few birds as pets, to do everything they can to keep them separate from wild birds and minimise the risk of them catching avian flu via the environment."
Defra introduced an "Avian Influenza Prevention Zone" on 6 December, which lasts until 28 February, to help protect poultry and captive birds from avian flu.
It requires keepers of poultry and other captive birds to keep them indoors or take steps to keep them separate from wild birds.
The zone covers England and similar restrictions have been introduced in Scotland and Wales.
It was introduced after the H5N8 bird flu strain was found in poultry and wild birds in 14 countries including Germany and France.
