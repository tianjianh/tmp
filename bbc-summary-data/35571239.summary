Saturday's 1-0 defeat by Southampton left the Swans three points above the bottom three.
But Guidolin, who succeeded Garry Monk in January, believes Swansea are in a stronger position than when he first arrived.
"If it wasn't difficult at Swansea, I would not be here," he said.
"I am here and I am happy to be here. I hope to help my team and my club, our fans.
"In a season when there is one manager go out, there is a bad period. So another manager is a sign of difficulty.
"I have no fear because I know this situation."
The loss to Southampton was Guidolin's first since taking charge at the Liberty Stadium, having won one and drawn two of his first three games.
Swansea are 16th in the Premier League table and face two difficult away fixtures next, travelling to title contenders Tottenham and Arsenal.
"When I arrived, the table was worse. I don't think if we have three or four or five or six points [above the relegation zone] it's so different," added Guidolin.
"I think our table is not good, but I thought this after the two victories against Watford [for which Guidolin was a spectator] and Everton.
"I think we have only got to think match by match.
"I don't think about the table, only about how we can improve our performance."
