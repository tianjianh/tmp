Mother-of-two Ms Coggins has been described by her boyfriend as "hardworking" and "just beautiful".
The friends died in the early hours of Thursday while on a girls' holiday in Lloret de Mar on the Costa Brava.
Police said the women were swept away by waves and the beach had been closed to the public the day before.
Ms Coggins, 35, is thought to have worked at the Costco wholesalers in Birmingham.
Rescue teams were alerted at 04:15 local time after the women failed to return from a swim in the sea, a Spanish news website said.
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We can confirm the death of two British nationals who had been reported missing in Lloret de Mar on 1 October.
"We are providing support to the families and those who were travelling with the individuals at this difficult time.
