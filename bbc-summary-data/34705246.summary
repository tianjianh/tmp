Jose Mourinho: Chelsea boss gets stadium ban and fine

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has been given a one-match stadium ban with immediate effect and also fined £40,000 by the Football Association.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The punishment comes after Mourinho admitted a misconduct charge over his language and behaviour in the defeat by West Ham on 24 October.
Mourinho, 52, was sent to the stands after going to speak to referee Jon Moss in his room at half-time.
He will miss Chelsea's league game at Stoke on Saturday, unless he appeals.
Mourinho will receive the FA's written reasons this week and, if he contests the punishment, he could still be on the bench at the Britannia Stadium.
The stadium ban is separate to the suspended one he received along with a £50,000 fine for comments he made after the loss to Southampton on 3 October.
The Portuguese described that fine as a "disgrace" and appealed.
Mourinho's assistant, Silvino Louro, was also charged by the FA after being dismissed during the match at West Ham in relation to his behaviour in the technical area.
In a statement, the FA withdrew an improper conduct charge against Louro but reminded him of his responsibilities.

The stadium ban for Chelsea's next game adds to Mourinho's problems as the pressure intensifies on him.
In addition to his disciplinary problems with the FA, the Portuguese has been criticised for his treatment of former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro.
Carneiro was dropped from first-team duties after Mourinho said she was "naive" for treating Eden Hazard during the opening-day draw at home to Swansea.
She has since left Chelsea and Mourinho is to be the subject of individual legal action from Carneiro, who is also suing the Stamford Bridge club for constructive dismissal.
On the pitch, his side are 15th in the Premier League having lost six times in 11 games in defence of their Premier League crown.
The latest defeat was a 3-1 home loss to Liverpool that left the Blues 14 points behind leaders Manchester City.
Chelsea's all-time top scorer Frank Lampard, who played under Mourinho, said the club should be looking for stability.
Speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, he said: "That's the intriguing thing at the moment to see if they stick with him.
"He is a world-class manager. I think they should stick with him but results need to change now."
