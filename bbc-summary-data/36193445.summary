[SN]TITLE[SN]
Kosovo elected to Uefa and can apply to join Fifa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kosovo have been granted membership of European governing body Uefa.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The vote was 28-24 in favour of the country which declared independence from Serbia in 2008. The Serbs strongly opposed Kosovo's election.
Kosovo played their first international friendly in 2014 after being granted permission by football's global governing body Fifa.
Joining Uefa means they can now apply to Fifa and could play in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup if accepted.
Kosovo, which is still not a United Nations member, previously attempted to recruit the services of Manchester United's Adnan Januzaj, who was born to Kosovan-Albanian parents.
But the 21-year-old winger has since played for Belgium, the country of his birth.
Kosovo's complicated political status has seen several players born in the state play for different countries, including Xherdan Shaqiri and Valon Behrami (Switzerland), Shefki Kuqi (Finland) and Lorik Cana (Albania).
