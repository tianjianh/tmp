Copeland MP Jamie Reed has resigned as Shadow health minister following Jeremy Corbyn's victory in the Labour leadership contest.

In a letter released immediately after Mr Corbyn's win was announced, he blamed differences over nuclear policies.
It said: "I will not let anything or anyone from any party stand in the way of the ambitions of my community."
Mr Corbyn secured almost 60% of votes in the leadership contest.
Copeland is home to the Sellafield nuclear site which provides employment for thousands of people from the local area.
Mr Reed's letter said: "Over 10 years I have managed to secure funding for new hospitals and schools and to establish new nuclear policy.
"Your opposition to this, as with David Cameron when he became Leader of the Opposition, is poorly informed and fundamentally wrong."
Left-winger Mr Corbyn was a 200-1 outsider when the three-month leadership contest began, but he swept to victory with a landslide majority.
