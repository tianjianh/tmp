Anglesea abuse case: Police officers cleared of misconduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two North Wales Police officers, who it was claimed failed to follow up allegations against a former police chief, have been cleared of misconduct.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former superintendent, Gordon Anglesea, was convicted of historical child sex offences last month.
The claim made in court about the two officers was referred to the force's professional standards team.
But Chief Constable Mark Polin said an internal inquiry had found "no evidence of misconduct... to this point".
The National Crime Agency's Operation Pallial investigators discovered that in 2002 one of Anglesea's victims had passed a note to officers naming him as an abuser.
Records indicated they took no further action.
But Mr Polin said: "It has been investigated from a misconduct perspective and no evidence of misconduct has been found to this point."
He went on to give assurances that nothing would be swept under the carpet: "Any allegations of misconduct will be investigated. They will be investigated thoroughly and objectively."
Anglesea, 79, from Old Colwyn, was convicted of one charge of indecent assault against one boy, and three indecent assaults against another.
He is due to be sentenced on Friday at Mold Crown Court.
