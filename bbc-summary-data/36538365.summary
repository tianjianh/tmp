BBC Sport has taken a look at when some of the big matches, managerial reunions and hostile welcomes are scheduled to take place throughout the season.
All dates and times of matches are subject to change.
Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has helped his side win the Premier League title twice and the fixtures he looks out for are, unsurprisingly, the Manchester derbies.
"They are the ones I enjoy most," said Kompany who is working for BBC Sport as a pundit during Euro 2016. "In all the fixtures you have good and bad moments but playing against Tottenham is always a good occasion.
"Next season I'm also looking forward to playing West Han away in a different stadium. It will be a new experience and it adds a new dimension to the Premier League."
Jose Mourinho won the Premier League title with Chelsea on three occasions and it may well be an emotional occasion on 22 October, when he takes his new Manchester United side to Stamford Bridge.
New Everton boss Ronald Koeman will expect a lively reception when he faces his former side Southampton on 26 November with the return game at Goodison Park on 2 January.
Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe takes on a Burnley side he managed for a year with the two teams meeting in Burnley on 10 December and then again in Bournemouth on the penultimate weekend of the season.
BBC Sport's Simon Stone: "Champions Leicester City can have no complaints about how their entry into European football has been treated.
"Top four managers tend to look with suspicion at the fixtures that follow each of their Champions League games, when travel fatigue can be a factor.
"Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri will be happy to see his side have been given six home games immediately after those matches, Arsenal have four and Tottenham two.
"Manchester City have three but they must get through an August qualifier before new manager Pep Guardiola can be certain of a familiar campaign in Europe's premier club competition."
BBC Sport's Simon Stone: "Premier League managers are not the only ones who keep a close eye on fixtures release day. International managers also get affected, especially when matches involving their players get moved for TV.
"So Roy Hodgson, if he remains in charge of England beyond Euro 2016, might not be too happy to find some of the games that immediately precede World Cup qualifiers.
"Tottenham and Liverpool, who between them are responsible for 10 of Hodgson's 23-man squad in France, play in the last round of matches before the September internationals, Tottenham v Man City is before October's.
"Arsenal have a North London derby against Tottenham before England play Scotland on 11 November.
"And Manchester City play Liverpool and Tottenham take on Southampton before March's games."
Bournemouth v Manchester United, Arsenal v Liverpool, Burnley v Swansea City, Chelsea v West Ham United, Crystal Palace v West Bromwich Albion, Everton v Tottenham Hotspur, Hull City v Leicester City, Manchester City v Sunderland, Middlesbrough v Stoke City, Southampton v Watford.
Tottenham finished third last season, their highest ever position in the Premier League, and travel to Goodison Park on the first weekend of the campaign. It will be Ronald Koeman's first game in charge of Everton and former Spurs midfielder Jermaine Jenas thinks that will make it tougher for the London side.
"Tottenham have set the benchmark of what they can achieve and they should be going for the title this year," Jenas told BBC Sport. "Every match at Everton is tough, but with a new manager even more so."
Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown says his side will get off to a great start to the season if they can defeat Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool on the opening weekend.
Arsenal finished second in the Premier League, while Klopp guided Liverpool to the Europa League final, and Keown believes the Anfield side will be Premier League title challengers this season.
"Jurgen Klopp will have brought in new players by then and if Arsenal can win that game then they are off and running as I see Liverpool as one of the favourites," Keown told BBC Sport.
Arsenal v West Bromwich Albion, Burnley v Middlesbrough, Chelsea v Bournemouth, Hull City v Manchester City, Leicester City v Everton, Liverpool v Stoke City, Manchester United v Sunderland, Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur, Swansea City v West Ham United, Watford v Crystal Palace.
Here are the fixtures for the final weekend of the season on 21 May. Will a team already be crowned champions by then? Or could it go down to the wire?
Arsenal v Everton, Burnley v West Ham United, Chelsea v Sunderland, Hull City v Tottenham Hotspur, Leicester City v Bournemouth, Liverpool v Middlesbrough, Manchester United v Crystal Palace, Southampton v Stoke City, Swansea City v West Bromwich Albion, Watford v Manchester City.
