[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Christopher John Barry, 53, was killed on Sunday evening at his home in The Broadway, Edmonton. Post-mortem tests found he had been stabbed in the chest.
The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will appear at Highbury Corner Youth Court on Wednesday.
Another boy aged 13, and three aged 14, have been bailed until January after their arrest on suspicion of murder.
Mr Barry, who was known as Jack, is understood to have been returning home with a female friend, when he was involved in an altercation with a group as he tried to get into the building.
Det Chief Insp Neale Baldock, of the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who is leading the investigation, said a "supervised party" had been taking place at another address in the block.
Mr Barry suffered a stab wound to the chest which led to police and London's air ambulance being called.
He was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after 20:30 GMT.
