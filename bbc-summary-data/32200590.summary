Her body was found after a blaze at the property at Tower Link, in the Parkhall housing estate, on Monday evening.
Fire crews were called to the scene shortly after 18:00 BST.
A police cordon was still in place outside the house on Tuesday morning and further forensic examinations are expected to take place later.
Antrim and Newtownabbey councillor Adrian Cochrane-Watson said there was "total shock" and "disbelief" in the local community over Ms Melvin's sudden death.
"I grew up several streets away from here.  This is a very tight, very respectful community - everyone knows everyone," he said.
"Certainly Susie is well known to many people in the Parkhall estate and no-one wants to see a death in these circumstances."
Mr Cochrane-Watson told BBC Radio Ulster he had spoken to police both on Monday night and Tuesday morning about the investigation.
"There was certainly a very thorough forensic investigation under way last night. I'm led to believe that is to continue," the councillor said.
"I'm led to believe there are a number of lines of inquiry being investigated but as yet the cause of death had not been confirmed."
Three fire engines attended the incident on Monday, and on arrival firefighters discovered there had been a "small fire" in the house.
The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service said the cause of the fatal blaze is still under investigation.
