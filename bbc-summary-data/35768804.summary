A former primary school head teacher has avoided jail after admitting making indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ross Workman, former head of Oldswinford C of E Primary School in Stourbridge, was sentenced to a three-year community order with supervision.
The 51-year-old, of Low Fold Close, Worcester, was also ordered to register as a sex offender for five years at a hearing at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
He had previously admitted six counts of making indecent images of children.
The offences happened between January and March 2011.
Workman was arrested in November 2014 and parents were informed about the investigation by letter.
Jenny Birchall, current head teacher at Oldswinford CE Primary School, said: "There is no suggestion or evidence that the school, its staff, or the pupils of our school are involved in any way.
"Our school continues as normal, and I hope this will be a fresh chapter for Oldswinford CE Primary."
