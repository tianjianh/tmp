Vigilante group attacks 'paedophiles' in Greater Manchester

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Vigilantes are posing as underage girls on the internet and then attacking men who they have agreed to meet up with, Greater Manchester Police have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two men, aged 19 and 25, were attacked in separate incidents after arranging to meet girls online.
In the first incident, on Friday, a man was attacked in Atherton, while on Saturday, a second man was attacked in a car park in Wigan.
Det Insp Charlotte Cadden said vigilantism was unacceptable.
She said: "These men were targeted because they had illegally arranged to meet up with underage girls online.
"I want to make it clear that grooming and arranging to meet up with children you have met over the internet is a criminal offence and if you are caught doing this you will be arrested and prosecuted."
But she added:  "It is unacceptable that this group are posing as underage girls and meeting up with men with the view to either blackmailing them or attacking them in the street."
