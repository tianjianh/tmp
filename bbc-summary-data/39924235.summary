The RNLI lifeguards are in their final two weeks of training at Camber Sands before they start patrols on 27 May.
Five men died during a day-trip to the beach in August 2016. A month earlier, two others also lost their lives.
Families of the men believe a lifeguard service could have saved their lives.
How to stay safe at the beach and the sea
Joe Mitchell, RNLI Lifeguard Supervisor, said: "They've already completed a high standard of training and fitness tests, and these next two weeks are about really familiarising themselves with this beach.

The lifeguards will be patrolling Camber Sands between 10:00 and 18:00 BST, seven days a week at two locations.
Four will be at Camber Sands Central from 27 May until 1 October and further two will patrol at Camber Sands West from 8 July until 10 September.
The patrols at Camber Sands in East Sussex are being funded by Rother District Council at a cost of Â£51,000.
More than one million people each year visit the beach each year, which can attract up to 25,000 people "on a fine day", the council has said.
