[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A care worker who was distracted on her mobile phone when the man she was looking after wandered off and drowned has been jailed for four months.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nikki Deaney was meant to be giving Majid Akhtar one-to-one care during a trip to a reservoir in 2012.
An inquest previously concluded that Nikki Deaney's failure of care resulted in the 28-year-old's death.
Deaney, 29, from Nottingham, admitted contravening health and safety regulations.
Mr Akhtar had severe learning difficulties and epilepsy, and had a mental age of four.
The inquest jury concluded he probably fell unconscious via a seizure, which meant he was unable to prevent himself from drowning.
He was found by two people walking their dog and was later pronounced dead in hospital.
Deaney told police she had only lost sight of him for about three seconds - but phone records showed she was on the phone and texting during the half-hour before his death.
Deaney, from Sneinton Dale in Nottingham, was employed by Nottingham City Council as a day centre care assistant.
The council's director for adult social care, Helen Jones, said: "Majid Akhtar's family have our deepest sympathy - he died on a day out which should have been enjoyable but ended in tragedy."
