Doncaster Rovers 2-2 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League Two leaders Doncaster dropped points for the fifth consecutive game as they were held to a draw by valiant Accrington.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonny Edwards netted an equaliser nine minutes from time to deny Rovers, who are now three points clear of Plymouth at the top.
The visitors took a shock lead with just four minutes gone when Shay McCarten robbed the ball from Conor Grant in midfield, charged half the length of the pitch and finished confidently past Ian Lawlor.
Doncaster responded well to the setback and went close through Alfie May and James Coppinger, but they did find the leveller after 20 minutes when Matty Blair charged down the right and found Tommy Rowe, who finished well at the second attempt.
Rovers went in front in the 58th minute as May flicked on a Coppinger cross, leaving John Marquis through on goal to finish confidently.
Doncaster looked comfortable with their lead and pushed for a third, but they were hit with a hammer blow when Accrington levelled.
A free-kick from deep was headed back across goal allowing substitute Edwards to nod in from close range.
Rowe could have won it late for Rovers but curled wide after going through on goal.
