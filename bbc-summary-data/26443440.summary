The New York Times has published a correction to an article published 161 years ago on the case portrayed in the Oscar-winning film 12 Years a Slave.

The story published on 20 January 1853 chronicles the kidnapping and enslavement of a free black man named Solomon Northup.
In the piece Northup's name was misspelled twice, as Northrop and Northrup.
The error was discovered after a digital copy circulated in recent days.
Rebecca Skloot, author of the best-selling non-fiction book The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, brought the initial error to light, tweeting a link to the story on Monday.
The correction was published in Tuesday's New York Times.
12 Years a Slave won three Academy Awards on Sunday: Best Picture, Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay) and Best Actress in a Supporting Role by Lupita Nyong'o.
