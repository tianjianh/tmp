Bristol mayor election: Charles Lucas is Conservative candidate

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Conservatives have chosen their candidate for the Bristol mayoral elections due to be held next May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Charles Lucas, a city councillor for the past two years, was chosen over Steve Smith, a GP surgery manager.
Labour will be represented by Marvin Rees, the Liberal Democrats by Kay Barnard, and independents George Ferguson, the current mayor, and John Langley will also stand.
The Greens are expected to select their candidate in October.
Mr Lucas is a member of the Development Control Committee, and of the Neighbourhood Partnership for Cabot, Clifton and Clifton East.
Last week the Green candidate for the Bristol West parliamentary constituency, Darren Hall, urged fellow members to back Mr Ferguson.
The elected mayor leads the city council and its full range of services, with a turnover of about Â£1bn a year.
Mr Ferguson became the first person to fill the role, which replaced that of council leader, when he won the mayoral election of May 2012.
