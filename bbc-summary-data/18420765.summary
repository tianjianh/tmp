The London Array is being built in the Thames Estuary at the moment and will eventually have 175 turbines installed across a vast area.
These turbines are big - each one is higher than the London Eye!
When the wind farm is completed at the end of the year, it will be able to power 470,000 homes.
The government wants 15% of our energy to come from renewable sources by the year 2020.
While wind is more environmentally friendly than options like coal, gas and nuclear, critics say the wind doesn't always blow and turbines can harm local wildlife.
Watch Joe's report to find out more.
