The parents of a group of teenagers, who were saved after being trapped by rising coastal tides, have raised money to thank their rescuers.

The 34 youngsters and two adults from Ahvas Yisroel Community Centre in Stamford Hill, London, became stuck in an area in Kent prone to rock falls.
An RNLI helicopter and three lifeboats rescued them on Monday evening.
The parents have now raised £5,000 and said they would continue to raise funds for the rescue charity.
Mark Finnis, coxswain of Dover RNLI, said the group had passed "nine warning signs" deterring them from the walk.
The teenagers had to use their mobile phones to shine lights so the lifeguards could find them.
"It could have ended up a whole lot worse," Mr Finnis told BBC London.
"None of the people we took on board our lifeboat were dressed in any attire that you would associate with clambering over rocks."
Shimon Cohen, spokesman for the Ahavat Yisrael Community Centre, said: "Mistakes happen, and of course they are very sorry for putting the wonderful volunteers out to do what they did but lessons have been learned."
He said the money was raised after parents said they had to do something for the RNLI.
A spokeswoman for the RNLI said the donation was incredibly generous and they were happy to help them.
