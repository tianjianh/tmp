Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was arrested on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act.
A property on Thelwall Avenue in Fallowfield, Manchester is being searched as part of the investigation.
Twenty-two people were killed by suicide bomber Salman Abedi after an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May.
Police forensics teams have taken photos of the inside of the housing association property and the contents of the bins outside.
A young man and a woman, covering their faces, were led away by plain clothes detectives and taken away in an unmarked car.
Neighbours said a Libyan family has been living at the address for a number of years - a mother, two sons and a daughter, though the father is believed to be in Libya.
Ali Mohamed, visiting a friend at a house across the road, said: "I saw Salman Abedi here. He didn't show any danger or anything bad. He just seemed like a normal kid."
It is understood the arrested man was on an inbound flight to the UK when he was held at the airport.
The man, who remains in custody, is the 23rd person to be held in the investigation.
Two people were de-arrested and 20 others were freed without charge.
Someone is de-arrested if police find the person in custody has no case to answer before the paperwork for their arrest has been processed.
On Thursday, GMP's head of counter terrorism Ch Supt Russ Jackson said Abedi was not part of a larger network.
However, he said officers believed other people may have been "aware or complicit" in the bombing.
