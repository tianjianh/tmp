Dundee care home must make 'urgent improvements'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Dundee care home has been told to make "urgent improvements" in the care provided to its vulnerable residents.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Care Inspectorate said an inspection of Brae Cottage Residential Home in Broughty Ferry raised "serious concerns."
The regulator has served the home with a formal improvement notice listing five areas requiring immediate attention.
These include staffing levels and restraint of residents.
A Care Inspectorate spokesman said: "Our inspection raised serious concerns and we will report on that inspection in full in due course.
"The improvement notice we have issued clearly lays out the improvements we must see so that the care provided to residents improves quickly.
"We will visit this care home again soon to check on progress and if we are not satisfied that the matters raised are being addressed urgently we will not hesitate to take further action."
The home's manager has been given until the end of April to ensure there are sufficient numbers of staff "appropriate to the health, welfare and safety of service users."
A system to ensure no resident is subject to restraint "unless it is the only practicable way of securing their welfare and safety" must be in place by 30 March.
The service must also carry out full assessments on all environmental issues which may cause harm to people in the home.
The notice also said that radiators in the home must be fitted with covers by the end of February to protect residents from the risk of burns.
