Premiership strugglers Worcester have signed Samoa international forward Chris Vui on a short-term deal until the end of the season.

New Zealand-born Vui, who can play at lock forward or in the back row, earned his first cap for Samoa against France last month.
"Chris is a big, powerful and adaptable forward," said head coach Carl Hogg.
"He will certainly add some strength to our pack. And, at just 23, he is an experienced leader."
But he will not make an immediate debut in Saturday's European Challenge Cup tie at home to Newport Gwent Dragons as he is not yet registered for European games.
"He will not be involved this weekend," Warriors backs coach Sam Vesty told BBC Sport. "His registration becomes an issue when you're talking about Europe."
Worcester also play the Dragons in the away leg the following weekend but it might not be clear until after this Saturday's game whether Vui would then be involved at Rodney Parade. "We will make that decision as we go forward," added Vesty.
Vui, who represented New Zealand at Under-20 level in the 2013 World Rugby Championship, has played all his club rugby in his native country.
He captained New Zealand side North Harbour to the Mitre 10 Championship title in October, having played for Auckland Blues in the 2015 Super Rugby campaign.
Vui is the fourth short-term signing made by injury-hit Warriors in little over a month following the arrival of Australian scrum-half Michael Dowsett, Bristol full-back Auguy Slowik and Canada fly-half Connor Braid.
Going into the two-week break for European action, Warriors lie next to bottom in the Premiership after just one win this season, six points clear of bottom club Bristol, who they are due to meet at Ashton Gate on Boxing Day.
