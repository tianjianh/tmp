The 22-year-old is Grecians boss Paul Tisdale's first signing since his side finished their League Two campaign.
Oyeleke played for Chelsea and QPR at youth level and has more recently had loan spells with Northampton, plus Conference clubs Aldershot and Woking.
"I was really happy that they were impressed enough that they wanted to sign me," he told Exeter's website.
"With the type of football that the manager wants to play and the history that the club has of producing young players and making them better players, I think the conditions are ideal for me to improve."
Oyeleke made 15 appearances in the Conference this season during his stints at Aldershot and Woking.
The signing comes after Exeter announced that their longest-serving player Liam Sercombe will leave the Devon side this summer.
