Zidane's son Enzo misses penalty and is sent off for Real Madrid reserves

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Zinedine Zidane's son Enzo missed a penalty and was sent off as Real Madrid reserves lost 2-1 to Athletic Bilbao B in Spain's third tier.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder, whose father manages Real, fired wide a 14th-minute spot-kick, before his dismissal in stoppage time for two yellow-card offences.
Enzo, 21, is the oldest of Zidane's four sons and scored on his first-team debut in the Copa del Rey in November.
He has not played for the senior side since, but is a reserve-team regular.
