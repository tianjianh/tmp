Slovakia v Scotland: Both sides smarting after Saturday - Andrew Robertson

Slovakia will entertain Scotland on Tuesday with both sides smarting from Saturday disappointments, according to left-back Andrew Robertson.

He does not think the hosts' hopes of reaching the World Cup finals would end with a third straight defeat against visitors who drew with Lithuania.
"I don't think anyone can be eliminated at this stage," said Robertson.
"We've got them next and they will be wanting to put that right, but we'll also want to put things right too."
While the Scots were drawing 1-1 at Hampden, Slovakia were losing 1-0 in Slovenia on the back of an opening defeat at home to England.
However, Robertson thinks it is too early to say whether either result will be significant as they vie with Gareth Southgate's group leaders for the automatic qualification spot.
"We won't know if it was a bad result or a good result or just a decent result until the end of the group," said Hull City full-back Robertson.
"You've seen Slovenia beating Slovakia, so we are still sitting on four points in second place and the second seeds have taken no points from two,"
Gordon Strachan's side rescued a point when James McArthur's late equaliser cancelled out Fedor Cernych's excellent second-half strike.
Robertson thought the Scots were unfortunate not to take all three points after a Grant Hanley header was cleared off the line in the dying seconds.
"We probably went a little more direct than we should have," he suggested. "We should have kept the ball moving because we were creating chances that way.
"But, luckily, James has popped up and got the header and then we've moved on and we've probably nearly nicked it at the end with big Grant's chance.
"I don't think they surprised us. The manager warned us all week that they are no mugs - they are a very good team.
"I thought they did play well. They had a shape behind the ball and it was difficult to break down and, when they went forward, they looked dangerous.
"They have hit us on the counter attack and it is an uphill battle from then, but luckily we got the goal in the end."
Robertson said his emotions were a mixture of frustration and relief.
"If you are at home and you draw then you are frustrated, but we can take a lot of heart from it because the boys stuck at the job in hand and we managed to get the goal when everything was against us," he added.
"The effort and endeavour was there, but we've missed a few chances when, on another night, we could have won comfortably."
