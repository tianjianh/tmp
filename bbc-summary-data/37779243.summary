[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On Friday, 28 October girls and women around Scotland will be heading to their local gyms, leisure centres and school halls to take part in Active Girls Day.

In association with Sport Scotland the aim is to celebrate all the amazing work that goes on to get girls active, as well as inspire more girls to participate in sport and physical activity.
Events will be hosted by clubs and schools and you can find out more on the Sport Scotland website.
Girls and women in Scotland are being encouraged to post photos on Twitter/Instagram. The pictures can be of themselves (or younger selves) playing sport, or of their female sporting role model. It is hoped that the word will spread across social media to get people talking about girls' sport.
If you would like to take part in this, all you have to do is share a photo alongside a bit about your own sporting experience, and use the hashtag #ActiveGirlsDay.
