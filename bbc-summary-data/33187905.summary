The first keys have been handed over to new homes built for troops moving from Germany to Stafford.

Just over 1,000 soldiers from two signals regiments and their families will be moving to Beacon Barracks.
Developer Lovell, based in nearby Tamworth, is building 346 homes on sites in the area.
They are expected to be completed at a rate of 15 a week, with the last ones handed over to the Ministry of Defence in September.
L/Cpl Richard Neely and his wife Rachel were the first to see inside their property and said the move would give them more "security" for the future.
"We're just looking for something more permanent now," Ms Neely said.
"This is our third move in two years. With a baby it's quite hard."
1st Armoured Division Signal Regiment and 16th Signal Regiment will join 22 Signal Regiment at Beacon Barracks as part of a wider shake-up of defence bases.
The Ministry of Defence plans to move 20,000 troops from bases in Germany to the UK between 2010 and 2020, ending a 70-year association with Germany.
