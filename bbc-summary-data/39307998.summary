Mr Hampshire died earlier this month, aged 76, after a long illness.
He was part of the Yorkshire team that won three successive County Championships between 1966 and 1968. He retired as a player in 1984.
As well as playing for the county and captaining it, he went on to appear for England before becoming a renowned international umpire.
The service took place a the Minster Church of All Saints and was attended by a number of past and present Yorkshire cricketers.
Ray Illingworth, who played alongside him in the championship team of the late 60s, described Mr Hampshire as a "Yorkshire great".
"A good man as well, he was a 100% team man," he said.
"He was a joy to be with. He enjoyed life did John, liked a pint afterwards."
