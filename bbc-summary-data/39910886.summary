Lokomotiv Moscow brought 43-year-old club legend Dmitri Loskov out of retirement for one final game - their Russian Premier League match against Orenburg.

After making a record 420 appearances for Lokomotiv, Loskov left in 2013 - his final appearance having come in an away cup match in September 2012.
But, after returning as assistant manager in the summer, he registered as a player in February with the aim of having a proper send-off in front of his own fans.
The capital club - who are safely in mid-table - advertised their match against Orenburg as the chance to "come and see a legend take to the pitch".
Former Russia playmaker Loskov, the second-oldest player to play in the league, captained the side and wore the number 10 shirt he had used in his two previous spells at the club.
Fans chanted his name for the opening 11 minutes, at which point he was replaced by Russia international Aleksei Miranchuk to a standing ovation. Loskov handed his shirt to his son on the touchline as he came off.
The club, in their first home game since winning the Russian Cup, won 4-0.
Loskov, the first player to play in 20 different Russian Premier League seasons, said: "My dream has come true.
"I was nervous - I hadn't played for such a long time. I want to thank the club's president, all the fans for their support and the chance to finish my career with one last match.
"Now I can hang up my boots and leave it to the kids."
