Glasgow School of Art: Inventory of fire damage made

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inventory of items which survived last year's fire at Glasgow School of Art has been produced following work by a team of forensic archaeologists.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Grade A-listed art nouveau Mackintosh building was badly damaged in the blaze on 23 May.
The majority of the paper artworks in the library, including 100 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, were unharmed.
Two of his oil paintings were among 90 works by artists including Newbery and Joan Eardley that were lost.
The art school confirmed that the majority of intricate pieces that made up the library's central light fitting had been found.
The three-month sifting operation also recovered parts of the original library chairs and periodicals desk.
About 8,000 rare books and journals were destroyed when flames engulfed the library.
However, the bulk of the rare book collection is housed in another building and was undamaged.
All of the salvaged material will now be carefully stored and reviewed by expert conservators as part of a recovery programme over the next three years.
An investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded the blaze was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
The report, released in November, said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector in Studio 19.
Glasgow School of Art is continuing with efforts to raise Â£20m towards the eventual cost of restoring the Mackintosh building and its contents.
