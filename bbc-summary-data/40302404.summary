The 21-year-old former England Under-19 international spent last season on loan at Crewe Alexandra, scoring seven goals in 34 League Two appearances.
"I know the club came in for me a couple of times last season but we couldn't get the deal done," Kiwomya told the club website.
"The manager sees me as an important part of his plans."
Kiwomya, who is the nephew of former Arsenal and Ipswich striker Chris Kiwomya, has been at Chelsea since he was 14 but failed to make a first-team appearance.
