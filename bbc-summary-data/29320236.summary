Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists he has "no concerns whatsoever" about Steven Gerrard.

The Reds captain struggled to make an impact in his side's 3-1 Premier League defeat at West Ham on Saturday.
Rodgers said: "He is a brilliant player for us. It was the team performance that wasn't up to scratch."
With games against Everton and FC Basel to come, Rodgers may decide to rest Gerrard for Tuesday's visit of Middlesbrough in the League Cup.
But the manager says the 34-year-old still has much to offer.
"I have no concerns about him," said Rodgers, whose side have lost three of their last five games. "We have managed his recovery really well in the last two seasons, even when Steven was playing international football.
"If you look at his numbers and games, it has been as good as ever.
"He is at the age where we need to treat him individually. We want him to be involved in the big games because of his experience and we will always taper that recovery to allow him to be at the very best he can be."
The Liverpool manager is likely to offer debuts to some of his most promising young players against Middlesbrough, with Jordan Rossiter and Sheyi Ojo set to feature.
