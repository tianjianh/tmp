Aruba profile

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tourist magnet and a fuel exporter, Aruba is an autonomous territory of the Netherlands and one of the most prosperous territories in the Caribbean.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century, Aruba lies 15 miles north of the coast of Venezuela. Away from the beaches, hotels and casinos, much of the island is desert-like but a strong indigenous heritage, colonisation and Latin American influence have given it a distinctive social and linguistic character.
A gold rush in the 1820s triggered an economic boom, with a petroleum refinery opening a century later. Its temporary closure in 1985 sparked an economic crisis and Aruba has since invested in tourism which is its economic mainstay.
Aruba is susceptible to drug smuggling and illegal immigration but has passed laws to combat money-laundering.
In 1986 Aruba pulled out of the Netherlands Antilles - a federation of Dutch Caribbean territories - and obtained separate status within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Dutch government controls defence and foreign affairs while the island's government handles local matters.

Mike Eman was sworn in as prime minister of Aruba for a second term on 30 October 2013, following the parliamentary election win by his Aruba People's Party (AVP) on 27 September 2013.
He first became prime minister in October 2009 after the AVP won parliamentary elections, defeating the centre-left People's Electoral Movement of Nelson Orlando Oduber, who had been prime minister since 2001.
