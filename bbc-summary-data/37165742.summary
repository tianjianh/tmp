[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rugby league star Roger Millward road name idea floated

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A road in Hull could be named in honour of rugby league legend Roger Millward, who died in May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Garrison Road would be renamed Roger Millward Way in the proposal supported by the leader of Hull City Council and rugby league club Hull KR.
Millward made 406 appearances for the club, scoring a record 207 tries and kicking 607 goals.
He was awarded the MBE for his services to the sport in 1983 and inducted into the Rugby League Hall of Fame in 2000.
After his retirement from playing, he coached the Robins for 11 seasons, winning six trophies.
Rugby league supporters and councillors had called for a tribute for the player who died at the age of 68 on 2 May.
The A63, as it enters the city, is named Clive Sullivan Way to honour another late rugby league star who played for both Hull FC and Hull KR.
After crossing the River Hull, it currently is called Garrison Road for a stretch into east Hull.
Councillor Stephen Brady, leader of the council, said it was a fitting tribute for a man who had a "huge influence on rugby and was an honoured citizen of Hull for many years".
Neil Hudgell, chairman of Hull KR, said Mr Millward was a "significant part of the rich rugby heritage in this city".
The proposal for re-naming is to be discussed at a future meeting.
