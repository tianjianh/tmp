Kevin Wright: Widnes carpet crush death 'accidental'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was crushed at a recycling plant by a falling bale of carpet was killed accidentally, an inquest concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Wright died after he became trapped at Fresco Environmental Ltd in Widnes, Cheshire, on 1 March, 2016.
The jury at Warrington Coroner's Court said "systems of storage" at the depot "contributed" to the 27-year-old's death.
The company declined to comment on the inquest's findings.
Workmate Stephen Maloney had earlier told the hearing he had heard a loud bang.
He described how his colleague was "holding onto my leg saying 'help me mate, help me'."
"I just tried to keep him stable I just tried to keep him going," he added.
The jury reached an accidental conclusion on Mr Wright's death.
It added: "It is more likely than not that the systems of storage and the movement of carpet bales contributed to the death."
A Health and Safety Executive spokesman said its investigation into Mr Wright's death was ongoing.
