Fines possible for people who do not recycle waste

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stronger powers to fine people for not recycling may be the only way to hit a zero landfill waste target by 2050, the body representing Welsh councils said.

Andrew Morgan, from the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) acknowledged the move "would not be popular with some".
But the Welsh government said it would be happy to discuss the plan.
Wales recycles 54.3% of waste with provisional figures for 2013/14 due to be released on Thursday.
Mr Morgan, the WLGA's environment spokesman and also the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, added plenty of work was being carried out to educate people about recycling.
"Our team go and knock on their door and speak to them - maybe just encourage them to recycle paper - get into the habit of doing somethingâ€¦ doing it slowly and showing people that it isn't that difficult to do," he said.
"There is still a small minority who simply won't recycle even when they've been spoken to two or three times they just simply say 'no'.
"Potentially in future I think local government could well be asking for powers to issue fines if the Welsh government wants us to hit targets."
Councils face fines if they do not meet Welsh government targets. The recycling target for 2015/16 is 58% but will rise to 100% by 2050.
England, Scotland and Northern Ireland recycle about 45% while the European target is 50%.
A Welsh government spokesman said: "Local authorities already have powers to require householders to put recyclable waste into the right containers and householders may be fined if they fail to do this.
"However, we would be happy to discuss this further with local authorities to see if there is a need to provide stronger powers."
Phil Hurst of Wastesavers, which collects rubbish in Newport, said options for throwing items in general waste bins need to be restricted.
He added: "I think plastic bags and crisp packets will be an issue for some time. Disposable nappies are also an issue. Almost everything else can be recycled in Newport."
Caerphilly-based DS Smith Recycling collects 5.4 million tonnes of paper and cardboard each year from across Wales and Europe. General manager Peter Clayson said while zero waste is ambitious, it is possible.
Wrexham council said plastic bottles prove the greatest challenge while Conwy council called for every manufactured product to be recyclable.
Hazel Evans, cabinet member for environment at Carmarthenshire council, said it is "difficult to predict" if zero waste is achievable.
