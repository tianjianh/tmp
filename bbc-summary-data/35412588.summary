The 27-year-old has signed a three-and-half-year contract and is the third Rams signing of the transfer window.
Olsson will provide competition for veteran defender Stephen Warnock, who has been first choice following a season-ending injury to Craig Forsyth.
Head coach Paul Clement said Derby had been looking at Olsson for "some time".
"I am very pleased that we have now completed the deal," Clement told the club website.
"Stephen Warnock has done fantastically for us in the last few months but we felt it was important to have another specialist in that position in the squad, as well as being at a perfect age to develop with us.
"Craig Forsyth and Max Lowe are both going to miss the rest of the season due to injury, so we felt it was important to avoid any issues further down the line."
Olsson joined Blackburn in 2012 and has won two full international caps.
Derby have already signed striker Nick Blackman from Reading and Guinea international Abdoul Camara in the January window.
