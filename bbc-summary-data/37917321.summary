While Trump supporters celebrate on social media, his detractors have been licking each others' wounds using the hashtag "#AmericaIsOverParty".
But amid the wild celebration and gallows humour, some people are also genuinely worried about what the prospect of a Trump presidency would hold in store for them.
Instagram user and trans activist graysonpapp used the photo-sharing site to speak about their fear of a Trump victory.
"Pretty scared right now, I won't lie," they wrote.
"I've never been scared over an election before.
"I sit here in bed crying for not only my rights but for all my brothers and sisters' rights, women's rights, LGBTQ rights.
"This can't be real."
Writing on Facebook,, vlogger Kat Blaque wa equally upset.
"This election confirmed something I really didn't want to believe," she wrote.
"We haven't progressed at all.
"Obama was the fall guy. He was the minority candidate that everyone could blame and they will continue to blame for decades."
Several celebrities have also been quick to express shock and concern, including actors Rashida Jones and Kunal Nayyar.
