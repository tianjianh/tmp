Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock admits defender Bruno Manga could leave the Championship club at the end of the season.

Manga, 28, joined Cardiff in September 2014 from French club Lorient on a three-year deal and has played over 70 games.
The Gabon international has been asked to take a pay cut to remain at the club and Warnock is pessimistic.
"I can't see Bruno staying," Warnock said.
"I haven't given up hope of signing him I just think it will be very difficult with his agent.
"His agent was supposed to come last week but he didn't turn up and they're not making any overtures they want to stay.
"I think we will regret it if he leaves."
Manga, 28, played in Cardiff's 1-0 defeat at Championship play-off hopefuls Sheffield Wednesday on Good Friday.
Warnock was disappointed with the result which saw them remain 14th in the table.
"I don't know how they've come away with a win if I'm honest. It's really baffling me," Warnock said.
"In the end they were the long ball merchants and I thought we tried to play some controlled stuff in the second half.
"We couldn't get that goal and when we needed bravery at the end we didn't get it and we've ended up losing and a long trek back."
