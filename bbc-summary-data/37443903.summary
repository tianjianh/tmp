South of Scotland golden eagle project views sought

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A project aiming to boost the number of golden eagles in southern Scotland is seeking views on the scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project has secured more than Â£1m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and has Scottish government backing.
It aims to increase bird numbers in Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders to possibly 16 nesting pairs.
Public meetings are being staged in Peebles, Selkirk and Moffat to discuss the proposals.
The project could see eagle chicks raised and released in the Moffat hills and various locations in the Scottish Borders.
An online survey has already been launched.
"We'd like to hear from as many people as possible," said Cat Barlow, project manager at the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project.
"We think this project is incredibly exciting.
"A revived population of golden eagles offers great opportunities for tourism and wider benefits for people and nature in the south of Scotland."
Presentations at the public events will explain what is proposed and look at the successes of similar schemes elsewhere in the country.
The events are being co-ordinated by the Southern Uplands Partnership which specialises in developing and implementing community and environmental projects across the south of Scotland.
Their project manager Pip Tabor said: "There will be a number of speakers and presentations at the evening events, whilst the drop-ins are for those who are unable to attend the main meetings.
"We plan to have a range of information to hand out.
"We really would encourage anyone with an interest to come along."
The venues for the public meetings are:
Drop-in sessions at each meeting are from 15:00 to 18:00 followed by the main meeting from 19:00 to 21:00.
