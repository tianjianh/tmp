[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Camelot put out an appeal after the winner of the Lotto Millionaire Raffle, who bought their ticket in Denbighshire, had not come forward.
The mystery ticket holder matched the draw number AQUA 6323 7030 on 1 April.
Andy Carter, from the National Lottery, said: "It would have been awful if the ticket holder had missed out on this substantial and life-changing amount of money."
Lottery winners are given 180 days from the date of the draw to come forward and claim their prize.
After this time, the money is given to good causes.
