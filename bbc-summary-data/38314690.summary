The 26-year-old was out of contract at the end of the season but his new deal ties him to the club until 2019.
Former Exeter trainee Norwood moved to Rovers from Forest Green in July 2015 and has netted 30 goals since then.
"I've enjoyed playing here for the last year or so and the fans have been great to me, so it didn't take long to agree a new deal," he told the club website.
