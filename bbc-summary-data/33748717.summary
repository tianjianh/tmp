Cooke acquired Thompson Bros Salmon Ltd, located on the island of Yell, in a share deal for an undisclosed sum.
The move will add two new farms to Cooke Aquaculture Scotland's current operations.
The new sites are located next to Cooke's existing facilities at Unst and Yell.
Cooke chief executive Glenn Cooke said: "After this transaction, Cooke will own all of the salmon farms in the area.
"That will allow us to coordinate management for the entire area and enhance our ability to meet a growing demand for our products."
The combined business is expected to raise Cooke's total harvest in Scotland next year to 22,500 tonnes of whole fish.
Last year, Cooke bought salmon farm operators Meridian, which has bases in Shetland, Orkney and the Scottish mainland.
Cooke already runs operations in New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Maine, Chile and Spain.
