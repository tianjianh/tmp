Comedian Dapper Laughs has apologised after songs on his Christmas album were branded "sexist and offensive to homeless people".

Earlier this week Shelter rejected donations from the star, saying they felt they had to take a stand.
In a statement the comedian said: "I think it's important that if we overstep the mark and cause upset that we apologise.
"I'd like to say sorry to those people who I have upset by my comments."
Daniel O'Reilly became well known on the video-sharing app Vine before being handed a show, Dapper Laughs, on ITV2.
But his lad culture-style comedy has been criticised and plans to donate part of the proceeds of his new Christmas album to the homeless were turned down by Shelter.
One song on his album is called A Walk To The Pub... With A Tramp while another is called Proper Moist.
On Twitter he's sent posts including: "Just gave my number to a homeless woman (cracking boobs tho, not sure if her top was low cut or just ripped) closed with: your place or mine?"
His Christmas album has been posted on Spotify, where artists are thought to make around half a penny every time a song is played.
Shelter has started to receive donations from supporters who agree with the charity's decision to reject any money raised.
The charity's CEO Campbell Robb said in a statement: "The fact that 90,000 children will wake up homeless this Christmas is no joke.
"Dapper Laughs's brand of 'comedy' - which is deeply offensive about homeless people, not to mention many others - is something we felt it was important to take a stand against.
"The support from the public has been overwhelming and we've seen a fantastic rise in donations as a result, meaning Shelter can help even more people this Christmas."
The comedian was recently forced to call off his tour of Wales after nearly 1,000 people signed a petition demanding Cardiff University Student's Union cancel a performance because of its "sexist and inappropriate" content.
His Vine channel has had 144 million views, he has 1.7 million followers on Facebook and another 362,000 on Twitter.
There's also a petition online trying to get his TV show cancelled.
An ITV spokesman said about the ITV2 show: "Dapper Laughs: On The Pull features an established internet comedy character created by Daniel O'Reilly.
"ITV2 commissioned a show in which this character is placed within a recognisable TV format, a dating advice show.
"Comedy is subjective and we realise the content of the show might not be to everyone's taste.
"We regret that any of our viewers were offended.
"However, as with all of our shows, the series content was carefully considered, complied and deemed suitable for broadcast."
