The 20-year-old scored 13 goals in 60 games for the Cobblers before his move to Newcastle and was recently on loan at Shrewsbury.
"We have done whatever we can to bring Ivan back to the club," said Thomas.
"He has returned to Newcastle United from his loan spell at Shrewsbury Town and the decision is now with him."
Since moving to St James' Park in August 2015, Toney has made four first-team appearances as well as having loan spells at Barnsley and Shrewsbury.
Last season, he helped the Tykes win promotion to the Championship, playing in the League One play-off final victory over Millwall.
