Mark Hughes: Stoke manager fined £8,000 by Football Association

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Stoke boss Mark Hughes has been fined £8,000 by the Football Association after being sent off during his side's 4-0 loss at home to Tottenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Hughes was dismissed for reacting angrily to the decision to book Stoke forward Marko Arnautovic for diving during the defeat on the 10 September.
The 52-year-old Welshman was subsequently charged by the FA.
He said he would not contest the charge as it would cost money he would prefer to give to his grandchildren.
Stoke, who are currently bottom of the Premier League, say they want to speak to the FA about a "potentially inconsistent approach" from match officials following the charge against Hughes.
