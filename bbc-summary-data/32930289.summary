A man has been detained for killing his cellmate who was serving a nine-month sentence for voyeurism offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Alan Goode, 73, of Wigston, Leicester, was jailed on 17 October 2013, after he was found lying on a cubicle floor in women's toilets.
He was discovered dead in the cell he shared with Krzysztof Mroz at HMP Lincoln, on 31 October.
Mroz, 36, was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act after a four-day trial at Stafford Crown Court.
He was convicted of manslaughter with diminished responsibility.
A post-mortem examination found Mr Goode died from head injuries.
Mroz was originally charged with murder but during the course of the trial, jurors heard from medical experts that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack.
The court was told that although he was responsible for Mr Goode's death, he had been affected by an "abnormality in mental functioning".
After the case, Det Insp Helen Evans, of Lincolnshire Police, said: "I am satisfied with both the jury's verdict and the judge's ruling because this is an appropriate outcome in this case, which has been truly tragic for all involved.
"He will be detained in a secure establishment where he will not be a danger to anyone else and will also be given the treatment he needs."
