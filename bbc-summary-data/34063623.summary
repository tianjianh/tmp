A DIY enthusiast has told how he dug up a hand grenade in his garden before "lobbing" it across his lawn and hiding in his house in fear of his life.

Graham Palmer unearthed the unexploded British Army grenade in Gunthorpe, Peterborough, while digging a drainage trench with a pick axe.
He said bomb experts told him the relic once had a 20-metre (66ft) "kill zone".
"I didn't know what to do with it, so I lobbed it and took cover in the conservatory," said Mr Palmer.
He uncovered the explosive on Saturday after striking some surrounding stones while working in his back garden.
After prising the metal object out of the ground, he said it immediately reminded him of his old toy Action Man grenades.
He decided to launch it across his back garden and take shelter but when nothing happened after "three or four minutes", Mr Palmer alerted police.
RAF Wittering Bomb disposal experts arrived and identified it as a Mills grenade, used by the British Army between 1915 and 1972, but could not date it more accurately owing to its condition.
Mr Palmer said they told him some "terrifying facts" given that he had levered it out of the ground minutes before.
He said: "There is a kill zone on these things of 20-30m (66-98ft), with a maiming zone of 50m (164ft), and there's me sitting on the deckchair no more than 15m (49ft) away having a cup of tea."
The grenade was X-rayed before being detonated elsewhere.
An RAF Wittering spokesman said: "If a member of the public ever finds something of this nature we would urge them not to attempt to touch it or move it.
"They must call the police straight away."
Cambridgeshire Police said it was not known how the device ended up in the garden but it was "non-suspicious".
