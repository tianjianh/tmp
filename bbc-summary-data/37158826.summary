West Ham failed to reach the Europa League group stage as Astra Giurgiu knocked them out in the qualifying round for the second year in a row.

After a 1-1 away draw last week, West Ham went behind when Filipe Teixeira precisely finished a swift counter-attack by the Romanian champions.
After the break West Ham's Jonathan Calleri and Winston Reid missed good chances and Ashley Fletcher went close.
But West Ham could not avoid a first competitive loss at the London Stadium.
"The disappointment is massive," said Hammers manager Slaven Bilic.
"We didn't play good in the first half or with desire as a team. We were second best."
Hammers boss Bilic had stressed the importance of "getting the job done" and reaching the Europa League group stage after starting their qualifying campaign back in late July.
But they could not break down a stubborn Astra side, who have only won once in five league games this season but went through on Thursday by converting one of just two shots they had on target.
In contrast, the Hammers had 17 unsuccessful attempts at goal - again highlighting Bilic's need for attacking reinforcements.
The Croat says he is interested in signing Manchester City forward Wilfried Bony, but will not "beg" anyone to join the club.
Bilic freshened up his side again, making eight changes from the starting XI which beat Premier League rivals Bournemouth at the weekend.
However, he had few attacking options to choose from, with Dimitri Payet, Andy Carroll, Manuel Lanzini and Andre Ayew all out injured.
As a result his team did not provide enough creativity and attacking threat against a side many expected them to beat.
Argentine striker Calleri missed two golden chances, one either side of the break, with only Fletcher - a young forward signed from Manchester United this summer - providing real spark when he came on shortly after the hour mark.
The Hammers' exit from Europe's secondary club competition leaves Manchester United and Southampton as the only English sides in Friday's draw.
Both teams moved directly into the group stage after finishing fifth and sixth in the Premier League last season, above seventh-placed West Ham.
Italian giants Inter Milan, Dutch runners-up Ajax and Spanish side Athletic Bilbao are all potential opponents for the English pair, along with Dundalk, who fell short of becoming the first Irish team to reach the Champions League group stage.
The draw takes place at 12:00 BST on Friday.
West Ham are left to focus solely on their domestic season. Next up is a Premier League trip to Manchester City, who have won both of their opening matches, on Sunday (16:00 BST).
