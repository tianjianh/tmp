The 28-year-old Czech Republic international has three caps and had been on trial with the Tigers.
He could make his competitive debut against Aston Villa on Saturday, 5 August.
"Of course I am very happy to sign the contract with Hull because it has always been my dream to play in England," he told the club website.
The centre-back has been with Hull during their pre-season training camp in Portugal and played in their 1-0 friendly win over Benfica.
Hull have also paid Shrewsbury an undisclosed fee for 20-year-old goalkeeper Callum Burton, who has signed a one-year deal with the option of a further year.
Burton will initially be part of Hull's development squad.
