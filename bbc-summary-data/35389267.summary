[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town 2-3 Cardiff City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City earned back-to-back away wins for the first time this season as Peter Whittingham's brace completed a league double over Huddersfield Town.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After a dour start, Cardiff led through Whittingham's neat finish, before Nahki Wells fired Huddersfield level.
Loanee Lex Immers, making his first Cardiff start, restored their lead before Whittingham's stunning free-kick made the points safe.
Harry Bunn smashed in a consolation for the hosts in second-half stoppage time.
Defeat brought the Terriers' five-match unbeaten home run in all competitions to an end.
Whittingham's opener brought the game time to life as he swept home Anthony Pilkington's cut-back, before Wells' low effort made it 1-1 before half-time.
Dutchman Immers, who arrived on loan from Feyernoord earlier this month, finished off a fine team move after the break as Cardiff improved.
Whittingham sealed the win direct from a free-kick with a superb finish, before Wells fed Bunn to give the Bluebirds a late scare in the closing stages, but the Welsh side held on.
Huddersfield, who were without suspended defensive duo Mark Hudson and Tommy Smith, struggled to create openings and remain 17th in the Championship.
Victory lifted Cardiff to within one point of eighth-placed play-off hopefuls Ipswich Town, who do not play until Tuesday.
