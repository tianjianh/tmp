[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland Bill due to be published

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Legislation giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament is due to begin its journey through Westminster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Scotland Bill, outlined in the Queen's Speech, could become law by February 2016 if approved by MPs.
David Cameron said the legislation would make Scotland the most powerful devolved assembly anywhere in the world.
But the SNP have said it does not meet the recommendations of the Smith Commission.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell will lay the Scotland Bill before the House of Commons, with discussions on the principles of the legislation due to take place next month.
If it passes the usual parliamentary hurdles it could become law early next year, ahead of the Holyrood elections in May 2016.
The UK government said the new bill would embody the Smith Commission agreement which was signed by the SNP, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Greens in November last year.
The promise of more powers to Holyrood followed voters rejecting Scottish independence by 55% to 45% in last September's referendum.
The key elements of the Scotland Bill include:
Before the Queen's Speech, SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted the Scotland Bill to go much further than the Smith proposals.
She had been keen to see Holyrood given full control over National Insurance, the minimum wage, Corporation Tax, full control of welfare and employment and trade union law.
However, the Bill does not contain any of those demands.
A new Scotland Bill will be based on recommendations made by the Smith Commission - the cross-party group formed after the independence referendum to look at what additional powers might be handed to Scotland.
