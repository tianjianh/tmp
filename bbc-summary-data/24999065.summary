[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
G&J Jack is blaming fish landing quotas and a general downturn in the industry for the decision.
It will shut by the end of the year, following unsuccessful attempts to sell the company.
The company was described as "one of Scotland's most respected and successful fish processing companies".
A statement said: "For four generations, G&J Jack has been delivering high quality fish to customers throughout Europe.
"However, the decline in the industry has been significant over the last two decades, with the white fish sector in which G&J Jack operates being affected by reduced fish stocks and quota availability.
"The Jack family, who own and operate the company, have tried various strategies in order to sustain long-term trading and safeguard the workforce.
"Attempts to sell the business as a going concern have not proved successful, despite recent interest.
"It is regretted that all staff will be made redundant."
Chartered Accountants Meston Reid have been dealing with the closure proceedings.
