George Michael Swindells was swimming off the Mediterranean island of Elba when the incident happened on Tuesday.
Local news reports suggest the 85-year-old, from Wiltshire, suffered a medical problem about 300ft from land, and died despite rescue efforts by two German tourists and a passing policeman.
The Foreign Office confirmed the death of a UK national and said it was "providing assistance to the family".
Mr Swindells, who was reportedly visiting Elba with his wife and friends, drowned at about 15:30 local time on Tuesday.
