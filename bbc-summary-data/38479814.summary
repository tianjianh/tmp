Boateng, 20, made his Premier League debut for Palace as a substitute in a 1-1 draw with Swansea in February.
Ex-Rangers player Wylde, 25, joined Millwall in the summer but has only made five appearances in League One.
Meanwhile, Northampton have terminated the contract of 30-year-old midfielder Joel Byrom, who has joined Mansfield.
"He (Boateng) is a player we have tracked for a while and we tried to bring him in last summer. He has impressed at both Plymouth and Bristol Rovers and we have done well to get him," said Cobblers boss Rob Page.
"Gregg has pace to burn and that is a quality that frightens defenders. He can also deliver a ball with quality, and with the strikers we have they will benefit from that service."
Wylde and Boateng will be available for Northampton's League One match against Bradford on 2 January.
