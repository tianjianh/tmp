[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reading 1-1 Fulham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lucas Piazon scored against his former club to snatch 10-man Fulham a share of the points in a draw against Reading.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Brazilian midfielder pounced on a loose Joey van den Berg backpass for the equaliser seven minutes from time.
Liam Kelly had netted his third goal in two games to give Reading the lead from the edge of the box on the hour mark.
Fulham earlier had a nightmare start when centre-back Tomas Kalas was sent off for a foul on Reading striker Mo Barrow, only 39 seconds into the game.
In a repeat of last season's Championship play-off semi-final, Kalas' bad luck at the Madejski Stadium continued.
The 24-year-old's handball in the second leg of that tie in May gave away a penalty and Reading eventually won 2-1 on aggregate.
But Slavisa Jokanovic's side here denied Reading a first league win of the season despite playing the majority of the game a man down.
The Royals were unable to add to Kelly's strike, which followed a midweek brace against Gillingham in the EFL Cup first round, as David Button made a string of fine saves.
Fulham have drawn their opening two league games 1-1 while Reading, who finished third last season, have lost one and drawn one.
Reading manager Jaap Stam:
"Disappointed? You can say that again.
"We needed to be patient and wait for that moment. Even when the opponents have only 10, it's not a guarantee that you will create loads of opportunities.
"We got the goal in the second-half and went for a second. But it didn't happen and then we gave away the equaliser."
Fulham manager Slavisa Jokanovic:
"It's a great result in a very complicated situation, it was not easy for us to play without one player after half a minute.
"The team showed tactical ability, they defended very well, we stuck together and were organised.
"They scored the first goal but we caught them making one mistake. That was a priceless point for us."
