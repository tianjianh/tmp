[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Corofin produced a superb display to outclass Slaughtneil on a 1-14 to 0-7 scoreline in the All-Ireland Club Football Final at Croke Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Slaughtneil's Christopher Bradley hit the first point but Corofin took total control as Martin Farragher's goal helped them into a 1-6 to 0-2 lead.
After trailing 1-8 to 0-3 at half-time, Slaughtneil never got closer than seven in arrears in the second half.
Cormac O'Doherty's late missed penalty summed up a dismal day for Slaughtneil.
The Derry and Ulster champions were never able to get to grips with man of the match, Michael Lundy who proved a brilliant target man for the Galway side.
Corofin were able to produce a potent mix of running football and the long game which a sluggish Slaughtneil side simply couldn't handle.

Slaughtneil may point to a controversial early refereeing decision by Meath whistler after Paul Bradley appeared to be upended by a Corofin defender.
That decision came immediately after Christopher Bradley's opening score and a potential four-point lead was quickly reduced to nought after Gary Sice levelled after dispossessing Francis McEldowney.
Chrissy McKaigue restored Slaughtneil's advantage in the eighth minute but Corofin responded with an unanswered 1-5 which included Farragher's 20th-minute goal.
Three of those scores came from Lundy who was proving hugely ineffective in the air and over the ground.
Bradley scored Slaughtneil's first point in 16 minutes in the 24th minute but Corofin replied with two further points before half-time with Anton McMullan having to make a magnificent save to prevent a second goal for the Connacht champions.
Eight in arrears at the break, Slaughtneil needed a fast start to the second half but after Padraig Kelly did notch a free, scores from Sice and Ronan Steed effectively closed the door on any possible comeback.
Corofin were able to play keep ball for large sections of the closing 20 minutes as both managements emptied their benches.
Right at the death, referee Coldrick did award Slaughtneil a questionable penalty after O'Doherty tumbled in the large square but the Derryman's spot-kick went way wide to sum up the Derry club's day.
