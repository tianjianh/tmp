The tomb was found in Abu-Sir, south-west of Cairo, and is thought to belong to the wife or mother of Pharaoh Neferefre who ruled 4,500 years ago.
Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh el-Damaty said that her name, Khentakawess, had been found inscribed on a wall in the necropolis.
Mr Damaty added that this would make her Khentakawess III.
The tomb was discovered in Pharaoh Neferefre's funeral complex.
Miroslav Barta, head of the Czech Institute of Egyptology mission which made the discovery, said that the location of the queen's tomb made them believe that she was the wife of the pharaoh.
The Czech archaeologists also found about 30 utensils made of limestone and copper.
Mr Damaty explained that the discovery would "help us shed light on certain unknown aspects of the Fifth Dynasty, which along with the Fourth Dynasty, witnessed the construction of the first pyramids."
Abu-Sir was used as an Old Kingdom cemetery for the ancient Egyptian capital of Memphis.
