Former Israeli President Shimon Peres has undergone a "successful minor surgery" after suffering small heart attack, officials have said.

Mr Peres, 92, was treated for a constricted artery that had caused chest pain, his spokesman Ayelet Frisch said.
The veteran politician is said to be "conscious and in stable condition" in hospital in Tel Aviv.
Mr Peres twice served as prime minister and was president from 2007 to 2014.
His personal physician Raphi Walden said he was expected to stay in the Tel Hashomer hospital for "a few days".
Mr Peres won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for his role negotiating the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians a year earlier, a prize he shared with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was later assassinated, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
He was defeated in the 1996 election by the head of the opposition Likud, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Mr Peres has held almost every major political office since Israel was founded in 1948, and was the architect of Israel's secret nuclear programme in 1959.
Despite his age, Mr Peres has maintained an active public schedule, mostly through his non-governmental Peres Centre for Peace, which promotes closer ties between Israel and the Palestinians.
