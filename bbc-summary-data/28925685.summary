Mother-of-two Rukshana Miah, 35, was found critically injured in Longford Road West, Stockport, Greater Manchester, on August 18.
She died in hospital on Saturday. Post-mortem tests showed she had suffered fatal compression to the neck.
Mrs Miah's husband, Abdul Kashem Miah, was initially charged with her attempted murder.
The 36-year-old, of Florist Street, Shaw Heath, appeared at Stockport Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, but Greater Manchester Police said the charge against him would now be reviewed.
In a statement, Mrs Miah's family said: "Rukshana was a wonderful daughter, mother, sister, aunty, cousin and friend that will be greatly missed by us all."
Des Howlett, head teacher at Broadoak Primary School in Ashton-under-Lyne, Tameside, described Mrs Miah as "a wonderful and talented teacher."
He said: "Rukshana was the heart of the school, an outstanding teacher who was devoted to the success of the children that she taught.
"She always wanted to be the best and for her children to be the best and her belief that anything was possible if you work hard enough had an impact on everyone she met.
"Her loss is absolutely devastating. Ruk was the best of us and will always be remembered.  Our thoughts are with Ruk's children and family at this terrible time."
A statement on the school's website also paid tribute to the Year 6 teacher, and invited parents to sign a book of condolences.
