Rugby fans flocked to see and take pictures of the "ball in the wall" when the city hosted eight games during the tournament, which ended at the weekend.
New Zealand beat Australia in Saturday's final at Twickenham.
The ball appeared in the castle wall on the eve of the World Cup as a surprise and was finally taken down during the early hours of Tuesday.
