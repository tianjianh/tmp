[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leinster scored six tries in a convincing bonus-point win over Treviso at Stadio di Monigo to consolidate their third position in the Pro12.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two tries from Dave Kearney and one from Rory O'Loughlin helped the Irish province to a 21-7 half-time lead.
Adam Byrne, Joey Carbery and Bryan Byrne added second-half touchdowns, with Ross Byrne converting five tries.
Robert Barbieri and Andrea Pratichetti crossed for Treviso, with Ian McKinley adding the extras on both occasions.
The match marked the return to action of winger Kearney, fly-half Carbery and prop Ross after injuries.
Kearney started his first game since suffering an ankle injury in October and was named man of the match after scoring two first-half tries.
Carbery, missing since suffering an ankle injury in a Champions Cup game with Northampton in December, ran in a try after being introduced from the replacements' bench.
Ross, out with a hamstring problem since November, was also called from the bench in the second half.
With 11 players away on international duty, Treviso's much-changed line-up could not have asked for a worse start as they conceded a try with less than two minutes played - Ross Byrne cleverly dinking over the top following a line-out for O'Loughlin to collect and slide over.
The Italians enjoyed a period of dominance but then Dominic Ryan made an initial break in midfield and the ball was worked wide for Kearney to score.
And 14-0 became 21-0 shortly after after as Kearney again went over in the corner.
To their credit, Treviso got on the board before half-time as Barbieri barrelled his way across the line to narrow the deficit to 14 points at the break.
A scrappy start to the second period was ended on 50 minutes as Adam Byrne notched the bonus-point try, when a solid scrum set the platform for the ball to be spread through the hands and the 22-year-old finished the move.
Pratichetti dotted down for a nicely-worked try shortly after but visiting fly-half Carbery burrowed over the whitewash with 15 minutes remaining.
And there was still time for Bryan Byrne to grab a sixth try for Leinster as he benefitted from an inexorable driving maul to complete a triumph that narrowed the gap on second-placed Ospreys to three points and leaders Munster to four points.
