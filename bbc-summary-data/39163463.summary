Colchester United 0-4 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Portsmouth boosted their hopes of automatic promotion from League Two with a hugely impressive win at play-off chasers Colchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Eoin Doyle headed Pompey into a first-half lead before Kyle Bennett, Danny Rose and Michael Doyle added further goals in the second period.
Colchester goalkeeper Sam Walker denied Kai Naismith and Enda Stevens early on, before George Elokobi nodded U's team-mate Matt Briggs' attempted clearance away from near his own goal-line.
But Portsmouth took a 22nd-minute lead through Eoin Doyle, who dived to head home from close range following Naismith's delivery.
The goalscorer ballooned over just before half-time but Portsmouth did go 2-0 up with the second half just 37 seconds old when Bennett converted Naismith's pass from close range, after Colchester had failed to clear their lines.
Stevens' deflected left-foot effort whistled inches wide of the far post before Pompey went further ahead on the hour when Rose scored at the second attempt after Walker had saved his initial effort, following Eoin Doyle's through ball.
And it was 4-0 with 17 minutes remaining when Michael Doyle converted after Walker had saved Naismith's effort following a devastating counter-attack.
