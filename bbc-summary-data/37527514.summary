[SN]TITLE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers 2-0 Wrexham

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mickey Mellon saw Tranmere win the first game of his reign with a bizarre own goal by Wrexham goalkeeper Shwan Jalal helping their cause.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Curtis Tilt collided with Jalal as the keeper gathered a cross and the latter lost control for the ball to bounce over the line.
Andy Cook fired in from just inside the box three minutes into added time.
It was Tranmere's eighth league win of the season and Wrexham's sixth defeat under Gary Mills.
Wrexham boss Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "I thought the lads did well. We had a good shape and we worked hard, but we are struggling up-front. We didn't look like scoring again.
"It took a mistake for them to maybe go on and win the game because, forget the second goal, that doesn't happen if it's 0-0.  It's our defender and goalkeeper who have made the mistake unfortunately, but these things happen.  We are not pointing fingers at them, we stick together."
