Barbie, the iconic plastic toy doll model, is getting three new body types this year.

The US company behind the famous toy, Mattel, is adding "tall, curvy and petite" body shapes to its line-up of the fashion dolls.
Several skin tones, eye colours and hair styles will also be added to the collection, the company said.
Barbie's figure has come under fire for years, with critics arguing it set an unrealistic body image for girls.
With the new body shapes, the toy makers say they are "offering girls choices that are more reflective of the world they see today".
Last year, the company introduced 23 new dolls to its so-called Fashionistas line with varied skin and hair colours, and a much touted flat foot - replacing Barbie's signature heels.
With this year's update, the Barbie Fashionistas line will feature:
"We are excited to literally be changing the face of the brand - these new dolls represent a line that is more reflective of the world girls see around them - the variety in body type, skin tones and style allows girls to find a doll that speaks to them," Mattel executive Evelyn Mazzocco said in a statement.
Some took to Twitter to hail the move:
Others questioned light-heartedly when the same would happen for Ken, the fictional toy boyfriend of Barbie.
The new dolls will go on sale in the spring of 2016 worldwide.
However, true to life, Mattel warned that "not all clothes will fit all dolls".
Barbie Millicent Roberts is a woman with a very controversial reputation and mostly it stems from her long legs, tiny waist, ample bosom, slender neck and flowing blonde locks.
Some argue her body shape would be unobtainable and unsustainable if scaled up to life-size. They claim she would not be able to stand up because her body frame would be so unbalanced. A real life Barbie would simply fall over.
