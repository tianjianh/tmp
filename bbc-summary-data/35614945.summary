Thirteen fire engines are likely to be removed permanently from the capital in a drive to cut cost, says City Hall.

The Mayor of London's office said the potential move followed "record low" numbers of fires and related deaths in the capital.
Removing the engines, out of use for more than two years, could save Â£8.1m from the 2016/1017 budget.
London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it had received a letter from the mayor and would respond in due course.
The engines are likely to be cut from service after a public consultation in which 70% of 1,478 respondents - including members of the public and LFB staff - voted to maintain the number of engines and fire stations in the capital.
A spokesperson for London Mayor Boris Johnson said the engines had been held back for two-and-a-half years and in that time, response times had "continued to be comfortably met".
She added: "The savings achieved by their permanent removal would allow more money to be invested in frontline officers and help fund vital long term work to continue reducing the number of fires and deaths in the capital for many years to come."
Mr Johnson is to direct the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) to follow earlier recommendations by the Fire Commissioner and start to make an official plan to implement the cuts.
LFB, which has been asked to make a total of Â£11.5m savings for the coming financial year, said it would respond to the mayor via the LFEPA.
