Newport County rescued a point against Barnet thanks to Sean Rigg's late penalty.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Exiles led at half time through Ben Tozer's header as they chased a first win under Graham Westley, but were pegged back in the final exchanges.
A nine-minute double from John Akinde looked to have won it for the Bees,  before Rigg struck with a minute remaining.
Newport remain bottom and six points adrift in League Two. Barnet are 18th.
Barnet had led 1-0 when the original clash at Rodney Parade was abandoned on 3 September due to heavy rainfall.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "Possession was 50/50, but we had the better of the chances.
"But we are taking steps in the right direction. We are developing a character and desire to win points.
"We could have won it late on. The players are trying very hard to give the fans what they want, which is winning football."
