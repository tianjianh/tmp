A two-storey wildlife observatory at the home of one of only two known pairs of breeding ospreys in Wales has been officially opened.

The round wooden structure has been built at the Cors Dyfi nature reserve near Machynlleth, Powys, with help of nearly £1.4m worth of grants.
The first osprey chick in the Dyfi valley for 400 years hatched in 2011.
The site's breeding pair of Ospreys, Monty and Glesni, returned to their nesting ground from Africa in April.
The pair bred two chicks, Cerist and Clarach, last year.
They have bred again this spring and two eggs are expected to hatch next month.
Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust's Dyfi Osprey Project attracted 31,000 visitors last year.
The trust claims the new vantage point - which has three viewing levels - gives visitors the opportunity to experience the Dyfi ecosystem from a new perspective.
From the upper viewing level, 10m (33ft) above the bog below, the building provides a full 360 degree panoramic view of the Dyfi Valley with the Plynlimon Mountains and Snowdonia National Park beyond.
Project Manager, Emyr Evans said: "It takes forward our vision of enhancing people's relationship with nature and learning about the natural world around us.
"We are lucky to have so much richness and diversity of wildlife in our small part of mid Wales.
"From kites to ospreys, from dormice to otters and marsh violets to bog myrtle.
"The 360 Observatory takes wildlife watching and learning to a higher level, quite literally."
