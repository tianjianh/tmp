Swansea midwife Jean Havard retires after 50 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A south Wales midwife who has helped to bring thousands of babies into the world has retired after 50 years service.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jean Havard, from Pontardawe, first signed up as a pre-nursing student just weeks after turning age 17 in 1965.
But last week she carried out her final night shift as labour ward co-ordinator at Singleton Hospital in Swansea.
Her last shift was extra special, as she delivered 10 babies including a colleague's first grandchild.
Ms Havard spent 20 years at Morriston before moving to Singleton in 1991.
"It is a wonderful profession, I just love it," she said.
"No two shifts are ever the same. But everybody's so happy when a new baby arrives."
