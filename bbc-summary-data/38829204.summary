[SN]TITLE[SN]
Custody death man Thomas Orchard 'tried to get help'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who died after being in police custody "tried to alert officers" to him being in difficulty, a jury heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Thomas Orchard, 32, who had schizophrenia, suffered a cardiac arrest at Heavitree Road Police Station in Exeter in 2012.
Custody sergeant Jan Kingshott, 45, and civilian detention officers Simon Tansley, 39, and Michael Marsden, 56, deny manslaughter by gross negligence.
Bristol Crown Court was shown CCTV of the time Mr Orchard spent in his cell.
The court previously heard how Mr Orchard had suffered a relapse of his mental illness and had been arrested in Sidwell Street on suspicion of a public order offence.
He was found unconscious at Heavitree Road Police Station in Exeter and died seven days later in hospital.
Mr Orchard's legs were in straps for more than four minutes and an emergency response belt placed around his head for five minutes, the court was told.
The court heard such belts were usually used for restraining detainees around the body but it could be used to prevent spitting or biting.
One of the defendants, Mr Kingshott - in interviews mentioned by the prosecution - said it was used because Mr Orchard was a danger and made threats to bite.
Mr Kingshott had said he monitored Mr Orchard, who had worked as a church cleaner, in the cell via a CCTV screen in his office.
The prosecution say Mr Orchard made "sporadic shouts" seven times with the words believed to include "let go".
Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC told the court: "What you don't see is a man fighting. He said nothing, he did nothing".
"We invite the conclusion that he wasn't in a position to do anything as a result of what he'd been subjected to by those detaining him," added Mr Heywood.
The jury was told a pathologist found the use of the belt was not the main or sole factor in Mr Orchard's suffering a cardiac arrest but it was a "contributing factor".
The trial continues.
