[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Agustin Sula, 18, is accused of murdering 21 year old Mateusz Szleper in February.
Hull Crown Court was told Mr Szleper was picking up food with two friends from a takeaway on the city's Spring Bank when the altercation occurred.
Mr Sula is alleged to have followed the victim with his elder brother Ermal Sula and friend Abdullah Ali Haydar.
Prosecutor Timothy Roberts, QC told the jury Mr Szleper was stabbed seven times with a 20cm-long combat knife by Mr Sula while Mr Haydar beat him around the head with a wooden fence post.
Mr Roberts said the men had "acted together to overwhelm Mr Szleper".
"Each one of the three defendants is now charged with the murder of Mr Szleper, because each one of them played his part in that fatal attack," he said.
Mr Roberts said that Agustin Sula hid a bloody knife with his DNA and finger print on in a bush before running from the scene of the attack on West Parade and changing his clothes.
The prosecutor added Mr Szleper's blood was found on Agustin Sula's jeans which had been left in hostel he was staying in.
Agustin Sula, of of no fixed abode; Ermal Sula, 24, of no fixed abode; and Abdullah Ali Haydar, 18, of Alexandra Road, Hull; all deny murder.
The trial continues.
