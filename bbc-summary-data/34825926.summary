The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust is asking people to take part in a consultation on the development of nature tourism in the region.

The trust said areas around the traditional resorts of Skegness and Mablethorpe had "significant untapped potential".
It will look at what can be done to attract more visitors.
Current natural attractions include the grey seal colony at Donna Nook and Gibraltar Point Nature Reserve.
Paul Learoyd, chair of the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust, said: "As well as the castle, cathedral and wonderful heritage - we need to make it clear that it is easy for people to get out there and enjoy the coast - or a walk in the Wolds."
"There is huge potential," he said.
Richard Chadd, from the Greater Lincolnshire Nature Partnership, described the county as a "sleeping giant".
He said he would like to see more made of the county's natural environment.
Meetings are being held at Donna Nook and Gibraltar Point.
