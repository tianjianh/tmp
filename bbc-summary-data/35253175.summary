Marie Logie's body was found in her first-floor flat in Green Gates, Leven, at 20:00 on Tuesday. She had last been seen alive at 08:00 that day.
Mrs Logie had sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service.
Her family paid tribute to the "beloved mother, grandmother and friend".
They said Mrs Logie would be sadly missed, adding that she was "born, bred and lived in the Leven area all her life".
"The family are assisting the police in the investigation and wish to be left alone at this difficult time," they added.
Detectives said there were no signs of a break in and so far no clear motive but they said Mrs Logie was murdered in "a brutal" way.
Mrs Logie was said to be independent, capable and was an active member of the local church.
She had spent the festive period with one of her sons in England, returning home in the new year.
Police said Mrs Logie's neighbour had spoken to her in the morning. She told the neighbour she was going to the shops and then to the hospital to visit a friend.
When the neighbour did not hear from Mrs Logie again he went to investigate and found her dead in her home.
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said: "She had a brutal head injury.
"An 82-year-old woman in the safety of her own home being subjected to such a brutal attack is horrendous."
"Whoever has been responsible for causing Mary's death has preyed on a vulnerable and elderly member of the community and we are pursuing various lines of inquiry as part of this ongoing investigation.
"I would ask that anyone who remembers seeing anything suspicious in the Green Gates area in the days and hours before Mary was found contacts police immediately.
"In addition, anyone with any other information that can help us find Mary's killer should also get in touch."
Mrs Logan's local Church of Scotland minister said the whole community had been "shocked" and "stunned" by the murder.
The Rev Gilbert Nisbet, of Leven Parish Church, said: "Mary was part of the church community and very much involved in the life of the church.
"I have been the minister here for nine years and she came virtually every Sunday and I would chat to her at the door.
"Mary was friendly and outgoing, a kind lady who was bright and interesting to talk to. People are absolutely stunned."
