A sixth man has been charged as part of an investigation into abuse at a school for boys with behavioural problems.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derrick Cooper, 76, of Hillberry Green, Isle of Man, faces six counts of assault and two of child cruelty.
The offences are alleged to have taken place at the former Underley Hall boarding school, near Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria.
Mr Cooper appeared at Kendal Magistrates' Court along with five men who were charged last month.
The five, aged 57 to 72, also face allegations of assault.
All were bailed and will appear at Carlisle Crown Court on 20 March.
Operation Tweed was launched in 2014 by Cumbria Police after a former pupil made allegations.
Underley Hall, an independent boarding school for boys, opened in 1976 and closed in 2012.
