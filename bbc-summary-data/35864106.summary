Fans threw flares and ripped up parts of the Mohammed V stadium after Raja's 2-1 victory over Chabab Rif Al Hoceima.
The country's DGSN security service said in a statement that 31 people were arrested for "acts of vandalism".
FMRFF has banned fans from the next five Raja home matches and fined the club 100,000 dirhams (Â£7,170).
Footage on Moroccan media showed the fans, dressed in the club's green  colours, charging at each other. It was unclear how the clashes had erupted.
