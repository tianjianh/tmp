Sylvia Lancaster, whose 20-year-old daughter Sophie was kicked to death in Bacup in 2007, was appointed an OBE for her campaigns against hate crime.
David Rogers who set up a charity after his 24-year-old son Adam was killed in Blackburn in 2009 was appointed an MBE.
Mr Rogers said he was "blown away" by the honour.
Sophie Lancaster, a goth, was attacked by a gang in a park when she went to help her boyfriend.
Her mother founded the Sophie Lancaster Foundation and has campaigned to have attacks on subcultures treated as hate crimes.
Mrs Lancaster said the award was bittersweet because it came as a result of her daughter's murder.
But she added: "This is taking our work to another level - I'm sure Sophie would have a right good laugh."
Mrs Lancaster spends a lot of time educating police forces about the issues surrounding hate crime.
Mr Rogers, 80, from Blackburn, founded the charity Every Action Has Consequences (EAHC) and has championed restorative justice since his son died of head injuries after the unprovoked attack on a night out.
He works with his wife Pat to warn young people about the dangers of becoming violent while out drinking.
He said his MBE was not just for him but everyone involved in EAHC.
"People have put an awful lot of time, effort and goodwill into it and it is good to see that recognised," he said.
