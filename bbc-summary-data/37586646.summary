[SN]TITLE[SN]
Betsi health board pharmacy trial extended to help GPs

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A trial to ease pressure on GPs by encouraging people to seek advice from pharmacists is being rolled out across north Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In the last year, 19 pharmacists carried out 2,000 consultations with people needing help for minor ailments.
The Common Ailment Scheme (CAS) enables people to receive treatment from a pharmacist for things like head lice.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was the first in Wales to extend the CAS to all its pharmacies.
The roll-out begins on Monday and is due to be completed by March.
Last March, the Welsh government invested Â£750,000 in technology as part of its Choose Pharmacy project to improve integration between NHS providers.
It allows, for example, patients' hospital discharge information to be shared with a nominated pharmacy so a follow-up review can be completed by a pharmacist.
