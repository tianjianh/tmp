[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barack Obama made crowds laugh out loud in Jamaica as he opened up a speech in the country with "wha gawan?"

That means what is going on? - if your Jamaican Patois is not up to much.
In another somewhat awkward attempt at the local dialect, the US president exclaimed, "greetings massive!"
That also scored a roar of perhaps slightly nervous laughter from the audience, as he made the address on Thursday.
Mr Obama is the first US president to visit Jamaica in more than 30 years.
He is there on a three-day trip, which will also take in Panama, to meet representatives of the 15 countries in the Caribbean Community group to discuss energy and security issues.
As well as a speech there was also a tour of the Bob Marley museum.
To the music of the late reggae star's One Love, Mr Obama was shown around Mr Marley's final home in Kingston, where he lived from 1975 to 1981.
The US president said he was a fan of the singer, and told his guide: "I still have all the albums."
His arrival aboard Air Force One on Wednesday made him the first sitting US president to set foot in Jamaica since Ronald Reagan visited 33 years ago.
He was greeted by Prime Minister Portia Simpson-Miller and the US Ambassador to Jamaica, Luis Moreno.
Jamaican Patois was a language developed in the 17th century with West African and English influences.
It is also called Jamaican Creole by linguists.
