MOTD analysis: Paul Pogba gives Man Utd fear factor - Danny Murphy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester United fans will be encouraged by their side's Community Shield win over Leicester, but it is signing Paul Pogba that will really excite them.

Buying the France and Juventus midfielder will mean far more than just adding another quality player to their squad.
Along with the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who scored the winner at Wembley on Sunday, Pogba is another superstar of the type you expect to find in the United team.

That has not always been the case in the past couple of seasons but, with their summer signings and with Jose Mourinho in charge, United will soon have their old fear factor back.
While Pogba has arrived, I do not see Juan Mata being at Old Trafford for too much longer.
Mourinho brought him on in the second half against Leicester and then took him off with only a few seconds to go.
You don't do that unless you are trying to send the player a message and I cannot see how Mata can stay after that.
Everyone has been talking about the size of Pogba's fee all summer, but despite it being a world record Â£89m I think it is becoming irrelevant.
He is overpriced but, with the way the market is, I completely understand why he will cost that much and I know why Mourinho wants him.
For starters he has got more legs than United have got in midfield. I don't know why Morgan Schneiderlin is not being used more but, playing together, Marouane Fellaini and Michael Carrick lack the mobility you need in the Premier League.
Because he is such an athlete, Pogba will give United the ability to really go after teams, with or without the ball, in the way they cannot do at the moment.
He also has the potential to be a goalscoring midfielder too because, although he does nick goals, he does not score enough for a player of his ability.
Used in the right way in this United team, with someone like Carrick alongside him, Pogba's long-range shooting and ability to get into the box will make him a massive threat, and he could be the difference between United winning the title or not. He is that good.
Pogba is definitely a Mourinho player too, and he will adapt to fit his system. You can tell from the role he plays for Juve and what he does for France that he is very adaptable.
Mourinho's biggest job, though, will be to make sure Pogba uses the full repertoire of his ability. It is not as if he is not trying to have more of an end product but he is so talented, there is a lot more to come from him.
How do you think Man Utd should line-up for the 2016/17 season? Pick your XI - and then share it with your friends.
I don't buy Mourinho's excuse that he only took Mata off because he was United's smallest player and Leicester were putting long balls into the box.
They have a lot of history at Chelsea, where Mourinho sold Mata to United in 2014, and now he has embarrassed Mata in front of his supporters.
Taking him off like that is basically saying to him "you are not important". I don't have a problem with a manager being strong with his player but I don't agree with doing it publicly.
Mourinho is such an intelligent man that I am surprised he did it like that. By all means tell a player in your office that he is not in your plans but you should not do it in front of everyone.
He is never going to admit that is what he did to Mata but I was a footballer and I have been there, I know what was happening. I like Mourinho but it was out of order, full-stop.
Mata handled it brilliantly with the way he conducted himself on the pitch afterwards - he celebrated with the rest of the players and did not spit his dummy out.
If it had happened to me, I would not have accepted it. I would have pulled the manager to one side later and given him a piece of my mind. I would have had to, because I would be that upset, and I am sure Mata is upset too.
Pogba and Mata are the two biggest talking points following United's 2-1 win at Wembley but I thought the game itself was decent enough too, with plenty for Leicester fans to be positive about as well.
They have lost N'Golo Kante to Chelsea but they look like they have got a good shape again and, when Nampalys Mendy came on, he looked very much Kante's like-for-like replacement in the way he plays.
They should be fine in that part of their midfield and they have bought some real quality going forward too, with Ahmed Musa and Polish winger Bartosz Kapustka, who was not involved against United.
All of a sudden their players who were playing every week last season are now thinking they have to raise their game. That is important for any team, but especially for Leicester this season.
They have got the Champions League to go for as well as the Premier League, and if they can have a decent run in Europe then their fans will be in dreamland.
What we saw at Wembley was a little sprinkling of what we can expect over the next few months because a serious amount of money has been spent by several sides to create some quality squads.
Hopefully that will create a really competitive top four, five or even six. I am really excited about the new season, so bring it on.
