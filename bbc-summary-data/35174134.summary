[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A joint investigation is under way after a body was found at the building on Vale Road, Rhyl, at about 17:00 GMT on Wednesday.
Eleven neighbouring properties were evacuated and residents were moved to Rhyl leisure centre.
There was nothing to suggest the fire was suspicious, North Wales Police said on Thursday.
The force is working with the fire service to establish the cause of the fire and the identity of the deceased, a police spokeswoman added.
