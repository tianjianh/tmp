[SN]TITLE[SN]
Derby's Riverlights area could become storage site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Derby site earmarked 12 years ago for an Â£83m development of restaurants, flats and shops, could soon be used as a storage site.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Derby City Council bought the Riverlights site in the city centre and approved the project in 2003.
In December, after years of planning disputes and delays due to the recession, new plans for a 50 metre swimming pool were also scrapped.
The authority has now submitted an application to use it as storage space.
If approved, the area between the city's bus station on Moorledge and the River Derwent, could be used for up to five years.
Last month plans to build a new swimming pool at the site were changed after the Labour-led authority said it wanted to use the current Moorways site instead.
A public consultation on the plans runs until 26 January ahead of a decision being made next month.
