Lawro's Premier League predictions v Fighting Talk host Colin Murray

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson will be making a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season against a variety of guests.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponent for this week's fixtures is Colin Murray, host of BBC Radio 5 live's Fighting Talk.
Murray is a Liverpool fan and says his allegiance does not always help when it comes to predictions.
He told BBC Sport: "My Achilles' heel when I take part in prediction leagues is that I never back Liverpool to do worse than draw. It does not matter where they are in reality.
"It is a bad thing because you should be able to take out the emotion when you are predicting results, but I am not able to.
"In one prediction league I do, they show you what the table would look like if all your predictions came true and every season Liverpool win the league by 20 clear points, which is rubbish."
Fighting Talk is broadcast every Saturday morning on BBC Radio 5 live at 11:00 GMT and features a panel of experts trying to win points for their punditry on the week's sports stories.
You can make your Premier League predictions now, compare them with those of Lawro and other fans, and try to take your team to the top of the leaderboard by playing the BBC Sport Predictor game.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Last weekend, Lawro got four correct results, with no perfect scores, from 10 Premier League matches. That gave him a total of 40 points.
He was beaten by Robbie Williams, who got six correct results, with two perfect scores, for a total of 120 points.
All kick-offs 19:45 GMT unless otherwise stated.
Bournemouth 1-0 Leicester
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Colin's prediction: 2-2

Match report
Middlesbrough v Liverpool
Middlesbrough just do not come out and attack teams when they play at home.
It's more than them just being well organised - it is amazing how disciplined they are and how they keep their shape, especially their three midfielders.
The downside of that is that Boro do not pose much of an attacking threat.
Liverpool usually do, but they were off the boil a bit in their draw against West Ham on Sunday.

The Reds were guilty of over-playing at times, and trying to walk the ball into the net. They need to start shooting more from outside the area.
This game will probably be a lot like their defeat at Burnley at the start of the season when they had lots of the ball. Again, the outcome here depends on what they can do with it.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Colin's prediction: 1-2. At the moment it is hard not to see Liverpool scoring two or more a game, and hard not to see is conceding at least one, too, with this new goalkeeper Loris Karius settling in - I don't know where he was standing for that Dimitri Payet free-kick on Sunday.

There are plenty of reasons to be cheerful as a Liverpool fan, though. Elsewhere in our defence I have been a huge fan of Joel Matip from the very beginning, and he looks like a player who could be a key part of our team for the next four or five seasons.
Some of my mates have been getting a bit a bit over - excited after the start we made to the season but it rarely happens that a team's key players stay injury free.
We are missing Philippe Coutinho at the moment and I thought we would have a bit of a blip without him - we are going to get injuries like anyone else, and we don't necessarily have the required depth to our squad.
So, as far as Liverpool's prospects go, I am realistic. If someone offered me fourth place now, I would say yes.
Sunderland v Chelsea
At the moment it feels like Chelsea can deal with whatever you throw at them.
It won't always be that way, but this is top versus bottom, and I don't see Sunderland knocking them over.

Chelsea's performance in their win over West Brom was better in many ways than their performance when they beat Manchester City the previous weekend.
The Blues were physically strong, which you have to be against the Baggies, and just kept probing in attack.
When you have got somebody like Diego Costa up front, in the form he is in at the moment, then you are going to find a way through. He made that goal himself, and it was a great finish too.
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Colin's prediction: 0-1
West Ham v Burnley
West Ham have been on a poor run but picked up a good point at Liverpool on Sunday.

I don't see Slaven Bilic's side surging up the table but their next two games - at home to Burnley and Hull - should give them a chance to move away from the relegation zone.
The Hammers also have players coming back to fitness all the time - Andy Carroll has come off the bench in their past two matches and will be ready for a start soon.
Burnley's home form is still very strong, and they are clearly relying on that to keep them out of trouble.
But they just cannot win away and have taken only one point from six games on the road this season. I don't see them improving that on Wednesday night.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Colin's prediction: 2-0
Crystal Palace v Man Utd (20:00 GMT)
I was at Old Trafford on Sunday to see Manchester United beat Tottenham and Jose Mourinho's side look a much better team with Henrikh Mkhitaryan playing.

United had a good base at the back and their formation at times was like a 4-1-4-1, with Michael Carrick in front of the back four and Anthony Martial, Paul Pogba, Ander Herrera and Mkhitaryan further forward.
Mkhitaryan in particular looked very classy and it is very good news for United that the injury he picked up against Spurs is not serious, and he will be back in action soon.
Palace are still not having any problems scoring goals but they are vulnerable at the back and I think United will have too much for them.
Lawro's prediction: 1-2
Colin's prediction: 1-1
Man City v Watford (20:00 GMT)
Manchester City were all over the place again at the back against Leicester.
Whether it be four or three, then City boss Pep Guardiola needs to stick with a system at the back and stick with the same players to give them a chance to play alongside each other.
At the moment, I don't think they know what is going on. I feel sorry for John Stones because he doesn't know who is playing next to him each week.

As for playing Pablo Zabaleta in midfield, well maybe he is the nearest lookalike in the City squad to Philipp Lahm - that's the only way I can explain it.
I said at the start of the season that City are the worst team that Guardiola has managed, and in the strongest league he has worked in. At the moment he is making a mess of it.
This is a chance for Guardiola to get things right before Arsenal come to Etihad Stadium on Sunday, but Watford will cause City problems too.
The Hornets picked up another good result at the weekend when they beat Everton and I think they will score against City - I just see City scoring more.
Lawro's prediction: 3-1
Colin's prediction: 3-1
Stoke v Southampton (20:00 GMT)
Stoke gave Arsenal a good game at the weekend. They lost in the end, but they are still ticking along quite nicely.
Potters boss Mark Hughes has switched to three at the back which I like because it lets Glen Johnson bomb forward from the back, and gives them a little bit more of an attacking edge.
It is a big blow for Southampton that their top scorer Charlie Austin is out for a few months with a shoulder injury, and I don't see them finding a way past Stoke.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Colin's prediction: 1-1
Tottenham v Hull (20:00 GMT)
Tottenham are clearly a good side but there is a 'but' and the but is there are a lot of games when they are ordinary and they don't have a cutting edge.
This should not be one of them. Hull got something out of their topsy-turvy game against Crystal Palace at the weekend but they let opposing teams have a lot of chances
Lawro's prediction: 3-0
Colin's prediction: 2-0
West Brom v Swansea (20:00 GMT)
Swansea got a really good win against Sunderland on Saturday and if you look at the scorelines of their last three results - 5-4, 0-5 and 3-0 - they are not exactly draw specialists are they?
Do you know what though? I am going to say they will get a point at The Hawthorns.
The main reason is because, at the moment, the Swans do look like they have got goals in them and West Brom's game at Chelsea was tough, and might have taken a lot out of them.
That might just even things out on Wednesday. Swansea will take chances and look to score goals, but that means the opposition get opportunities too.
Lawro's prediction: 1-1
Colin's prediction: 1-1
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week thirteen v Tim Vine)
Lawro's worst score: 30 points (week four v Dave Bautista)
