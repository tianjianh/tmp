England v Australia: Maro Itoje could replace Chris Robshaw

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former captain Chris Robshaw could lose his place in England's back row to Maro Itoje for Saturday's opening Test against Australia in Brisbane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 21-year-old Saracens lock practised in Robshaw's position of blindside flanker in Monday's session as coach Eddie Jones considers his options.
Robshaw missed last month's rout of Wales.
Australian Jones' England face the Wallabies, who were runners-up at the 2015 World Cup, in three Tests.
If Itoje moves, Joe Launchbury would fill the vacancy at lock.
It would pitch Itoje against Australia's world class back row duo David Pocock and Michael Hooper.
