Police said the 54-year-old local woman was attacked at around 23:20 BST on Saturday close to the junction of Tulip Street and Beza Road in the Hunslet area of the city.
The attacker, a white male in his early to mid-20s, later fled the scene on a bicycle.
Detectives said the victim believed she had spoken to her attacker outside The Engine pub earlier in the night.
She suffered a number of injures which required medical treatment and is being supported by specially trained officers.
Det Ch Insp Jim Dunkerley said: "I am very keen to identify the suspect who was riding a bike and had a number of distinctive cuts to his hands.
"He spoke to the victim and said the cuts had been due to a domestic argument with his wife."
Det Ch Insp Dunkerley said additional neighbourhood patrols were taking place in the area to reassure local people.
