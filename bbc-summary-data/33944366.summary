Dale keeper Josh Lillis produced a stunning stop to deny former Wolves striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake, before Tommy Lee twice saved from Donal McDermott.
Ian Evatt headed over for Chesterfield, while debutant Lee Novak also went close for the home side.
McDermott went close with a free-kick but both sides settled for a point.
