Scotland 2-2 Poland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's hopes of reaching Euro 2016 ended as Poland equalised with the final kick of the match at Hampden.

Robert Lewandowski scrambled the ball over the line as the hosts failed to clear a stoppage-time free-kick.
It had appeared Scotland's faint hopes of qualification were still alive as superb goals by Matt Ritchie and Steven Fletcher put them in front.
But Lewandowski, who had silenced the home crowd with an early opener, repeated that feat in the last seconds.
A point would only have been good enough for Scotland had the Republic of Ireland lost at home to Germany.
But Martin O'Neill's side beat the world champions 1-0 in Dublin to consign Gordon Strachan's men to fourth place in Group D.
It means the match against bottom side Gibraltar in Portugal on Sunday is a dead rubber.
Scotland defended stoutly for much of the game but lapses at the outset and the end allowed the deadly Lewandowski to punish them.
With 12 goals in his last four club games and 10 already to his credit in this qualifying campaign, the Bayern Munich striker needed just over two minutes to add to that tally, beating David Marshall at his near post after peeling off the shoulder of Russell Martin.
He kept Martin and Grant Hanley occupied throughout, though the defensive pair largely kept him quiet.
That was until the final act of the match as Kamil Grosicki's deflected free-kick rebounded off the post for Lewandowski to smuggle it into the net.
It was a cruel, if rather typical, end to the game for Scotland, who had done themselves great credit in coming from behind to lead.
Bournemouth winger Ritchie's ferocious drive just before half-time gave them an impetus largely lacking in the first half.
And Fletcher's beautifully taken curling finish looked like being enough to win - until Lewandowski's late intervention.
After Sunday's meaningless game in Gibraltar, Strachan will have to decide whether he sees a future for himself as the national manager.
The Scottish Football Association has already stated its desire to keep him in the post.
Although there have been some poor performances and results in recent months, the consensus is that Scotland are improving under the 58-year-old.
When asked about his future after the game, he said: "The players are the priority at the moment. To talk about me is all wrong. I will leave that to other people.
"I have people in this building hurting and I need to look after them."
