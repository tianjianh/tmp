Swansea City's 4-1 win at West Ham has enhanced Francesco Guidolin's chances of staying on as head coach says first-team coach Alan Curtis.

Guidolin has led Swansea to Premier League safety since joining in January.
But the Italian's future beyond next Sunday's final game of the season against Manchester City is unclear.
"There's nothing much else he could do," former Wales striker Curtis said. "He came in with a brief to keep us up and he's done that."
Garry Monk was sacked as head coach in December and, after Curtis' temporary spell in charge, Guidolin, 60, was appointed until the end of the season.
The former Udinese coach has previously stated he and chairman Huw Jenkins have already started planning for next season but does not know if he will be offered a new deal.
Former Swansea boss Brendan Rodgers, ex-Chile national team manager Marcello Bielsa and former Derby County manager Paul Clement have all been linked with the job.
Curtis says Swansea's victory, in Upton Park's final Saturday game, gives the team something to build on ahead of next season whoever will be in charge.
Goals from Wayne Routledge, Andre Ayew, Ki Sung-Yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis inflicted West Ham's first home Premier League defeat since August.
"It's a real fantastic result for us. We found a real cutting edge," Curtis said.
"We knew what to expect from West Ham. We had to be big and strong but then also to play our football.
"Over the years everybody's been accustomed to seeing a Swansea team playing that way.
"We've been at the wrong end of the table for far too long but we've showed the ability that we've got."
