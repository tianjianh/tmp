Dismaland opened in Weston-super-Mare a week ago but tickets only went on sale on Tuesday after website problems.
Dozens have now appeared on eBay and StubHub with some being sold for many times the face value of £3.
A spokesman for the artist warned fans not to buy the touted tickets and to only buy from the official site.
On Wednesday, tickets for the show were on sale for between £30 and £1,000 on eBay and an average of about £40 on StubHub.
For the past week, visitors have had to queue outside the Tropicana, where the exhibition is based, while issues with online ticketing were resolved.
The official Dismaland site went down several times as tickets for the first week went on sale on Tuesday. Those tickets quickly sold out.
The show is due to run for another five weeks with further batches of tickets being sold on the official website.
The Dismaland exhibition is a dark take on theme parks with a nod to Disneyland, featuring work by more than 50 artists including Bristolian Banksy.
Among the exhibits are a distorted mermaid, a dilapidated fairy castle and a boat pond where all the boats are filled with models of migrants, as well as paintings and a beach ball hovering above upturned knives.
