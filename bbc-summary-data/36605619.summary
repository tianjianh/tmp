Birds of prey target swimmers' underwear to line nests

Birds of prey on an Angus Glens estate have been stealing swimmers' underwear to line their nest.

The red kites at Gannochy made off with pants and socks from a nearby wild swimming spot.
RSPB officials made the discovery when they went to ring and record the kites' four new chicks.
The estate's gamekeeper Dave Clement said it was the second year in a row that the birds had taken garments from swimmers.
Mr Clement, a member of the Angus Glens Moorland Group, said it appeared that the kites had become more discerning in their choice of undergarments.
He said: "The licences ringer who went up the tree to the nest said there were Armani pants and another brand, as well as socks, which they must have pinched off the swimmers at the local gorge.
"It seems they will take anything to line the nest, then lay the eggs on top, and someone must have gone home minus some underwear.
"It is clearly working because the nest is very successful.
"Last year there were two chicks, now it's four, and there is clearly plenty of food for them on the estate."
