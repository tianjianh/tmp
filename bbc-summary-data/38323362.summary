The 14-year-old, who formed one half of the sport's most successful partnerships with Dujardin, 31, performed a special routine at Olympia.
"He's just the best," said Dujardin after reprising her London 2012 test.
Dujardin is weighing up several possible successors, including Mount St John Freestyle, for Tokyo 2020.
Although he is retiring from competition, Valegro will continue to give celebrity appearances and demonstrations.
"I want to retire him at the top of his game because he owes me absolutely nothing," said Dujardin.
"Now we can take the pressure off and go around and really enjoy ourselves. He deserves that."
Meanwhile Carl Hester, who is Dujardin's Great Britain team-mate, mentor, trainer and co-owner of Valegro, added freestyle victory to Tuesday's dressage success aboard Nip Tuck with a score of 84.669%.
