A review into what is taught in schools in Wales will be implemented in full, Education Minister Huw Lewis has confirmed.

Earlier this year a review by Prof Graham Donaldson suggested wide-ranging changes.
They include more lessons on computer programming and more cooperation between primary and secondary schools.
Mr Lewis told BBC Wales the reforms would take up to eight years to introduce.
It would be the biggest shake-up to education since 1944, he added.
Speaking on The Wales Report with Huw Edwards, Mr Lewis said: "He has shown us a framework that fits with the way welsh parents, Welsh communities would want to shape the Welsh education system, which is very distinctive, very different from what we are seeing happening over the border in England.
"But I think it is what we would like to see, and what we need.
"We are not playing games here. This is fundamental reform. Graham Donaldson has said seven to eight years.  I think that is a realistic timeframe for us."
