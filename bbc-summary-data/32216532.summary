[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man has appeared in court accused of abducting a six-year-old boy and hitting a woman with a cricket bat in a Dundee toy shop - while naked.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Przemyslaw Kaluzny is facing a total of 12 charges over a series of alleged incidents at Toys R Us on Sunday.
The 41-year-old is accused of picking up the boy and trying to run out of the shop with him before attacking his 67-year-old grandmother with the bat.
He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody.
Kaluzny, of Watson Street, Dundee, is first alleged to have stolen a mobile phone from a neighbour's flat before intentionally exposing his genitals to her. He is then said to have stolen a cricket bat from the flat before taking and driving away a Renault Laguna car.
He is then alleged to have driven the car from the Baxter Park area of the city to the Kingsway Retail Park without insurance and without a licence.
Prosecutors say Kaluzny then went into the Toys R Us store and committed a breach of the peace by behaving in a disorderly manner and running into the store while in possession of a cricket bat.
He is then said to have removed his clothing, shouted, bawled, entered the toilets and adopted a menacing and aggressive attitude, brandished the bat, and placed staff and customers in a state of alarm by struggling violently with them.
Kaluzny is further accused of an offence of public indecency by moving through the store while naked.
He is then alleged to have abducted a six-year-old boy by picking him up and attempting to run out of the shop while carrying him and detaining him against his will.
Kaluzny is further alleged to have assaulted the boy's 67-year-old grandmother by striking her on the head with the bat to her injury.
A final charge alleges that he broke a pair of police handcuffs while he was being transported from the store to Dundee's police HQ.
He made no plea or declaration during a brief private hearing at Dundee Sheriff Court, and was remanded in custody by Sheriff George Way until a further hearing next week.
