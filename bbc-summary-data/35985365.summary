[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 61-year-old man was arrested in England and detained in Kent on Wednesday.
He is now being interviewed at Musgrave police station in Belfast. Two men, aged 27 and 28, detained by police in Derry remain in custody.
Mr McCauley died in June 2015 in a care facility, almost nine years after he was attacked at a barbeque.
He was attending a summer BBQ at the rear of a house in Chapel Road on 15 July that year.
At 3.20am on 16 July, only three people remained at the BBQ.
A number of people came out from the bushes and attacked Paul and two of his friends. After the assault the group made off in the direction of Irish Street.
