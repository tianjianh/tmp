Britain's Kell Brook wants to defend his IBF world welterweight title before the end of May in the first of two fights he is planning this summer.

The unbeaten 28-year-old retained his title by stopping Jo Jo Dan in Sheffield last Saturday.
Promoter Eddie Hearn had called for fellow Briton Amir Khan to meet Brook at Wembley on 13 June, but has a show at London's O2 on 30 May.
"Saturday night was fantastic, I want to capitalise on that win," Brook said.
"I have told Eddie Hearn to get me out as soon as possible and I want to fight twice before the end of the summer, starting at the end of May."
Khan, 28, has accepted Brook's challenge to meet at Wembley "within the next 12 months", but is expected to fight before the end of May and could meet former WBC lightweight champion Adrien Broner.
Bolton fighter Khan seemed to end speculation of an immediate clash with Brook by tweeting, "Already given my word to a fighter, will be announcing my next fight very soon."
The winner of the contest on 2 May between Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao - considered to be the best two fighters of their generation - could be a target for Khan, who suggested he would be interested in meeting Brook if the Yorkshireman beats fighters of the calibre of Khan's last opponent Devon Alexander.
"Originally we were planning Kell's next fight for July but he is itching to fight again and we could bring him back as early as May," Hearn said.
"There is no stopping Kell now and we want to get him back in action as soon as possible."
