Dundee United 3-0 Ayr United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dundee United claimed their first Championship win at the third attempt as they brushed aside Ayr at Tannadice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Simon Murray, Jamie Robson and Willo Flood all scored as the hosts brought their League Cup form into the league.
After Cammy Smith was fouled, Nick van der Velden's penalty was saved by Greg Fleming but Murray was the quickest to react and headed in from close range.
Robson turned in Flood's low delivery before Flood sealed the points when he converted Tope Obadeyi's cross.
It was the midfielder's first goal since returning to the club for a fourth time last month, and helped lift United to fourth place, five points behind leaders Raith Rovers and Hibernian.
The Tangerines began the game in whirlwind fashion with Van der Velden, Scott Fraser, Murray and Coll Donaldson all going close in the opening 10 minutes.
The visitors' defence was under severe pressure and was eventually breached after 13 minutes.
Smith was pulled down inside the box by Paddy Boyle and, although Dutch midfielder Van der Velden's spot-kick was saved, Murray reacted swiftly to nod the ball in.
Ayr's former Dundee midfielder Gary Harkins warmed the palms of Cammy Bell with a thunderous 25-yard shot but United scored their second eight minutes before the break.
Van der Velden cut the ball back from the bye-line and, although the Ayr defence cleared the initial cross, Robson pounced to blast the ball beyond Fleming.
It was the 18-year-old's first ever goal for the club as he continues to repay the faith shown in him by manager Ray McKinnon.
Ayr introduced Jamie Thoms and Brian Gilmour for the second half and the visitors did improve but failed to test Bell in the home goal.
The home side, urged on by a crowd of 6,427, looked a little uneasy in the second period until McKinnon brought on Obedeyi and Blair Spittal with 15 minutes left, producing an immediate impact.
Obedeyi did well to Flood inside the six-yard box and the midfielder found the back of the net with ease as United strolled to victory.
Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon:
"If you had said to me before the game we would have a 3-0 win I would have been happy with that.
"We had a really good first half so I'm very pleased with that. The second half we have to give credit to Ayr United who came back into the game and made it difficult for us.
"There is no divine right to win games in this league. Everybody has quality in their teams and you have to be at it for 90 minutes."
Ayr United boss Ian McCall:
"I don't think it was a fair reflection on the game. We had a couple of really good opportunities in the first half but I would not begrudge Dundee United their 2-0 lead.
"I thought we were the dominant team for most of the second half and had numerous opportunities to work the keeper but didn't.
"Some of the players are still finding their feet. They were a lot better today but they just need to find their belief at these places and just play."
