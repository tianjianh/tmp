[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The body that awards the Nobel Prize for Literature has said it has stopped trying to contact US singer Bob Dylan about being this year's honouree.

"Right now we are doing nothing," said Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy.
"I have called and sent emails to his closest collaborator and received very friendly replies. For now, that is certainly enough."
Dylan has yet to comment about winning the prestigious prize last week.
The 75-year-old performed in Las Vegas shortly after his win was announced but made no mention of the award.
It is not known whether the singer-songwriter will travel to Stockholm to receive his award in person on 10 December.
"If he doesn't want to come, he won't come," Danius told reporters. "It will be a big party in any case and the honour belongs to him."
Dylan is the first person to receive the award for songwriting and the first American to win since 1993.
The balladeer, artist and occasional actor was recognised "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition".
A message recognising the honour was posted on Dylan's official Facebook page.
