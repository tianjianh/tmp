Police said the victim escaped out of an upstairs bedroom after three raiders broke into the house on Swayfield Avenue, Longsight, Manchester.
The offenders, one of whom had a gun, bound the victim's mouth with tape and demanded cash in the raid at about 20:30 GMT on Sunday.
Police described it as "terrifying".
Supt Dave Pester of Greater Manchester Police said it was a "terrifying experience for the victim" and specialist officers were supporting her.
He said a "dedicated team of detectives" were committed to the investigation to find out what happened and appealed for anyone with information to contact the force.
