The assaults happened in Castlemilk, Glasgow, at about 20:05 on Friday.
Police said the boy was walking in Ardencraig Quadrant near its junction with Ardencraig Drive when he was seriously assaulted.
His 52-year-old father, who saw the incident, was attacked when he ran over to help. The pair were both treated in hospital for facial injuries.
They were later released.
The two suspects were described as being white, aged between 17 and 21, and wearing dark clothes.
Det Con Peter McFarlane said: "These were violent and unprovoked attacks and officers are currently carrying out house-to-house inquiries and reviewing CCTV images in their ongoing efforts to identify the two responsible.
"Although we believe this to be a random incident, there will be additional patrols in the area to provide public reassurance."
In a separate incident, at about 20:00 on Saturday, a 23-year-old man was assaulted in Partick in what police believe was a targeted attack.
The man was walking along Exeter Drive, near its junction with Dumbarton Road, when a man got out of a passing car and seriously assaulted him. The suspect then got back into his car and drove off.
Passers-by went to help and he was taken to hospital to be treated for head and facial injuries. He was later released.
Police said there was no description of the suspect available, but he was driving a grey BMW 3 Series saloon.
Det Con David Hardie said: "We believe this to be a targeted attack and officers are carrying out inquiries in the area today and checking CCTV footage in an effort to gather more information on the circumstances surrounding this attack and the man responsible."
Detectives have appealed for anyone with information about either attack to contact them.
