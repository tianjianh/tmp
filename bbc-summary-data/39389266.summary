[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fleetwood Town 0-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicky Ajose further boosted Swindon's hopes of League One survival with his late winner against Fleetwood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ajose's 81st-minute effort sealed Town's second dramatic 1-0 victory, having beaten Millwall last time out with a goal from Conor Thomas deep into stoppage time.
Despite that confidence booster, it was Fleetwood who made most of the early running in this match, with their best opportunity coming when David Ball picked out Kyle Dempsey, only for Ash Hunter to be unable to get a toe on the through-ball as Lawrence Vigouroux gathered
Swindon might have grabbed the lead on the half hour, against the run of play as Thomas let fly with a snap-shot from the edge of the box which forced a superb diving save from Alex Cairns.
Fleetwood continued to be frustrated after half-time, and Uwe Rosler threw on two substitutes in a bid to shake up an average display.
But it was Swindon who found another gear, Thomas poking just wide having been left unmarket at the near post.
And with nine minutes remaining Ajose scored what could prove a vital Robins goal.
Running onto a long through-ball from Charlie Colkett he got the wrong side of Ashley Eastham before slotting low under Cairns to claim the victory.
