Gareth Southgate: Interim England manager wants future decided within a month

Gareth Southgate wants to know within a month whether the Football Association will appoint him as England manager.

The 46-year-old's last game as interim manager will be Tuesday's friendly against Spain at Wembley (19:45 GMT).
An FA committee will then make a decision on who will be given the permanent job - with England Under-21 boss Southgate the heavy favourite.
"It will be important for me to know what I'm doing after the middle of November," he said.
"We've got a European Under-21 Championship to prepare for and the seniors have got their next round of qualifiers [in March].
"Of course everybody is going to want to know, I guess, by the end of November, middle of December, where everything is heading so we can decide who is responsible for which parts of the organisation's work."
Southgate, a former England defender, was effectively handed a four-game trial period by the FA after the abrupt end to Sam Allardyce's 67-day spell in charge in September.
He has led the national team to seven points from a possible nine in World Cup qualifying, and they lead Group F by two points following Friday's 3-0 win over Scotland.
Asked about whether he wanted the England job in his news conference before the Spain friendly, Southgate said: "I don't think now is the time for those discussions.
"Everything is about the team. I am not a coach for whom what happens to me is the most important thing.
He added: "We've got some players really open to improving, are desperately keen to play, want to do well for their country. We have some terrific athletes which means the style of play can be very much on the front foot.
"The challenge is continuity. My view of managing has always been you manage every game like you are going to be there forever.
"For any club or organisation you have to think about long term, not just short."
FA chairman Greg Clarke, technical director Dan Ashworth, chief executive Martin Glenn and League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson will decide who will be England's next manager.
Southgate's only job at club level was at Middlesbrough from 2006 and 2009, but he is not worried about a lack of experience.
"Maybe you prove yourself at a smaller one first or maybe you don't," he said. "Pep [Guardiola] was straight in at Barcelona having worked with the B team.
"Everybody's path is different. I don't think there is an ideal pathway."
