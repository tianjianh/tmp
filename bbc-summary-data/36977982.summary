[SN]TITLE[SN]
Three jailed for Liverpool to Jersey heroin import

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and two women have been jailed over heroin offences including trafficking from Liverpool to Jersey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
About 28g of the drug was smuggled twice between September and October in 2015.
Sean Lambotte, 40, from St Clement, Jersey and Joanne Olaosebikan, 38, from Liverpool, and Amy Le Masurier, 32, from St Helier, Jersey had all pleaded guilty to various offences.
Commissioner Sir Michael Birt said Lambotte played the "greatest" role.
Handing Lambotte a six-year sentence for one count of conspiracy to import heroin, Sir Michael said he accepted Lambotte was himself a heroin addict.
"We hope very much you are on the way to conquering it," he told Lambotte at Jersey Royal Court.
The court heard Lambotte had arranged to sell the drugs in Jersey on behalf of contacts in the UK, with Olaosebikan acting as the "mule" who imported the drugs to Jersey and delivered money back.
Le Masurier allowed her flat to be used for the drugs handover.
Olaosebikan was given four-and-a-half years and a two week term to run concurrently for conspiracy to import heroin and possession of cannabis.
Le Masurier received a two-year sentence for being concerned in the supply of heroin and a 12-month sentence for possession of heroin, to run concurrently.
