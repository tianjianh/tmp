[SN]TITLE[SN]
The Qualifiers: Salford Red Devils 16-19 London Broncos

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
London Broncos survived a late Salford fightback to secure a 19-16 victory which kept alive their hopes of winning promotion back to Super League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tries from William Barthau, Scott Leatherbarrow and Jamie Soward, plus Barthau's drop-goal, helped the Broncos into a 19-6 lead with 10 minutes left.
However, Josh Griffin crossed twice late on to set up a nervy finish.
The win draws London level on points with fifth-placed Salford with one game of The Qualifiers remaining.
Salford travel to Batley and London face Featherstone next Sunday, with whoever finishes fifth qualifying for the Million Pound Game and a play-off for the final place in next season's Super League.
