Dunfermline sign former Kilmarnock defender Lee Ashcroft

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dunfermline have signed defender Lee Ashcroft following the defender's exit from Kilmarnock.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ashcroft played 20 games for Killie last season, including the 4-0 second-leg playoff final victory over Falkirk that kept the club in the top flight.
However, manager Lee Clark elected not to offer Ashcroft, 22, a new deal after his contract at Rugby Park expired.
The Pars have already bolstered their squad with the signing of Inverness midfielder Nat Wedderburn.
