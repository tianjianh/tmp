Police said the man was being held over alleged offensive behaviour. He is understood to be among those pictured in a recent police CCTV images appeal.
Several appeals for information were made after toilets were vandalised at the game and offensive effigies of Rangers fans were hung from the stands.
The match, which Celtic won 5-1, took place at Celtic Park on 10 September.
