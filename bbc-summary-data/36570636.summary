Operation Neptune follows reports of dolphins being targeted off the coasts of Abersoch and Tywyn, Gwynedd.
MP Liz Saville-Roberts and North Wales Police's wildlife unit are among those who have joined to launch the campaign.
It aims to make it easier for people to report those they suspect of harassing marine wildlife.
Ms Saville-Roberts, Plaid Cymru MP for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, was joined by Abersoch councillor Robert Wyn Williams, Sgt Rob Taylor from North Wales Police's rural crime team and a local jet-ski owner in Abersoch to kick-start the campaign ahead of the summer season.
"The majority of boat and jet-ski users are responsible and adhere to the marine code of conduct, but those who wilfully frighten and intimidate marine wildlife should be held accountable for their actions," Ms Saville-Roberts said.
She said the campaign aimed to both "promote the responsible and safe use of marine craft" and inform the public of the best way to report "irresponsible behaviour on our coastline".
Sgt Rob Taylor added: "Coastal seas around north Wales support important habitats and wildlife and we urge all jet-skiers and boat owners to act responsibly at all times and respect this."
