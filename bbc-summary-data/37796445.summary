The eight-year-old boy and six-year-old girl were found at the property in Holland Road, Hamstead, Birmingham.
Their father was found inside a fire-damaged car in Staffordshire later on Friday morning, West Midlands Police said.
He suffered life-threatening injuries and is in a critical condition in hospital.
Post-mortem examinations on the brother and sister are due to take place later.
West Midlands Police said officers were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

Despite attempts by fire crews to resuscitate the children, "nothing could be done" to save either of them, the ambulance service said.
Their 36-year-old mother was also assessed by the ambulance service but did not suffer any serious injuries.
Residents told the BBC a neighbour had carried the children out of the house and laid them on the lawn.
Firefighters were called to the scene at about 03:40 BST and extinguished a fire in the hallway.
Less than two hours earlier paramedics had attended a shooting in nearby Handsworth Wood.
Police have launched an attempted murder investigation but said the incident was not related to the fire.
Det Insp Justin Spanner said: "The events of this morning remain unclear and we are still trying to piece together the circumstances leading up to what happened.
"This is a terrible incident and my thoughts are with everyone who has been affected."
Dawn Hill, who lives in the road, said she was in bed when she heard a scream.
"It was terrible - I can still hear it now," she said.
She said she went outside and saw a woman who was "uncontrollable". Two children were on the grass and a firefighter was trying to resuscitate them, she said.
Det Ch Insp Martin Slevin said the man they believe to be the children's father, who is aged in his 40s, was found inside a black Vauxhall Insignia in Whitmore Road in the Butterton area of Newcastle-under-Lyme at about 07:15.
The car had significant fire damage. He remains in hospital in a critical condition.
Anyone who saw the vehicle in the area on Friday morning should contact police, he added.
A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said the two children were in cardiac arrest when they arrived.
"Bystanders had already started CPR which crews took over before also administering advanced life support,"  he said.
The youngsters were treated on the way to hospital, he said, but shortly after arrival "it became clear that nothing could be done to save either child and they were confirmed deceased".
West Midlands Fire Service said its investigators were working with police to establish how the fire started.
Neighbours said the two children often played and rode their bikes outside their home after returning from school.
Zainab Harun, who lives on Holland Road, said: "I used to talk to them whenever they walked past. It's a sad, terrible thing that has happened here."
A woman who wished to remain anonymous, who said she was a care worker colleague of the children's mother, described what had happened as "wicked".
"We're just trying to deal with it," she said.
"She was supposed to come to work this morning so we tried calling her but there was no answer."
