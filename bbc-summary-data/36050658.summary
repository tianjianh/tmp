The Democratic race has turned increasingly negative in recent days as the candidates traded barbs about their qualifications for the presidency.
The Democrats have largely avoided the personal attacks that have dominated the Republicans' debates.
But with so much at stake that changed at Thursday's debate.
"Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be President? Of course she does?" Mr Sanders said at the debate. "But I do question her judgement."
Mr Sanders repeatedly criticised Mrs Clinton for her financial ties to Wall Street, particularly her paid speeches to an investment bank. He also faulted her for supporting the Iraq War.
Meanwhile, Mrs Clinton has questioned whether Mr Sanders has adequately thought out his policy proposals after he struggled to provide specifics during an interview with the New York Daily News.
"It's easy to diagnose the problem. It's another thing to do something about it," Mrs Clinton said.
The candidates' recent tensions were on display on stage. Mr Sanders mocked Mrs Clinton's responses at times while Mrs Clinton occasionally talked over her opponent.
Other highlights included:
A resurgent Mr Sanders has won seven of the last eight contests, sparking a groundswell of enthusiasm from his supporters.
The Sanders campaign drew more than 25,000 people to a rally on Wednesday in Washington Square in Manhattan.
However, buoyed by earlier wins across the southern US, Mrs Clinton holds sizeable lead in the number delegates needed to secure the nomination.
Many analysts believe that Mr Sanders needs to pull off an upset in New York to remain viable in the race.
Mrs Clinton, who represented the state in US Senate for two terms, holds a commanding lead in New York, according to recent polls.
