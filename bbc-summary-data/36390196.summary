The 34-year-old, who is leaving Paris St-Germain after his contract expired, said he has had "many" offers from around the world.
"The future is written," he said. "I made my choice a long time ago. I just have to push the button."
Asked about a move to United, he responded: "Let's see what happens."
Jose Mourinho, who is set to be named United manager following Louis van Gaal's sacking, worked with Ibrahimovic for one season at Inter Milan.
United, winners of a record 20 top-flight titles in England, finished fifth in the league this season and failed to qualify for the Champions League.
"He is the man to bring them back to the top," said Ibrahimovic, who won the Serie A title with Inter under Mourinho in 2008-09 before joining Barcelona.
"I had a fantastic time working with him. If we will work again I don't know."

Ibrahimovic, currently on international duty with Sweden before Euro 2016, said he has "many options", including a return to Italy.
"There is concrete offers from the Premier League. But I don't give guarantees," he added.
Ibrahimovic made his debut for hometown club Malmo in 1999 and went on to play for Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG.
He has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG. His 38 league goals were also a club record.
"I have proved age is a number," he said. "Everything is in your head. If I want to make it I will do it."
