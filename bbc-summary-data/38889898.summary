[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion 1-1 Ipswich Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton missed the chance to go top of the Championship as they were held to a draw at home by Ipswich.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors were down to 10 men while Emyr Huws received treatment, but Luke Chambers beat keeper David Stockdale to a free-kick to head them in front.
Huws then pulled Bruno down for a penalty, allowing Tomer Hemed to slot in his sixth goal in five league games.
Chambers struck the post for Ipswich after the break, while Glenn Murray hit the woodwork for the home side.
Chris Hughton's side were going for an eighth straight win in front of their own fans, but remain a point behind Newcastle and only four points ahead of the chasing pack.
The Tractor Boys had five players booked in the first half, including top scorer Tom Lawrence, who must now serve a two-game ban.
Brighton had an appeal for a second spot-kick waved away by Roger East, when Solly March went down under Jordan Spence's challenge.
Despite having the league's best home record, the Seagulls have now beaten Ipswich only twice in their last 10 meetings on home soil.
Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton:
"Ipswich are a a good side but by the time we got the equaliser we deserved it. Our levels were not as good as they have been. It became probably too open a game in the second half."
"It certainly feels like two points dropped. On other days we would have got the win. We are in a very good position in the league and deserve to be there.
"It is incredibly difficult to go through the season without difficult periods. Occasionally you get a team blowing everyone away. Newcastle are the biggest spenders but they have not got away from everyone else by massive margins."
Ipswich Town boss Mick McCarthy:
"I'm immensely proud of them. It wasn't a backs-to-the wall display - their keeper kept them in the game.
"Brighton passed and moved it and we had to defend. We are quite clearly on an upward curve and let's hope it continues."
