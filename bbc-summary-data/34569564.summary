Children using city trams become 'separated from parents'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children became separated from their parents eight times during the first month of operation for new tram routes in Nottingham.

It follows a three-year-old girl becoming stranded at a stop, in September, after the tram's doors shut, parting her from her parents.
Nottingham Express Transit (NET) apologised, but the BBC has discovered there have been more incidents.
NET has asked drivers to allow more time at stops and to be more attentive.
Mike Mabey, NET's head of operations, said in some cases parents were still buying tickets at machines at tram stops when children boarded the tram without them.
He said: "Children get quite excited when they see the tram and it's quite often [the case] parents are buying the tickets... the child jumps on and the tram goes away.
"[We've] instructed all drivers to allow extra time at tram stops and be a bit more vigilant.
"It's not always possible for the drivers to identify who is associated with who... I'm pleased to say those numbers are dropping as people are getting used to it."
Line two of Nottingham's tram extension opened in late-August.
A few weeks later three-year-old Maisie Phillips was taking her first trip on the new tram line to Clifton with her parents when she became separated from them.
Her father Anthony Phillips said he tried opening the doors, but the driver refused to stop "for safety reasons".
Mr Phillips said he got off at the next stop and ran half-a-mile back to Maisie, who was being looked after by another passenger.
