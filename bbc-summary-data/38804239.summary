Hull City's Ryan Mason has been discharged from hospital a week after fracturing his skull against Chelsea.

Midfielder Mason, 25, clashed heads with Blues defender Gary Cahill 13 minutes into the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge on 22 January.
He was taken to St Mary's Hospital in London, where he had surgery.
"The number of messages offering support during Ryan's recovery has been quite overwhelming," said Hull club doctor Mark Waller.
Well-wishes flooded in for the England international, and both Hull and his former club Tottenham wore training shirts with Mason printed on the back before last week's fixtures.
Mason, who joined Hull from Spurs last August for a club-record undisclosed fee, has scored one goal in 16 Premier League appearances for the Tigers.
