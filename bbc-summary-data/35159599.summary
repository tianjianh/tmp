Wolves have agreed to sign Poland international winger Michal Zyro from Legia Warsaw, subject to the player passing a medical.

Left-footed Zyro, 23, is comfortable playing anywhere across the forward line and has won four caps for Poland.
"We have a deal agreed and it'll be kicking in at the start of January," head coach Kenny Jackett told BBC WM.
"He can play in any of the attacking positions and, being left-footed, he brings a balance."
Jackett is keen to strengthen his squad at Molineux after seeing his side's Championship play-off challenge falter in recent weeks with just one win in eight matches.
But he is confident the club's board will continue to support his desire to bring in some fresh faces.
"There's no doubt we are on the same page and want the same thing - which is success," Jackett said.
"To try and bring in some players in January is something we're all focussed on."
Wolves are nine points off the top six in the Championship and take on Reading at Molineux on Boxing Day.
