Captain Danny Batth says Wolves players will use the remaining games this season to give the fans something to be proud of.

With the club unlikely to close the 12-point gap to the play-off places over the final nine matches, Batth insists the campaign is not going to peter out.
"Definitely not - that's not how we see it in the dressing room," Batth, 25, told BBC WM 95.6.
"It's very much business as usual, we're all working very hard."
A slow start to the campaign, winning just six of their opening 22 Championship matches, affected Wolves' early prospects of challenging for promotion.
The club have also been hit by a spate of injuries to key players, including Wales international Dave Edwards, and the sale of star striker Benilk Afobe to Bournemouth in January.
Four successive wins in December and January closed the gap to the top six to six points, but two victories in the past 11 games leaves Wolves 12th in the table after 37 matches.
But Batth insists they will put the last few fixtures to good use.
"We need to improve our system and keep progressing," he added.
"We have to win games at home - we've not done that enough this season, we've got to give the fans something to be happy about watching."
