Lukas Adamczyk gave PSNI the lead against their top-flight opponents with a 20th-minute penalty but Scott McCrory's own goal saw the sides go in level at half-time.
Paul McDowell, Johnny Courtney and Stuart Hutchinson were on target after the break to ensure their side's passage.
Tony Kane's first-half penalty sent holders Ballymena United on their way to a 3-0 success against H&W Welders at the Showgrounds, with in-form strike pair Johnny McMurray and Cathair Friel both finding the net in the second half to give the final scoreline a more convincing look.
Linfield met with stubborn resistance from the visiting Donegal Celtic defence in the first half of their tie at Windsor Park but second-half strikes from Reece Glendinning, Mark Haughey, Stephen Lowry and Paul Smyth saw the Blues safely through 4-0.
Cliftonville were the night's highest scorers as they outclassed Premier Intermediate League outfit Bangor 7-1 at Solitude.
The Reds went in three up at the interval thanks to goals from Jay Donnelly and Gary Donnelly (2) and soon after the break Gary Donnelly scored from the spot to complete his hat-trick.
David McDaid and Ross Lavery got their names on the scoresheet, while Bangor scored an own goal and gained scant consolation with a Gerard McMullan penalty in the final minute.
Andy Mitchell fired home and added a penalty in the first half to give Crusaders a 2-0 victory over Larne at Inver Park, while Albert Foundry were 1-0 winners over Newington in the only game not involving a Premiership team.
Ards eased through to the draw for the next round by seeing off Knockbreda 3-1, Tommy Wray's own goal put Ards ahead with Carl McComb scoring the other two. David Johnson was Knockbreda's goalscorer.
