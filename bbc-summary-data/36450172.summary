Koeman's agent confirmed to BBC Sport that talks are under way, but the Dutchman has not yet spoken to Everton.
The Merseyside club, who finished 11th in the Premier League table, fired Spaniard Martinez, 42, in May.
Former Ajax boss Frank de Boer has also been linked to the vacant managerial position at Goodison Park.
Everton have remained silent on their search for a successor to Martinez, but it is believed Koeman has always been the first choice of new major shareholder Farhad Moshiri, the billionaire who acquired a 49.9% share in the club in February.
The list of candidates also included former Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini and Sevilla's Unai Emery, in addition to De Boer, who recently left Ajax. David Moyes, who left Everton after an 11-year tenure as manager to succeed Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in 2013, was also spoken to.
Moshiri also wants to appoint a director of football as he moves towards a more continental management model, but attempting to secure Koeman has always been his top priority.
Koeman was appointed Saints manager in 2014 and led the club to seventh in the Premier League in his first season in charge. This year they finished in sixth place, again qualifying for the Europa League.
Speaking about speculation on his position before the final game of the season, he said: "I am manager of Southampton. Everyone knows I have one year more on my contract.
