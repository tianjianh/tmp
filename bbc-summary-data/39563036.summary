£5m Flintshire crematorium project set for July start

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £5m project to build a crematorium in Flintshire will get under way in July, developers have said.

It follows three years of wrangling over the plans and a legal battle with a rival scheme.
The proposals for the facility in Northop were initially rejected by councillors, but approved following a planning inquiry.
It will now be sited on land between Kelsterton and Oakenholt Lanes in the village.
"We are currently finalising our remaining pre-commencement conditions with the hope of starting on site in July," said Jamieson Hodgson, from the Oxfordshire-based firm, Memoria.
"This means that we will aim to be open by mid-2018 so we can finally provide this much-needed public service facility to the people of Flintshire."
