A dairy cattle exhibitor has been disqualified from the Great Yorkshire Show after an animal was tampered with, organisers have said.

The Yorkshire Agricultural Society confirmed a "substance" was used on the cow's udders, contravening show rules.
Chief Executive Nigel Pulling said the competitor's animal had been banned with immediate effect.
"We take any allegation of tampering very seriously as the welfare of animals is paramount," he said.
The Society confirmed the breach was discovered on Tuesday, the first day of the show in Harrogate.
The animal and others entered by the exhibitor have been barred from taking part in the event for three years.
The competitor can appeal.
The show's rules state any interference with an animal which has an affect on its milk flow will lead to disqualification.
