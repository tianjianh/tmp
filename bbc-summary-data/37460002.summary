[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 5-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chester scored five second-half goals as they recorded their biggest win of the season at home to Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There was little to choose between the sides in the first half, before the goal deluge began with two inside a minute just after the interval.
Kane Richards' pass released Johnny Hunt to put Chester ahead on 51 minutes before James Alabi quickly doubled their lead after a powerful run.
Chester then scored three more in the final 11 minutes, triggered by Elliott Durrell firing home from the penalty spot after being fouled himself.
James Akintunde then teed up winger Craig Mahon to blast in a piledriver.
Substitute Akintunde still had time to get in on the act, heading in Durrell's left-wing cross, to complete City's biggest win in seven months and lift Jon McCarthy's side into the National League top half.
Chester's fifth successive game without conceding a goal is their best run at this level or above in 14 years, matching the five clean sheets with which they started the 2002-03 season.
