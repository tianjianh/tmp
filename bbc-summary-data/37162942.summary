The proposed new single carriageway would also connect the Inshes and Smithton areas of the city.
The road, which has been planned for several years, forms part of the Â£315m Inverness City Region Deal.
Transport Minister Humza Yousaf said public views were being sought on the six options.
He said: "When completed the new road will improve the operation of the road network around Inverness both for those travelling long distances and those making local journeys and at the same time improve safety for motorised and non-motorised users of the route.
"This scheme is being taken forward as part of the Inverness and Highland City-Region Deal and we are working closely with our colleagues in Highland Council to ensure that our scheme fits with their development plan for the area east of the A9."
The options are being exhibited at Inverness's Inshes Church until 19:00 on Tuesday and at Smithton Church from midday to 19:00 on Wednesday.
They are also available online.
