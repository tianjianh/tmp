[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barrow 1-1 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Neill Byrne bundled home a late equaliser as Macclesfield rescued a draw at fellow National League high-flyers Barrow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Irish defender struck eight minutes from time after Danny Livesey looked to have put the hosts on course for victory with a headed opener three minutes earlier.
Bluebirds forward Jordan Williams came closest to breaking the deadlock in a tight first half, firing his first opportunity over the crossbar before being denied by Macc goalkeeper Scott Flinders minutes later.
Barrow, who were eight games unbeaten going into the game, eventually edged in front when captain Livesey rose to nod in Williams' 79th-minute cross.
But they were denied all three points as Byrne grabbed his first goal of the season.
