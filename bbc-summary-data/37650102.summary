Football's crisis-hit world governing body Fifa says it is still working to regain trust as it launches its "vision for the future".

In a new document called 'Fifa 2.0' the organisation has outlined its key goals following widespread corruption allegations.
President Gianni Infantino said Fifa was building an organisation to "set the standards for others to follow".
Fifa also wants to take over organising the World Cup after Qatar 2022.
As it stands, host countries are in charge of running the tournament.
"Fifa is a stronger institution today than it was a year ago - and it will be even stronger a year from now," said secretary-general Fatma Samoura.
Dozens of senior officials were indicted by US prosecutors as a result of the Fifa corruption scandal in 2015, which is said to have involved racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering.
Former Fifa and Uefa presidents Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini both received eight-year bans from all football-related activities, reduced on appeal to six years, while a Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is also ongoing.
Jerome Valcke, the former Fifa secretary-general, was also given a 12-year ban from football in February, which was reduced to 10 years on appeal, for his alleged involvement in a scheme to profit from the sale of World Cup tickets.
Under its new plan Fifa says it wants to take control of ticketing arrangements and bring them in-house in time for the 2022 tournament.
Fifa's new vision is guided by four key principles - improving transparency, accountability, inclusivity and cooperation - and aims to move the body on from the crisis of recent years.
Changes will also be made to the World Cup bidding process, making it more transparent and efficient while also giving Fifa the power to bar contenders if they fail to match technical criteria.
• Increase percentage of world's population participating in football from 45% to 60% - includes people playing, coaching, refereeing or otherwise broadly experiencing football.
• Investment of more than $4bn (£3.27bn) in developing football, giving back to the game the resources derived from its showcase competitions and new, technology-driven, sources of revenue.
• Doubling the number of female players to 60 million.
