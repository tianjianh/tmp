The makers of Wallace and Gromit have filmed what they hope to be the world's largest stop-motion animation.

The motion picture, called 'Gulp' is the story of a lone fisherman who gets eaten by a fish, and is set on Pendine Sands, Carmarthenshire.
About 30 volunteers and sand artists helped make the video, shot with three mobile phones from a cherry-picker.
Aardman Animations also broke a world record for creating the smallest stop-motion animated character in 2010.
Will Studd, Gulp's co-director, said: "The film was a huge test of planning and coordination with Mother Nature.
"We were incredibly lucky with conditions and tide times, sometimes we got our final frame for the day just as the waves crashed in around our set."
He said a "canvas" of 42.71 metres (141ft) by 24 metres (79ft) had been used, shooting up to 75 frames per day with mobile phones.
He added: "Obviously, the turnaround had to be so quick with such a short window."
A video of how the project was put together has also been posted on the web.
