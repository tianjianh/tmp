The 18-year-old has been named locally as Kris McDowell, who worked at the Splash leisure centre at Plas Madoc.
Police are investigating the incident, which happened early on Tuesday, but say his death is not suspicious.
A file has been sent to North East Wales coroner John Gittins and an inquest is expected to open next week.
Friends of the teenager, who lived at Cefn Mawr, have posted tributes on Facebook and staff from his workplace in Acrefair expressed their thoughts in a statement.
It said: "It is with great heartfelt sadness that we have learned that a young member of our team at Splash at Plas Madoc Leisure Centre sadly passed away on Monday night, following a tragic accident.
"Kris McDowell was a bright and lively addition to our team and he was proud to be a part of Splash.
"He began working with us as a recreation assistant and had recently qualified as a lifeguard, something which we were all extremely proud of him for achieving.
"Darrell Wright, chairman of the Splash Community Trust, has expressed his great sorrow at losing such a special lad.
"Everyone at Splash, staff, volunteers and customers, send their thoughts and prayers to Kris's family and friends. He was well loved and very popular and he will be very much missed."
