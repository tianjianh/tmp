The 30-year-old had treatment on the touchline after being caught by Olivier Giroud's boot, but returned bandaged up to score a late equaliser at Anfield.
The Slovakian posted an image of the injury on his Instagram account.
He wrote: "Disappointed with the result but happy to score that late goal and help the team to get at least a point."
Skrtel also required staples in a head wound in January 2014 following a clash with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman during an FA Cup tie.
The centre-back also continued on that occasion, as Liverpool won 2-0 at the Goldsands Stadium.
