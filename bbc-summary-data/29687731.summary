UKIP Calypso song: Did Mike Read get his facts right?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It's got six choruses, it's sung with a dodgy Caribbean accent and UKIP supporters are hoping it will go to number one.

In case you haven't already heard it, the UKIP Calypso song has been recorded by former Radio 1 DJ Mike Read, who is a big supporter of the party.
Some people have said that they have found his mock accent insensitive.
He's released the track to help raise money for UKIP.
But the party's leader Nigel Farage has appealed to supporters to help get it to the top of the official chart.
Not surprisingly, it's full of claims about the EU and immigration and what UKIP would do if they got in power, so we decided to check if they got their facts right.
1. "Tax payers money, where does it go?  Not even George Osborne knows"
We're off to a questionable start. Knowledge of how taxpayers money is spent is fairly high up on the job description for any Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, UKIP would claim the government don't know where taxpayers money ends up if it goes towards the EU.
2. "When we're in power and we engage there will be no tax on minimum wage"
True.  The chances of UKIP getting into power might be slim but they have promised to not tax those on the minimum wage if it happens. Last month, UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC  "We're going to push very hard for there to be no tax on the minimum wage."
3. "Our leaders committed a cardinal sin. Open the borders let them all come in. Illegal immigrants in every town"
It's difficult to measure how many people are living in the UK illegally but a study last year by the London School of Economics estimated the number to be around 800,000 with the majority (70%) living in London.  We might be nitpicking here but it's very difficult to work out if there are illegal immigrants living in every town of the UK.
4. "With Jean-Claude Juncker we're giving away 55 million every day"
In case you didn't know, Jean-Claude Juncker is about to become the next President of one of the EU's top institutions, the European Commission. The claim that EU membership costs Britain Â£55 million everyday has been made on several occasions by Nigel Farage's party.  What he doesn't mention is that after you deduct the money we get back, it's closer to Â£33m per day.
5. "The EU live in wonderland tried to ban bent bananas and British jam"
You could argue the bananas claim is sort of true.  Several years ago the EU said anyone who wanted to sell bananas in Europe had to make sure they weren't 'abnormally' bent.  It didn't define how bendy an 'abnormally' bent banana was.  The jam ban claim is more straightforward. EU officials say it's completely untrue.
6. "The daily polls suggest somehow UKIP are the third party now"
True. UKIP may only have one MP in Parliament but they've been polling ahead of the Liberal Democrats for the last two years. In May, the party came first in the European elections
7. "Meanwhile down at on Clacton-on-Sea UKIP are making history. Douglas Carswell is quite adamant he will be the first MP in parliament"
In case you missed it, this has already happened.  Former Tory MP Douglas Carswell was elected as UKIP's first MP after his victory in the Clacton by-election.
