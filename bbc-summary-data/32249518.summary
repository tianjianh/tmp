Twitter just upped its election game.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The company have just released a series of General Election themed hashflags - graphics which appear when the parties are hashtagged.
The hashflag first appeared for the 2010 world cup, and was reintroduced for the 2014 tournament.
Ten parties have been given the flags, so if you type #conservatives, for example, their party logo appears next to the hashtag.
Labour, The Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the Greens, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Respect are also included.
