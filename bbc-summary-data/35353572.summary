A former homeless hostel in Salford is to be transformed into a training centre for young people.

Petrie Court, on Cromwell Road in Lower Kersal, will be given a £2m refurbishment to create a computer suite, gym and accommodation.
The plan is that it will provide people aged 16 to 25 with a place to live while they work or complete training.
Lee Sugden, chief executive at Salix Homes, said the project is "fantastic news for the young".
He said it would "provide much-needed opportunities for those who desperately want to work and make something with their lives, but are struggling to hold down a job or go to college because of their unsuitable or unstable living arrangements".
Petrie Court previously provided supported accommodation to young homeless people, but closed down in 2014 as part of Salford Council's funding cuts.
The project has received £1m funding from the Homes and Communities Agency, which will be matched by Salix Homes.
It is hoped the facility will be open by summer.
