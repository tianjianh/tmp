More than 1,100 men have claimed they were abused at Medomsley in County Durham during the 1970s and 80s.
Durham Police have been interviewing former members of staff as part of a long-running investigation.
A spokesman said two men aged 58 and 69 had been arrested on suspicion of sexual and physical assault.
Interviews with former employees at the centre began in November 2014, and 16 had been identified and spoken to, he said.
The majority attended local police stations voluntarily, the spokesman said, however two were arrested and questioned before being released on police bail.
"Efforts are also in hand to trace and interview at least a dozen more former members of staff," he added.
The investigation was triggered after former prison officer Neville Husband was jailed for eight years in 2003 for abusing five youths.
The publicity surrounding the trial led to others coming forward and he was subsequently jailed for another two years for further attacks.
He died in 2010, after being released from prison.
His former colleague Leslie Johnson, who was jailed for six years in 2005, has also since died.
Since August 2013, a total of 1,123 men have contacted detectives to report they were victims of either sexual or physical assaults at Medomsley.
