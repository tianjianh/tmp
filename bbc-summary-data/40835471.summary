[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chester 0-0 FC Halifax Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Halifax's wait for their first National League goal this season continues as they were held to a goalless draw by Chester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Shayman Ross Hannah stabbed wide from eight yards out with the first real chance after four minutes.
Halifax striker Tom Denton then had a 36th-minute header cleared off the line, a rare chance during a quiet opening 45 minutes.
The visitors came closest to a goal in the 56th minute when a cross from substitute Josh MacDonald came back off the bar.
Chester almost stole the points in the final minute, but Halifax goalkeeper Sam Johnson made a stunning stop to deny James Akintunde.
After having their trip to Solihull postponed on the opening weekend of the season, City's second successive draw leaves them still without a home win in 13 attempts this year.
Halifax are also on two points after a second successive away goalless draw to follow their opening-day defeat by Aldershot.
