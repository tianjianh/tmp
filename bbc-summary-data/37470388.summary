The 34-year-old former England front man says there is more to come as Bluebirds prepare to play Derby.
"It doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to score goals, but performance-wise, fitness-wise it's only going to get better," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"That first one it took me four games, but I'm off the mark now and I'm looking forward to Tuesday."
The win over Rotherham lifted Cardiff out of the Championship relegation zone and ended a run of four consecutive defeats.
Derby visit the Welsh capital on Tuesday who having dropped into the relegation places - one place and two points behind the Bluebirds.
Lambert says it is important for Cardiff to build on the win at the New York Stadium and climb the table.
"Our aim is to be in and around the play-offs," he added.
"I'm not saying because we've got three points that we're going to get there - we're nowhere near that level yet - but we've made a small step and that's all we can do."
Lambert has scored 216 goals in 592 league appearances since his career began as a trainee at Blackpool in 1998.
But he had played little football in the past two seasons having become out of favour at West Brom.
He added: "Scoring goals will help me confidence wise - and so will going from two years not playing to playing 90 minutes.
"I was hoping to get on the score sheet as soon as possible to help my team-mates and get us some points again.
"It's a small step to where we want to go so I'm made up."
