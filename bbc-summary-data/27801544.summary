Glasgow School of Art is staging its 2014 degree show, three weeks after fire destroyed and damaged students' work in the iconic Mackintosh building.

More than 500 graduating students are having their work showcased.
A special display of large-scale digital prints of work by all 102 fine art students is being staged at the nearby McLellan Galleries.
They are also being compiled into a book which is being sold to raise money for those who lost work in the fire.
The preview of the degree show on Thursday is a ticket-only event. The show opens to the public on Saturday.
It features work by graduating students across the School of Design and the Mackintosh School of Architecture.
The Architecture and Design show is taking place in the new Reid Building and the city's Glue Factory is hosting the Master of Fine Art show.
Fine art students - whose work was worst-affected by the fire - have each provided an image for a special exhibition of digital prints at the nearby McLellan Galleries.
Glasgow School of Art director, Professor Tom Inns, said: "It has been a particularly challenging time for our fine art students and this exhibition ensures that although they are unable to stage a degree show at this time, they are able to join with their fellow students across the campus in our annual showcase of creativity and innovation."
The show comes almost three weeks after 200 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at the Mackintosh building on 23 May.
They managed to salvage 90% of the structure of the A-listed building and save up to 70% of its contents.
A fund launched to raise cash for the restoration of the Mackintosh building has attracted millions of pounds in pledges.
