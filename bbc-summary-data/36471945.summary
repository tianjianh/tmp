Teenager Greg Taylor has signed a new three-year contract at Kilmarnock as manager Lee Clark eyes 11 new players ahead of pre-season training.

The 18-year-old left-back, who joined Kilmarnock after leaving Rangers two years ago, made his first three appearances at the end of the season.
It is understood deals have been agreed with around five players from England.
Kilmarnock, who avoided relegation via the play-offs, are also hoping to secure a number of players on loan.
The Scottish Premiership club released eight players and placed seven others on the transfer list at the end of the season.
But they are keen to extend the contracts of defender Miles Addison and forward Rory McKenzie and remain confident that they are near agreements with both.
Taylor, who can play left-back or in midfield, was delighted with his new deal and told Kilmarnock's website: "This is a great opportunity for me.
"I have been at Kilmarnock for almost two years now and feel my game is constantly improving.
"There is a great atmosphere at the club and I can't wait to get back in training with the boys under the management of Lee Clark."
Clark, who took charge in February after the departure of Gary Locke, is looking to rebuild his squad after his side finished second bottom in the top flight.
They retained their place in the top flight by defeating Championship runners-up Falkirk 4-1 on aggregate in the play-off final.
Clark hopes to add the 11 players before the start of pre-season training at the end of June.
