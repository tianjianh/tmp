A 2014 BBC investigation found that 17 of England's top-flight clubs failed to provide enough wheelchair spaces.
At the moment, 15 out of 20 clubs will have to increase capacity to comply with guidelines on accessible stadiums.
Earlier on Monday, a government report had criticised the inadequate facilities and support for disabled fans at Premier League grounds.
Minister for disabled people Justin Tomlinson MP had said "common sense can fix" some issues, but accepted other areas "will need some work".
"Frankly, some of it is disgraceful," he told BBC Sport. "There isn't provision in some grounds, supporters are split up or are put in with the away fans. I find that totally unacceptable.
"We are in the last chance saloon with those football bodies saying: 'You need to get your house in order.' We need to get this addressed."

A Premier League statement said: "We are undertaking our own assessment by surveying every Premier League stadium to determine improvements for disabled access.
"Disability access was discussed at the Premier League shareholders meeting last week with several new proposals agreed."
Monday's report - done jointly by the Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Culture, Media and Sport - recommends:
In August, a survey carried out by charity Revitalise before the start of the new Premier League season suggested that many clubs are continuing to fail disabled fans.
It followed the second reading of the Accessible Sports Grounds Bill in the House of Lords in July, where Lord Holmes of Richmond - Britain's most successful Paralympic swimmer - called on Premier League sponsors and broadcasters to pull out of football unless progress was made in providing facilities for disabled fans.
In June, top-flight clubs were threatened with legal action after the Equality and Human Rights Commission said it had received a number of complaints, including about Manchester United removing walking aids from away fans.
At the time United said it was "actively working" with its own disabled supporters association and the Premier League to "assess areas for potential improvement".
