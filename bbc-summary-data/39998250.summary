Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised the importance of north east Wales as a general election battleground when she launched her party's Welsh manifesto on Tuesday.

The event was held in the village of Gresford in the constituency of Wrexham - currently held by Labour but targeted by the Tories.
Like other Welsh manifestos, the document restates many of the pledges made at a UK level. You can find more about those here.
The Conservatives' Welsh manifesto says that Britain needs "strong and stable leadership to make the most of the opportunities Brexit brings for hardworking families".
It says that Theresa May "passionately believes in the precious bond between Wales, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, and the union is at the heart of her programme for government".
A foreword by Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns says: "The strength of our commitment to Wales is seen through our determination to deliver more jobs for ordinary, working people, more investment in Welsh infrastructure and a fair funding deal for the people for Wales."
Specifically Welsh pledges in the manifesto include promises to:
The Conservatives promise an industrial strategy with Wales at its "heart".
"We have the fastest economic growth per head outside London since 2010 and the value of Welsh exports has more than doubled since 1999," it says.
The Tories say they would abolish business rates for small firms with rateable values up to Â£15,000 and would seek to reform them - although this is devolved and the party would need to win power in the assembly elections in 2021 to do it.
The party also promises to:
Pledges include:
The party promises:
The document says the Conservative party has delivered on a commitment to provide a "stronger" devolution settlement for Wales, pointing to the recent Wales Act, with a recent agreement promising a "fair level" of funding.
But it adds that the UK government has in the past tended to "devolve and forget". The party promises that a future Conservative government will "put that right".
Working closely with the Welsh Government "will not be the limit of our actions in Wales", the document said.
The party envisages that the powers of the Welsh Government will increase as the UK leaves the EU, and promises that no decision-making powers devolved will be taken back to Westminster.
The Conservatives claim that PISA league tables show that in Wales "life is still largely determined not by your efforts and talents but by where you come from, who your parents are and what schools you attend".
It acknowledges that education is devolved, however, and says the Welsh Conservatives will work with colleagues in the assembly "to improve standards and extend choice so that our children and young people can compete with the best in the world".
It lists a number of pledges which the Conservatives would be able to implement if the party won the 2021 assembly election, including:
Health and social care is devolved in Wales. The Tories claim that the Labour-led Welsh Government has let down doctors, nurses and hospital staff by a failure to invest.
"The founding intention for the NHS was to provide good levels of care to everyone, wherever they live,"  the manifesto claims.
"This has not been achieved in Wales over recent times," the document says.
The manifesto makes pledges that would need to be implemented at assembly level and would require the Conservatives to be in a position to lead the next Welsh Government after 2021. They include:
In addition there are pledges to:
The manifesto also says the party will:
