School's inset day move to save parents holiday money

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Newport school will take all its inset days in the same week so parents can save money on family holidays.

Parents at Eveswell Primary School have been told the five days will be taken in one block and added on to the end of Whitsun half term in June 2016.
Schools traditionally spread the teacher training days across the year.
Head teacher Catherine Barnett said she hoped it would discourage parents from taking children out of school for holidays during term time.
"There will be five training days for staff where the school is closed to pupils," Mrs Barnett said.
"It has been decided to take these as one whole week with the hope that cheaper holidays can be booked and therefore holidays will not affect attendance at other times in the year."
It comes as councils have started fining parents for their children's unauthorised absences.
Parent Gemma Thomas said of the move: "If every school did this but chose a different week to other council areas it would be completely fantastic for families."
Fellow parent Kirsty Powles said: "I was very happy to see this in a letter this week - I think it's a fab idea."
