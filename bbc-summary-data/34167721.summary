Lake District fall woman airlifted to hospital

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 70-year-old woman had to be airlifted to hospital after she was seriously hurt in a fall in the Lake District.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Patterdale Mountain Rescue team was called out after she suffered head and neck injuries while walking on St Sunday Crag, Ullswater, on Saturday.
She was treated at the scene before being flown by Great North Air Ambulance to the major trauma centre at the Royal Preston Hospital.
The condition of the woman, from Preston, has been described as stable.
Mountain rescue volunteers thanked members of the local football team, which allowed the final few minutes of its home game to be disrupted so the helicopter could land outside the Patterdale base.
