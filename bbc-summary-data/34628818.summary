The 2-1 home loss to Swansea. sees Villa, who have not won since the opening day of the season, remain second-bottom of the table, four points from safety.
"Am I going to be in the job next week? I'm not the person to ask," said Sherwood, who took charge at Villa Park in February.
"I feel like the club is in a hole."
The former England midfielder, sacked from his previous job by Tottenham despite leading them to sixth place during the 2013-14 season, is not concerned about the axe.
"No, it's out of my control," added Sherwood.
"I can only control what I can control, and on Monday I'll be working as hard I've done since I came to this club."
Sherwood joked he will avoid a call from the board if it wants to sack him.
"I'll just turn my phone off," he said.
Ghana international Jordan Ayew gave Villa the lead, before Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised with a 25-yard free-kick. Jordan's brother Andre then grabbed the winner for Swansea, three minutes from time.
"I am disappointed with the result, we didn't deserve to lose the game," the ex-Spurs boss told BBC Sport.
"We can't carry anyone because we're getting done. At the moment we are short.
"If people don't give everything we'll come up short. There's no shortage in desire but the quality is not quite there.
"We're not world beaters. Our league position suggests were not and today wasn't our day."
Sherwood, who led Villa to Premier League safety and the FA Cup final last season, said his team were "in a mess", but was optimistic they would get out their predicament.
"I am gutted we haven't got anything from the game. It's not about me personally," he told Sky Sports.
"I believe we will get out of it and this club will be in the Premier League next season. I'm expecting them to improve to win enough games."
