Rory McIlroy fired a two-over-par 73 to lie level par, 12 behind leader Henrik Stenson, with Phil Mickelson 11 under.
The world number four's round included four bogeys, including three on the front nine, and just two birdies.
Darren Clarke also carded a 73 and is three over while Graeme McDowell's 72 left him back on five over.
McDowell picked up shots at the first and 16th holes but his round was marred by a triple bogey at the par-three eighth.
Clarke, the 2011 champion, dropped shots at three of the last four holes.

McIlroy, the victor two years ago, rued the poor start to his round which denied him any momentum in his challenge to re-gain the title.
"The first seven holes are where you need to make your score and make birdies but I made early bogeys and picked up just a couple of shots," said McIlroy.
"I had chances for birdies at the seventh, eighth and ninth holes but wasn't able to convert. The speed and the wind were factors in me missing those putts.
"I was never really comfortable over them because of the wind and it was tough to commit to something - that's why I missed a few short ones."
Twice former champion Padraig Harrington birdied the last to salvage a 73 and lie two over ahead of Sunday's final round.
