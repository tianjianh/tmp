[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mollie Robinson followed Lena Clarke as she walked home from her church in Inverness before attacking her in a street at about 21:45 on 25 January.
The mother-of-two, formerly of Aviemore and living in Inverness at the time, was seen by witnesses and on CCTV.
She was jailed at Inverness Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Gordon Fleetwood told Robinson: "You quite deliberately targeted a 79-year-old lady late at night on her way home, to satisfy your need for drugs."
