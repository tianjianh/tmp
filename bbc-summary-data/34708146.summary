[SN]TITLE[SN]
Army beasting victim involved in 'drunken incidents'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A junior soldier who died of heatstroke after being subjected to an informal Army punishment known as "beasting" was involved in a series of drunken incidents beforehand, an inquest heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Gavin Williams, 22, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, was serving with the Second Battalion of the Royal Welsh Regiment at Lucknow Barracks in Wiltshire.
He was punished for the incidents and disobedience in July 2006.
Tests showed his body temperature was 41.7C, the normal temperature is 37C.
Tests also showed he had ecstasy in his body when he died.
Three non-commissioned officers who carried out the punishment - Sgt Russell Price, 45, Sgt Paul Blake, 37, and Cpl John Edwards, 42, were found not guilty of manslaughter by a jury at Winchester Crown Court in 2008.
An inquest into Pte Williams's death, being held at Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court in Salisbury, heard he had been out drinking on the weekend before his death and is thought to have taken ecstasy in a nightclub, although none of his friends saw him take drugs.
When he returned to his barracks there was an incident with a fire extinguisher in which guests of an officer were sprayed with water, the inquest heard.
Later that morning Pte Matthews turned up unfit for guard duty and was incorrectly dressed and smelling of alcohol, so was sent away to sort himself out and told to report to his superiors on the Monday.
The following day, he was subjected to the beasting.
Pte Michael Matthews drove past Pte Williams and described him being "yakked" - a form of extreme physical exercise - by Cpl Edwards.
He said in a statement: "You could see he was draining out. Gavin obviously did something wrong which is why he was being marched but it did seem to be going on a little bit too much in the heat."
Earlier, the inquest heard from Pte Ledua Vasukiviwa, who saw Pte Williams after his night out said he was convinced he had taken drugs because of his behaviour.
"He was sweating all over profusely. The only thing that came into my mind was that they were taking drugs," his statement said.
"Gavin seemed very stressed and kept putting his fingertips to the side of his head and closing his eyes as if he was in deep thought."
The hearing continues.
