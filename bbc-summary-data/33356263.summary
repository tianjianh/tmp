Coates played 13 times for the Black Cats on loan last season, helping them stay in the Premier League.
The 24-year-old Uruguay international, who has been playing at the Copa America, is Dick Advocaat's first signing as Sunderland head coach.
Coates made just 17 starts in his four years at Liverpool, who have already completed six summer signings.
Advocaat's predecessor Gus Poyet brought Coates to Wearside in September and he returned from injury to play a key role in the club's successful fight against relegation.
He is set to return for pre-season training next week after being given extra time off following his international exertions.
Sunderland owner Ellis Short has made funds available for Advocaat to strengthen his squad.
Sporting director Lee Congerton said: "Sebastian was an important part of the team under Dick last season, and we're delighted that he has joined us on a permanent basis.
"He has Premier League experience and after spending last season on loan with us, he will be able to settle into the team very quickly."
