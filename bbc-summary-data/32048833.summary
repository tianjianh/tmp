Gloster Javelin arrives at Jet Age Museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last surviving aircraft of its kind has arrived at a museum in Gloucestershire where it will go on permanent display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The FAW 4 Gloster Javelin was built in the county in 1956, and has spent more than two decades at the gates of RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire.
The Jet Age Museum at Staverton bought it from the Ministry of Defence for an undisclosed sum last December.
The aeroplane, which has no engine and is not airworthy, will now be restored.
It spent much of its operational life as a test and trials aircraft at the GAC (Gloster Aircraft Company) in Hucclecote, which built planes using jet engines designed by British engineer Sir Frank Whittle.
More than 250,000 people have visited the museum, one of whose patrons is Sir Frank's son Ian, since it reopened in August 2013.
