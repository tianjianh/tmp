A new cafe could be built on Colwyn Bay promenade as part of multi-million council plans to regenerate the waterfront.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 0.6 mile (1km) stretch of the road closed on Thursday morning and diversions put in place for the second stage of redevelopment work.
The first phase in 2013 included a water sports centre and beach.
Conwy council is also looking for expressions of interest to run the new-build catering facility.
Work on the latest phase combines upgrading coastal defences with environmental improvements between the pier and the eastern section of Cayley Embankment.
It includes widening, realigning and raising a section of the existing promenade, improving parking and new landscaping.
Councillor Dave Cowans, chairman of the project board, said: "The regeneration of Colwyn Bay waterfront and the new beach have proven to be an overwhelming success in attracting visitors to the resort.
"An integral part of the strategy is to provide new business opportunities, and as such, we're commissioning a new-build catering facility on the promenade."
