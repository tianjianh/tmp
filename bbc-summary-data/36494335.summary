England fly-half Owen Farrell is developing the composure of a "world great", according to his international coach Eddie Jones.

The Saracens back, 24, has replaced George Ford for Saturday's opening Test against Australia in Brisbane.
"He's always been a physical, in-your-face sort of player," Jones said.
"Now he's got a greater appreciation of how you win games of rugby. He sits back, has a look where the space is and is a bit calmer about his decisions."
Bath fly-half Ford has been struggling with form and confidence, having missed six out of seven kicks at goal during the 27-13 warm-up victory over Wales at Twickkenham at the end of May.
In contrast, Farrell's improvement during a successful domestic season has impressed Jones.
Referring to New Zealand legend Dan Carter and England World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson, Jones said he wanted Farrell to become "unflappable".
"All the great 10s in the world, they never look like they've got a hair out of place," he said. "That's what you want from your 10.
"When you're a big, physical guy like Owen is, you develop that through experience and maturity and that's what he's starting to do now."
Luther Burrell replaces Farrell at inside centre, while Marland Yarde is picked on the wing ahead of Jack Nowell, who is named as a replacement.
Former captain Chris Robshaw is back on the blind-side after missing the Wales win to attend his brother's wedding.
England: 15. Mike Brown; 14. Anthony Watson, 13. Jonathan Joseph, 12. Luther Burrell, 11. Marland Yarde; 10. Owen Farrell, 9. Ben Youngs; 1. Mako Vunipola, 2. Dylan Hartley, 3. Dan Cole, 4. Maro Itoje,  5. George Kruis, 6. Chris Robshaw, 7. James Haskell, 8. Billy Vunipola.
Replacements: 16. Luke Cowan-Dickie, 17. Matt Mullan, 18. Paul Hill, 19. Joe Launchbury, 20. Courtney Lawes, 21. Danny Care, 22. George Ford, 23. Jack Nowell.
