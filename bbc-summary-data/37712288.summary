Gable Tostee, 30, was charged after Warriena Wright, 26, fell from his balcony in Queensland's Gold Coast in August 2014.
Prosecutors argued that she was so intimidated that she tried to escape by climbing to a lower floor, but fell.
After four days of deliberation, the jury found him not guilty of murder and manslaughter.
Defence lawyer Nick Dore said outside the court that his client was "relieved this matter is now behind him and he's looking forward to moving on with his life".
Mr Tostee and Ms Wright connected on the popular dating app Tinder and exchanged messages back and forth.
They met in person for the first time on 7 August 2014 at a seaside resort called Surfers Paradise. Hours later Ms Wright plunged to her death from his 14th storey balcony.
During the trial, the key piece of evidence was a 199-minute audio recording of her pleading to be allowed to leave the apartment.
The recording was found on Mr Tostee's phone after he made a decision to secretly record their altercation before Ms Wright's fall, according to the Australian media.
Prosecutors said the recording proved his guilt, while his defence lawyers said it showed he was innocent.
Mr Tostee can be heard saying Ms Wright physically assaulted him after allegedly throwing ornamental rocks at him.
"You're lucky I haven't chucked you off my balcony," Mr Tostee says on the recording made on his phone. "If you try to pull anything, I'll knock you out."
Ms Wright is later heard saying "just let me go home", after he allegedly locked her on the balcony.
