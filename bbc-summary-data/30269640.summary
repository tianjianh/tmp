Greater Manchester Police said he was attacked by a man who started arguing with him on Santiago Street, Rusholme, at about 16:00 GMT on Saturday.
The victim tried to back away but was punched by the other man who was driven off in a dark-coloured saloon car.
Det Ch Insp Terry Crompton said: "We believe this is a targeted attack which has left a man fighting for his life."
The man was found collapsed on the street and is being treated in Hope Hospital, Salford for serious head injuries.
The attack happened in a street of terraced houses about five minutes' walk away from Manchester's "Curry Mile" of restaurants and take-aways.
Det Ch Insp Crompton said: "From what we know, the victim was walking on Santiago Street when he was approached by a man who started arguing with him.
"The victim tried to back away but the man punched him, knocking him to the ground."
"I believe there would have been a number of witnesses in the area who saw what happened and I would urge them to call us."
