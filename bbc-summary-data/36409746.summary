Wood, 28, carded a three-under-par 69 on the final round to finish one shot ahead of Rikard Karlberg, who struck a stunning 65, including a hole-in-one.
"It is the biggest win of my career, I have always wanted to win the tournament and to win with my family here is amazing," Wood said.
Masters champion Danny Willett slipped off the lead to finish third.
A poor 76 in the third round cost Willett the title, as he finished on seven under par, two shots behind Wood.
Bristol's Wood was fifth after the third day, but held his nerve with one eagle and a further five birdies to claim his third European Tour triumph.
"It's such a massive release to get over the line," he told BBC Radio 5 live.
"I always think if you're within four shots going into the last day then you have a chance. It was such a bunched leaderboard going into the final round it could have been anybody's, but I came out on top."
Australia's Scott Hend, the overnight leader, finished tied 15th after suffering a shocking final round 78 that featured three double-bogies and five bogies.
Wood will now move into the world's top 25 and has an outside chance of making the Olympics. Englishmen Danny Willett (ninth) and Justin Rose (10th) currently occupy the two positions in the Great Britain team.
However, the 28-year-old might have to rearrange his summer schedule in order to fit in Rio.
"To play in the Olympics would be amazing, but I'm getting married the week after and my stag-do clashes at the moment with the Games," he said. "We'll have to keep an eye on it."
Analysis: BBC Sport golf correspondent Iain Carter:
"Wood started the final day three behind and covered the front nine in 29. It helped him open up a four-shot lead, but then the tall Bristolian was oblivious.
"He avoided looking at the leaderboard and that probably helped him in a shaky finish with four dropped shots on the way home. When his caddie told him to lay up at the last, he suspected a par would be enough and duly obliged.
"It was the third - and biggest - win of his career, taking him into the top 25 in the world, and makes him a probable for Europe's Ryder Cup team and a possible for the Rio Olympics."
