Blandford Cemetery wall and chapels win listed status

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Victorian cemetery wall has been saved from demolition after a Dorset resident succeeded in having it listed by Historic England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Madeleine Bridle said the wall, which runs behind gardens in a cul-de-sac, was "integral" to Blandford Forum.
The town council had decided to replace the section with a wooden fence due to its poor condition.
Historic England said the entire wall, cemetery gateway and two chapels had been granted a Grade ll listing.
The wall, which was built in the mid-1800s, has been damaged by the roots of several lime and sycamore trees which are subject to preservation orders, Blandford Town Council said.
The authority said it had made a failed attempt to list the chapels following an arson attack in September 2013.
It had planned to replace the wall with a wooden fence at a cost of Â£13,525, some of which would be offset by the sale of the bricks.
Ms Bridle, who lodged the application, said: "Why should we sell town property?"
"We don't want a fence replacing this beautiful 19th Century brick wall.
"It is integral to the character of the town."
Blandford town clerk Linda Scott-Giles said the wall would now be preserved.
She said a builder originally contracted to repair one section had given an estimate of Â£150,000 to rebuild the entire wall.
She said: "This is money we do not have. I don't know what we're going to do.
"We may have to put buttresses in people's gardens, but that's not something residents will want."
