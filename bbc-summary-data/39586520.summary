The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said: "A marked Derbyshire Police vehicle signalled for a Vauxhall Astra to stop close to the A38 near Hilton.
"Initial information indicates that the driver of the Astra failed to stop and a pursuit began.
"The pursuit was abandoned, but a short time later the car collided with two other vehicles and a pedestrian on Main Street."
The investigation will examine what happened before the crash to determine whether the police followed appropriate policies and procedures.
