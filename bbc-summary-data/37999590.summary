Arthur Heeler-Frood also apologised to the police "for the time they spent looking for me and for the worry I have caused family and friends".
The teenager, from Axminster, Devon, was found "safe and well" 10 miles away from his home on Tuesday.
He went missing on 6 September, saying he was "bored" with his life.
More on the returned teenager, and other news
Parents Jeremy and Caroline Heller-Frood said: "We are overjoyed to have Arthur home with us again; tired, grubby and rather smelly but otherwise none the worse for his experiences. We feel extremely lucky that he is safe and sound.
"Many thanks to Devon and Cornwall Police for their professionalism and their tireless search for Arthur."
Arthur's parents also expressed their "deep gratitude to all our friends and family who have supported us through this difficult time".
He went missing after leaving home for school.
The next day his parents received a letter from the teenager saying he would be back within a year and not to try to find him or make him come home.
His disappearance sparked a nationwide hunt and appeals to Facebook to help trace him.
Arthur took Â£350 in cash with him, but did not take his phone, passport or many belongings.
He was found in Honiton after a person saw him on a train travelling from Exeter and called police.
His parents said: "We now wish to spend some time in private with Arthur to settle him back home and to make some plans for his future."
