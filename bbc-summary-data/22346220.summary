Primark says it will pay compensation and offer emergency food aid to victims of the Bangladesh factory collapse who worked for its supplier.

The clothing store chain said its team in Bangladesh had been "working to put in place immediate and long-term help for victims of this disaster".
It said it would provide for children who had lost their parents.
A factory complex collapsed last Wednesday on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, killing some 350 people.
Primark said it would review the support to ensure it kept up with need.
The company occupied a floor of the collapsed building and the workers there were suppliers to the brand.
A statement from Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, said: "We have partnered with a local NGO [non-governmental organisation] to address the immediate needs of victims, including the provision of emergency food aid to families. This initiative began in Bangladesh immediately the extent of the disaster became clear.
"Primark will also pay compensation to the victims of this disaster who worked for its supplier.  This will include the provision of long-term aid for children who have lost parents, financial aid for those injured and payments to the families of the deceased."
It urged other retailers who used the building to also come forward and offer help and support to those affected.
Its move follows a recent call by the charity War On Want, which said firms who use Bangladeshi products must "safeguard the life of these workers".
Primark said it "accepts all its responsibilities in this disaster" and was providing assistance in the region.
A protest was held outside Primark's flagship store in London on Saturday.
