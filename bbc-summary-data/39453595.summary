Isle of Wight health chief quits ahead of CQC report

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The chief executive of the Isle of Wight NHS Trust has resigned ahead of the publication of a Care Quality Commission (CQC) report.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Karen Baker is standing down from the role two weeks after concerns were raised that the trust could be put into special measures.
Ms Baker said the CQC report would contain "important messages".
The executive medical director, Dr Mark Pugh, has been asked to stand in as acting chief executive.
Ms Baker had been in post for five years.
She said: "It is true that the NHS on the Isle of Wight - like elsewhere - faces many big challenges and it is clear to me that we have not always provided the quality of care the public expects. I am very sorry about that."
Ms Baker added that the trust needed a "fresh pair of eyes".
It comes after she had to reassure staff following newspaper reports the trust had received a draft copy of the CQC report and appointed an improvement director.
Ms Baker confirmed Philippa Slinger has been appointed to the role but a report was yet to be published.
She added: "It would be wrong to say more about this report before publication but I know it will contain some important messages about how we can improve healthcare on the island. I do not want questions about my own position to detract from these important messages."
Eve Richardson, chair of the trust, said: "It is a tribute to Karen that she was the first to recognise the need for a fresh start. Karen will not be receiving any kind of severance payment."
The trust board said it will be confirming an interim appointment in April and they will be in the role for up to six months, while the recruitment for a permanent chief executive takes place.
