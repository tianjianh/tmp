County Championship: Yorkshire hampered by rain and bad light at Hampshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Yorkshire's hopes of beating Hampshire were severely dented as rain and bad light meant only 19 overs were possible on day three at the Ageas Bowl.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors, who began the match five points behind Division One leaders Middlesex, only progressed to 143-2, with their lead standing at 202 runs.
Opener Adam Lyth (56) reached his half-century in a truncated morning session and was the only wicket to fall.
Lyth edged Brad Wheal (2-52) to slip, while Gary Ballance is 46 not out.
