Lisa Cobbold, 24, was pictured with non-league side Needham Market after a bridge collapse closed the M20 in Kent.
The team did not get her name but wanted to know if she made it to her wedding.
When friends saw her picture, she contacted the BBC from Las Vegas.
The Suffolk-based team, who were heading to an away game at Folkestone when they got stuck in the traffic jam on 27 August, were delighted to hear she became Mrs Kendall later that day - albeit two hours later than planned.

Mrs Kendall, from Welling, London, was heading to Detling when her two wedding vehicles, decked in ribbons, ground to a halt.
"I wasn't too worried as we were 15 minutes away, but then people showed us news reports about the bridge," she said.
The pedestrian bridge over the M20 collapsed after being hit by a lorry carrying a digger.
A motorcyclist suffered broken ribs when he threw himself from his bike to avoid hitting the bridge.
Mrs Kendall spotted the football team watching an impromptu cricket game on the closed carriageway.
"I didn't know who they were, but they were lovely lads and even said we could use the toilet on their coach," she said.
She had her photograph taken with them and the team later posted it on their website, saying they wanted to make sure she got to the church on time and congratulate her.
"Jake and I were on our honeymoon in Las Vegas when I got all these messages from people saying I was on the news.
"I said to Jake, 'it's OK, I'm only on the BBC'."
Mrs Kendall had made it to her wedding two hours late after part of the road was reopened.
"Everyone parted and let us go first. The football players all cheered as we drove through," she said.
Mrs Kendall, who changed into her wedding gown at the venue, said her husband-to be joked: "You like to keep me waiting, don't you. I thought you'd stood me up."
Mark Easlea, Needham Market FC's secretary, said the team "wishes them all the best for the future".
