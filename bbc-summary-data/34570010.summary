Emergency services were called to the Richford Motors depot on Fairfield Park industrial estate in Manvers near Rotherham at about 22:45 BST on Sunday.
Six fire engines tackled the blaze, which took several hours to put out.
Police said the fire caused "extensive damage" but no-one was believed to be injured.
Temporary Det Insp Steven Brookes said: "We are working closely with our colleagues from the fire service to gather as much information as we can.
"We do believe the fire was started deliberately and therefore I'd urge local residents to consider whether they saw or heard anything suspicious late last night in the Manvers area."
He said officers would continue with local inquiries and examining CCTV footage.
A spokesperson from the fire service said it could not comment on whether the incident was connected to an incident in which cars were deliberately set alight on Thursday in nearby Wath-upon-Dearne.
They were a people carrier on Church Street at 01:50, a Citroen van on Valley Drive at 02:05 and a people carrier on Montgomery Road at 02:30.
A Transit van on Norton Road in Wath was also set alight at 01:55. The fire service said it was still investigating the incidents.
