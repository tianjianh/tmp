Judge DW Deshpande said the actor would have to be present in the court for the judgement.
Khan has been charged with culpable homicide by the Mumbai court.
He recently told the court he was not driving on the night of the incident.
The actor also said his driver Altaf was driving the car when the crash occurred.
If convicted, he faces 10 years in prison.
Late on the night of 28 September 2002, Khan's Toyota Land Cruiser rammed into the American Express bakery in the Bandra area of Mumbai, authorities say.
The vehicle ran over five people sleeping on the streets, killing 38-year-old Noor Ullah Khan and seriously injuring three others. Another person received minor injuries.
The prosecution has alleged that Khan was driving the car and that he was drunk.
The actor, who has always denied the charges against him, recently told the court that he was not drunk and was not driving the car either.
Khan is one of Bollywood's biggest stars and has starred in more than 80 Hindi-language films.
Several of his films, including Dabangg, Ready, Bodyguard, Ek Tha Tiger, Maine Pyar Kiya and Hum Aap Ke Hain Kaun, have been huge commercial hits.
