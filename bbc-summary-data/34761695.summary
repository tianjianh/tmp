Carl Froch: Briton contemplates one-fight comeback

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world champion Carl Froch has said he would consider returning to the ring next spring for one fight to reclaim his title.

Froch, 38, who announced his retirement in July, has been training every day and predicted he would beat IBF super-middleweight champion James DeGale, 29.
"It's an easy job for me and he's world champion," said Froch.
"Get my old belt back, show them all how it's done and then retire. There'd be something satisfying about that."
Froch is a four-time world super-middleweight champion who won 33 of his 35 fights, 24 victories by knockout.
But the Nottingham boxer has not fought since he knocked out fellow Briton George Groves to retain the WBA and IBF titles in May 2014.

In May, DeGale beat Andre Dirrell on points to claim the vacant IBF super-middleweight belt and become the first Briton to win a professional world title and an Olympic gold.
Froch said if DeGale beats Romanian-born former IBF super-middleweight champion Lucian Bute in December that would give him motivation to return.
"I always said once I've retired, I won't come back, but 18 months on from my last fight, I'm starting to think to myself 'I'm fit, strong, in good shape'," said Froch.
"But it's a big if. I might just stick with poker. The desire's gone, it's getting the desire back. What would I need? It might be DeGale beating Bute."
