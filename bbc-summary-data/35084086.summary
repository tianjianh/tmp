[SN]TITLE[SN]
Court case heard in cells due to security staff shortage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A case had to be heard in the cells because there were not enough security staff to bring a defendant upstairs to court.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 36-year-old man from Blackrod, near Bolton, had been charged with sexual assault, criminal damage and assault, among other offences.
Officials at Llandudno Magistrates' Court, Conwy county, had to go to the cells on Saturday for the hearing.
The staff shortage was due to another prisoner being taken to hospital.
The man has also been charged with using violence to secure entry, harassment and driving with excess alcohol in Abergele.
Magistrates and lawyers were led into a large cell for the hearing which was brought about after security staff had to accompany another prisoner to hospital when he fell ill.
The case was sent to Caernarfon Crown Court for a hearing on 21 December.
