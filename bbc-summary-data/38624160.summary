Dwight Gayle: Newcastle await further update on top scorer's injury at Brentford

Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez says it is too early to know the full extent of the injuries suffered by his side in their 2-1 win at Brentford.

Championship top scorer Dwight Gayle put the visitors ahead and helped Newcastle return to the top of the table before going off injured.
Defender Isaac Hayden and midfielder Vurnon Anita were also forced off hurt.
"Gayle and Hayden have muscle problems. Anita was a bad tackle on his ankle," Benitez told BBC Radio Newcastle.
"But it is too early to know. Our club doctor will let me know."
The injuries come on top of striker Aleskandar Mitrovic being stretchered off with a nasty gash to his knee in last Saturday's FA Cup third-round defeat by Birmingham City at St Andrew's.
"I spoke with him and he is progressing," said Benitez. "He needs time. Normally they say two or three weeks."
But, while the Newcastle boss must wait to discover how long he might have to be without 20-goal top scorer Gayle, he does have Jonjo Shelvey available again after a five-game suspension for Wednesday night's FA Cup third-round replay with Birmingham at home.
He also has Daryl Murphy off and running, having followed up his FA Cup goal at St Andrew's with his first in the league for the club - Newcastle's late winner at Griffin Park.
Striker Sammy Ameobi has also returned from loan at Bolton Wanderers.
"To lose three players and see the reaction from the players is something that, as a manager, you have to be really pleased with," added Benitez. "And the fans should be proud too.
"We had to keep reacting to losing players, but, if you want to stay at the top, you have to show character."
