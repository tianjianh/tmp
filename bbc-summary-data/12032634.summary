Thermometers hit -19C in Pershore in the early hours, which was one of the lowest temperatures in the UK, BBC forecasters said.
There were still delays for motorists on the northbound section of the M5 between Birmingham and Worcester, as well as on sections of the M42.
Temperatures in the region were set to range between -1C and -15C on Sunday.
The Met Office has renewed its warning of severe weather across the West Midlands region.
It said there was a continued risk of widespread ice on untreated roads and pavements during Sunday and Monday.
West Midlands Ambulance Service urged people not to travel on "treacherously icy roads" unless necessary.
A spokeswoman said roads in the region were "littered with abandoned vehicles following the significant snowfall".
Parts of the M5 were severely affected by conditions on Saturday, with some drivers stuck in queues for more than three hours.
The ambulance service also urged people to consider vulnerable neighbours as the sub-zero temperatures continued.
"We would appeal for people to be aware of those who are elderly, frail or in some way vulnerable to this type of weather condition whether they are friends, neighbours or relatives," the spokeswoman said.
"Why not show some community spirit and ensure that people in these categories do not have to go out and risk hurting themselves by getting in any essential supplies that they might need."
The service, which saw its busiest day on Friday since regional records began, also urged people to use the service wisely so it could best serve patients with serious and life-threatening injuries.
Some flights at Birmingham Airport have been cancelled or delayed because of snowy conditions.
Travellers were urged to check the airport's website and with their flight operators for details.
