[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 2-3 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Promotion challengers Portsmouth fought back from 2-0 down to win at League Two's bottom club Newport County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On-loan players Josh Sheehan and Rhys Healey struck either side of the break for the hosts.
Ex-Newport midfielder Danny Rose hit back, but Kal Naismith fired a penalty high as the visitors dominated the latter stages.
Defender Enda Stevens levelled and midfielder Naismith made amends late on from a free kick to seal victory.
Newport County manager Graham Westley told BBC Radio Wales: "I've not gone in there and blasted them at all. It's disappointing, but if you let your emotion take over you can get angry about losing the lead.
"I'm sure there was a lot of angry people leaving the ground thinking 'how can you lose a two-goal lead?' Well you can lose a lead if you make mistakes that cost you goals against a good quality outfit."
