Anna McCallum crashed into John Gordon Sangster on Baltic Street, Montrose, as the 79-year-old stepped out to cross the road on 1 December, 2012.
Forfar Sheriff Court heard the 23-year-old, of Johnshaven, Aberdeenshire, was "momentarily distracted" by loud music playing in her Kia Picanto.
She pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving.
A police examination of the scene found McCallum had not braked hard in the lead up to the crash.
Investigators found the car's CD player was on, with the volume turned up loud. Several witnesses saw the crash, and none heard the car braking.
Fiscal depute Hannah Kennedy told the court: "There was no evidence of heavy braking at the locus and the distance beyond the impact where she stopped would suggest she was travelling at between 22 and 29 mph.
"The conclusion therefore was that the accused was listening to loud music, became momentarily distracted, and was unable to react to the appearance of the deceased on the road."
Mr Sangster suffered a life-threatening head injury and was treated at the roadside before being taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, where he died three days later.
Sheriff Gregor Murray deferred sentence until next month for social work background reports.
McCallum was released on bail in the meantime, but banned from driving in the interim.
