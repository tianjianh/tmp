Illegal dumping: Appeal over 20,000 tonnes of waste in County Tyrone

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The public is being asked to help find out who is responsible for dumping about 20,000 tonnes of illegal waste across four sites in County Tyrone.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) said "significant" volumes of waste has been found at Ballygawley, Sandholes and two sites in Galbally.
The agency said it included evidence of medical waste and may have originated from the Republic of Ireland.
The NIEA is delivering leaflets to 1,200 residents to appeal for details.
Some of the illegal waste has been buried while the rest has been dumped above ground.
As well as medical waste, the abandoned rubbish includes plastics, paper and textiles as well as broken glass contaminated with metals, plastics and paper.
Derek Williamson from NIEA's environmental crime unit, said local knowledge "could be key" to the investigation.
"The individuals carrying out these crimes are using lorries, diggers and machinery to transport, offload and bury this waste," he said.
"We are asking if anyone has seen any similar activity which you may be concerned about to contact us."
Households and businesses within a 3km radius of the illegal dumps will receive the NIEA leaflet.
Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said: "Illegal waste disposal is allowing criminals to profit whilst destroying our countryside.
"This must stop."
