DUP MLA Gregory Campbell defends 'schoolboy behaviour'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
DUP MLA Gregory Campbell has defended his actions after being barred by the assembly speaker over what has been described as "schoolboy behaviour".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin said Gregory Campbell had been "blatantly disrespectful" after he yawned loudly twice when Sinn FÃ©in member Caitriona Ruane had been speaking in Irish.
It happened last Monday.
Mr Campbell was barred from speaking on Monday and Tuesday.
"It can be tiring listening to Sinn Fein abusing the Irish language," said Mr Campbell.
"Has Caitriona Ruane nothing else better to do with her time than complain?
"Does this mean every time you blow your nose someone is going to say that's inappropriate nose blowing?
"This is ludicrous. It's nonsensical.
"If I was feeling somewhat tired I would yawn in Westminster too.
"Some people yawn quietly, some yawn loudly."
Last November, Mr Campbell was barred from addressing the Northern Ireland Assembly for a day for failing to apologise for an Irish language parody.
A row developed after he began his address to the assembly with: "Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer".
