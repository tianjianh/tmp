Support gained for proposals for The Storr in Skye

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Staffin Community Trust (SCT) believes it has gained support for its proposal to manage or buy land at The Storr in Skye.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The organisation has suggested creating a visitor centre and new parking to improve access to the Old Man of Storr and Trotternish Ridge.
A survey of local residents and groups on the idea closed last month.
SCT said early indications drawn from the results suggested there was support for its plans.
The trust has proposed managing or taking over 202 acres (82 hectares) of land at The Storr owned by Highland Council.
SCT has begun a more detailed analysis of the survey results and will hold further discussions with the local authority.
The trust regards The Storr to be "a vital entry point and economic driver" for Staffin because 70% of those who visited The Storr earlier this year then travelled north to Staffin.
The Old Man of Storr and Trotternish Ridge are among Skye's most recognisable landscapes.
