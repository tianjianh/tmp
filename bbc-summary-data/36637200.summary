Eight children and two adults were injured when the ride derailed at the M&D's park near Strathclyde Park, Motherwell, on Sunday.
Three of the children are in a serious condition. Another child has been released from hospital.
The park's owners said they were co-operating with a joint police and Heath and Safety Executive investigation.
A statement on the M&D's website said the theme park was "closed until further notice".
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed on Monday that it has four children at the Royal Hospital for Children. Three of them are in a serious condition, while one is described as stable.
One adult is in a stable condition at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, a health board spokesman confirmed.
NHS Lanarkshire said that five patients were taken to Wishaw General Hospital.
Of those, three children and one adult are said to be in a stable condition. One other minor has now been discharged, a spokesman confirmed.
Details of their injuries have not been released.
Witnesses said people were trapped upside down on the Tsunami ride when it crashed at 15:37 BST on Sunday.
The bright neon sign at the main front entrance to the M&D's theme park is still switched on and flickering away this morning but the park itself is anything but.
It is remaining closed as health and safety officials continue their investigations.
There is also a small police presence here at the site.
Katie Burns, who had just finished riding the rollercoaster, wrote on Facebook that she watched in disbelief as it derailed.
She said: "Honestly never been so scared in my life, with this weather they should not be on.
"Kids and adults are still on it upside down, it's like something out of a horror film, children crying and everything."
The park was evacuated as six ambulances and six fire engines attended the scene.
Ch Insp David Bruce said: "On arrival it became clear a series of five gondolas connected on a train on the Tsunami ride had detached from the rails, struck the superstructure and then struck the ground.
"They [the gondolas] fell less than 20 feet. It would appear that they had been coming round a bend and at that point it detached."
The ride travels at up to 40mph through corkscrew turns and loops but police could not confirm the speed it was moving at when it derailed.
A spokesman for the theme park's operators M&D's said: "As a family-run business, our thoughts are with those who have been injured and their families.
"We wish everyone a full recovery. We are co-operating fully with Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive on their joint investigation to ascertain the cause of the accident."
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Euan McLean, a sports journalist at the Daily Record who was waiting in a queue for the ride with his 9-year-old-daughter, said people rushed to help after the crash.
"We had already been on the ride three times and nothing was amiss at all. My daughter was excited about going back on it," he said.
"The yellow car went in to the first corner at high speed and didn't turn. It just went straight off the rollercoaster, flying through a barrier and on to the concrete below.
"It was a horrendous thing to see and a horrendous sound. Some people panicked. My first thought was to get my daughter out in order for her not to see any more, but there were many, many people who just ran straight to help and they obviously deserve huge praise."
Samuel, 14, who was at the park with his family and witnessed the crash, told BBC Scotland: "I could see one of the wheels was shaking so I started to walk away from it and then it was about to turn the corner and it started heavy shaking and everyone was screaming.
"It then just fell straight of the lines. It just crashed and all you could hear was a big bang."
It is not the first time the park has experienced problems with its rides, including Tsunami.
Nine passengers, including children, were stranded for eight hours on the ride in July 2011 when it came to a halt 60 ft (18.2m) above the ground. The malfunction was blamed on a broken lift chain.
In March, eight people had to be rescued by firefighters when the park's Tornado rollercoaster ground to a halt 20 ft (6m) in the air.
