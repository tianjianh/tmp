Television is Greece's medium of choice, followed by the press, the internet and radio.

News, variety programmes, comedy and game shows dominate peak-time TV. There are about a dozen private TV channels and a plethora of private radios.
The media have been badly hit by Greece's economic, social and political crisis. Facing declining circulation figures and advertising revenues, some outlets have imposed cuts or closed altogether.
In June 2013, the conservative-led government abruptly took state broadcaster ERT off the air and dismissed its 2,600 staff, citing endemic mismanagement. The move drew international criticism and sparked a domestic political crisis.
Some of the sacked staff occupied ERT's offices and continued to make internet broadcasts.
A replacement public broadcaster, New Hellenic Radio, Internet and TV (NERIT), made its debut in May 2014.
Media rights group Reporters Without Borders has alleged conflicts of interest in the senior management of some media outlets, saying wealthy owners and state officials have tried to consolidate and extend their power through the media.
The watchdog says journalists are often targeted by police when covering demonstrations and have received threats from the far right, the extreme left, and anarchists.
There were 5.7 million internet users by June 2012 (Internetworldstats). Seven in 10 internet users are on social media, with Facebook being the most popular platform.
