[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Belfast is set to welcome the Tall Ships festival for the third time from 2 July.

Around 500,000 people are expected to flock to the docks for the festivities before bidding goodbye to up to 50 vessels when they sail out of Belfast Lough on Sunday, 5 July.
Lord Mayor Arder Carson says it is set to be the biggest event ever held in the city.
But with major disruption and traffic congestion expected, visitors need to plan ahead.
Special transport and traffic arrangements will be in place to deal with the thousands of expected visitors.
Here's what you need to know.
Translink have published details online of special transport services being laid on for the event.
It includes details of free shuttle buses that will operate from the city centre to the two main sites for the festival - Queen's Quay at the Odyssey Complex, and Pollock Dock.
Shuttle bus times
Thursday and Friday (all times BST): 12:00-22:00
Saturday: 10:00-23:00
Sunday: 10:00-17:00
The buses depart every five minutes during operating hours.
There will also be a free shuttle to transport visitors between Pollack Dock and Queen's Quay.
For those travelling by car, two dedicated park and ride facilities will be available - one from Airport Road West to Queen's Quay, the other from Boucher Road Playing Fields to Pollock Dock.
The car parking charge is Â£2.50, with the shuttle bus provided for free.
Alternatively, Translink's park and ride services from Cairnshill, Dundonald, Sprucefield and Ballymartin will be open from 10:30 BST each day of the festival.
Parking is free and normal bus fares apply.
Several roads in the city centre and port areas will be closed or restricted for the duration of the four-day event.
Queen's Quay, Queen Elizabeth Bride, Corporation Square and Donegall Quay are all subject to restrictions - full details can be found on the Tall Ships Belfast website.
The police have also said that parking restrictions will be strictly enforced and concession for blue badge holders to park on single or double yellow lines in the Harbour Estate and event areas will not apply during the event.
Blue badge holders can reserve a parking space at Corporation Square or park on a first come, first served basis at the Odyssey Arena or one of the designated park and ride sites.
