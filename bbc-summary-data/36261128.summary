Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder Dave Edwards says competition for central midfield places in Wales' Euro 2016 squad is fierce.

Edwards, 30, has been included in Wales' 29-man pre-Euro 2016 training camp to be held in Portugal.
Manager Chris Coleman will name his final 23-man squad for the tournament on Tuesday, 31 May.
"I know it's going to be tough to get into the squad," Edwards told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
"I would probably say maybe four or five central midfielders are definitely in like Aaron Ramsey, Joe Ledley, Joe Allen and Andy King.
"But then you've obviously got me, Emyr Huws and David Vaughan.
"There's a lot of quality there and I just hope I can do enough personally.

"I played a bit of a part in the [qualifying] campaign and getting there so it will be real special getting in the squad. It's everyone's dream to play in a major tournament."
Shrewsbury-born Edwards has played 31 times for Wales, including five appearances during the Euro 2016 qualifiers.
Edwards was out for two months earlier in the season following surgery on a broken bone in his foot.
He missed Wales' friendlies against Northern Ireland and Ukraine in March but has played six times for Wolves since making his comeback in April.
"When I was injured my driving force was the carrot of being at the Euros," Edwards said.
"It was always my aim, when I was injured, to get back fit and playing. I did that and obviously this is the next step.
"I'm looking forward to going there and hopefully doing enough in the week in Portugal to get on that plane to France."
