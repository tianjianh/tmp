Ex-servicemen attempt marathon on every continent over seven days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former army captain is aiming to run a marathon on every continent in a week to raise funds for an armed forces rehabilitation centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ibrar Ali, from Selby, North Yorkshire, was injured by a road-side bomb in Iraq and lost his lower right arm, but re-trained and returned to active service.
He was part of the Walking with the Wounded trip which trekked to the South Pole with Prince Harry in 2013.
The seven-day challenge starts on 23 January in Antarctica.
Mr Ali, originally from Rotherham in South Yorkshire, is attempting the challenge alongside RAF veteran Luke Wigman, who he met while competing at the Invictus Games.
The challenge will involve 295km of running and 59 hours of flight time.
Marathon locations
Mr Ali, who has been awarded the Military Cross, said: "I'm certainly feeling like I can achieve it, but I'm incredibly nervous.
"I think this will be my most difficult challenge, just from the amount of travel involved and the wear and tear our bodies will go through."
Money raised through the challenge will help fund the Defence & National Rehabilitation Centre, which is being built near Loughborough and will open in 2018.
Mr Ali, who left the Army in 2013, said: "Even though it's their summer at the moment, the temperatures in Antarctica will still be from -20C to -30C.
"As we travel around the globe and finish in Sydney, the temperatures will be around 30C, so that's seven days with 60C degrees of temperature change."
