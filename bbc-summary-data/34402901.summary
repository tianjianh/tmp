Rare plants stolen from University of Oxford botanic gardens

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Oxford's botanic garden is asking visitors to help catch "well-prepared" thieves targeting rare plants.

The University of Oxford attraction in the city centre has suffered about 40 plant thefts over the last three years.
Most recently its only example of a rare carnivorous plant, roridula gorgonias, was stolen in spring from one of its greenhouses.
Curator Kate Pritchard said the plants may have been stolen "to order" and added: "It's hugely demoralising."
She said the thieves must have come prepared with cutting equipment, such as long knives, because otherwise some of the plants could only be reached using a ladder.
Among the other species taken were orchids and plants from the bromelia family, which took about five years to cultivate.
Ms Pritchard said: "Whoever took them knew what to look out for, they know their plants and came well-prepared.
"They were taking more unusual species, so they could have been taking them to order.
"It is a very selfish mentality. We ask our visitors to remain vigilant when exploring the garden, but not to approach anybody who they might think is behaving suspiciously."
Gardens curator for the University of Oxford Botanic Garden and Harcourt Arboretum Tom Price said a "culture change" was needed.
He said: "People are aware it's illegal to steal from museums, galleries, and libraries.
"But living collections such as the botanic garden and Harcourt arboretum don't seem to register on the same scale with the public."
The thefts were reported to Thames Valley Police and signs have been put up to alert visitors, he added.
