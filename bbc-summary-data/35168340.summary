[SN]TITLE[SN]
Consultation on Scottish pollinator strategy

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Views have been sought on a plan to reverse declines in numbers of bees and hoverflies in Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said the insects need greater protection because of their role pollinating crops, fruits and other plants.
Consultation on its plan, A Pollinator Strategy for Scotland 2016-2026, runs until March.
SNH said it aims to build on work that has already begun on creating flower-rich habitats and control diseases.
Scotland has 23 types of bumblebee, 79 solitary bees and the honey bee.
