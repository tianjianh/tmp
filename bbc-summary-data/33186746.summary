The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall were at St Paul's Cathedral in London on Thursday for the national service of commemoration marking the 200th anniversary of Waterloo.

During the formal procession into the cathedral, one of the youngest soldiers currently serving in an Irish regiment carried the Field Marshal's Baton of the Duke of Wellington, who was born in Ireland.
Ranger Joseph Nixon, 19, was representing the Royal Irish Regiment, the successors of the 27th Inniskilling Regiment of Foot, which fought at Waterloo.
"This is a real privilege for me and a great chance to represent the modern regiment whilst remembering those whose heritage we share" said the young Ballymena soldier.
It is estimated that about 9,000 Irishmen fought with the Duke of Wellington's army.
Most of them were in locally raised regiments such as the 27th Inniskillings and the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards and the 18th Kings Irish Hussars.
These were men from all over Ireland, many of them weavers and farm labourers who found themselves out of work due the increasing mechanisation of industry.
Among them was James Graham from Clones who after "a day of unrelenting slaughter" on the field of conflict, was declared "the bravest man at Waterloo" by Wellington.
On a wall in St Tiernach's Church of Ireland in Clones hang two plaques in memory of Sgt Graham, establishing a direct link between the church and the battle in Belgium.
Local historian George Knight said the Clones man was involved in a pivotal moment in the battle.
"Anyone who has read about the Waterloo realises that the battle pretty much hung on the defence of Hougoumont," he said.
"If it had fallen, the chances are that Waterloo would have been lost. The French troops broke into Hougoumont farm at one stage and Sgt Graham and his commanding officer were responsible for closing the gateway that they'd broken through."
To this day James Graham's story is not that well-known, but that could be about to change according to the Rector of St Tiernach's, Archdeacon Helene Steed.
"To have two plaques in our church remembering the man regarded as the bravest man in England and Ireland at that time is something to be proud of and be inspired by," she said.

"To have people like that who are brave and are prepared to do things."
George Knight said interest is peaking now because of the bi-centenary.
"There's a bit of interest now, but really he's been a forgotten hero. I can just imagine if Clones, instead of being an Irish town, was a little English village, there would be a large bronze statue of Sgt Graham in the village square.
The Innisksillings Museum has the largest single collection of Waterloo medals along with other artefacts from the battle.
Curator Neil Armstrong said the bonds with the battle in Belgium were strong.
"Both Inniskilling regiments were at Waterloo and lost hundreds of men, killed wounded and missing," he said.
"Napoleon and Wellington are both quoted as commenting on fighting spirit of the Irish regiments.
"They played a major role in this epic turning point in world history. These were Irish men literally from every county in Ireland."
The slaughter in the mud at Waterloo cost thousands of lives. It is estimated that up to 2,000 Irish soldiers were among the dead and wounded.
Military commanders acknowledged that it was a close run thing.
In the end Wellington triumphed over Napoleon and the course of history was set.
Today is about remembering all those who fought and died in one of the most famous military engagements in history.
