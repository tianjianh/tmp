He said: "I have been at EastEnders for nine years and I feel the time is right to give Max a break".
But he added: "It won't be for too long as I shall be back next year to see Max face another chapter of drama."
Last year, the 42-year-old reached the semi-final of Strictly Come Dancing under the tutelage of his professional partner Janette Manrara.
EastEnders' executive producer, Dominic Treadwell-Collins, said: "Both Jake and I agreed that Max has been through so much over the past nine years that we would give both him and Jake a break when the opportunity arose.
"That opportunity has come and it is the perfect time to send Max Branning out with a bang that will send ripples through the Square for the rest of the year until Jake returns."
There has been no word yet on how Max will depart the soap.
Prior to EastEnders, Wood starred in shows including Only Fools and Horses, London's Burning and Red Dwarf.
