Stokes smashed 158 from 131 balls and Taylor compiled a stylish 114 before both were retired out.
Nick Compton, batting at three, marked his return with 58.
That helped England recover from 56-3 as Alastair Cook managed only two and new opening partner Alex Hales eight.
Hales is set to become the eighth man tried at the top of the order since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012 when the first of four Tests against South Africa begins on 26 December.
In this first of two warm-up matches, the Nottinghamshire man faced nine balls, one of which was an edge through the slips, before the 10th took his off stump as he offered no stroke to Junior Dala.
Cook had already been trapped lbw Thandolwethu Mnyaka and, after Joe Root edged behind for a 28 scored exclusively in boundaries, the tourists were wobbling.
Enter Compton, given the chance at number three ahead of Gary Ballance, to play with the sort of control England require after the omission of Ian Bell.
He was eventually pinned lbw on the back foot, allowing Taylor and Stokes to push the innings into a higher gear.
Stokes, in particular, dished out some brutal treatment, going from 50 to 100 in only 38 balls. In all he struck 23 fours and five sixes, the last of which left the fielding side unable to find the ball.
When both men were called to the pavilion, Jonny Bairstow (35) and Moeen Ali (33 not out) were afforded some time at the crease.
