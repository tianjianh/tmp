The Jorvik Viking Centre in York has launched a campaign to raise £2m to help it re-open.
Its underground re-creation of a Viking street was ruined in December but original 9th Century items, including a sock, bowls and tools were rescued
The York Archaeological Trust plans to open a revamped museum, which attracts 400,000 visitors a year, next February.
The museum closed on the 27 December when water from the flooded River Foss resulted in up to 3 ft (1 m) of water in some parts of the museum.
The city's Norse history was revealed in the 1970s when an archaeological dig at Coppergate found Viking streets buried below the modern pavement.
The trust, an independent charity, opened the centre in 1984.
David Jennings, chief executive, said: "Whilst we could simply replicate the pre-flood displays, our mission to educate in an accessible way drives us to plan how we can do it even better than before - and to do this, we will need to raise a significant sum of money."
The Jorvik centre said it was to stage a temporary exhibition at other York venues including the Theatre Royal.
A planned touring exhibition to other UK venues is to continue despite the flooding.
