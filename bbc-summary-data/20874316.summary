Guernsey prison begins ban on smoking and tobacco

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A smoking ban has begun at Guernsey's Les Nicolles prison.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All tobacco products have been banned at the facility, making Guernsey the second European jurisdiction to ban smoking anywhere on prison grounds.
The island has followed the Isle of Man's lead in implementing the move, which allows prisoners electronic cigarettes as a tobacco substitute.
The smoking ban, which aims to curb the effects of passive smoking, was backed by Guernsey's Home Department.
Deputy Francis Quin, the Deputy Home Minister, said: "People used to smoke in offices... that's all changed.
"It's a changed world, you've got to live with it."
Louise Arkle, deputy governor of Les Nicolles prison, said: "To introduce a partial ban, where they could smoke in the outside areas... would be so difficult to police."
She added: "Therefore we have a 15m boundary on the external of the fence, and then it's completely no smoking internally."
