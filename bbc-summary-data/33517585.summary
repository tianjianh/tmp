The rebels stopped the bus carrying security personnel in Bijapur district.
The Maoists say they are fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor.
Their insurgency began in the eastern state of West Bengal in the late 1960s, spreading to more than one-third of India's 600-plus  districts.
"Four police personnel were kidnapped on Monday evening by Maoists," Chhattisgarh police chief Amarnath Upadhyaya told AFP news agency.
"A group of Maoists intercepted the passenger bus and kidnapped them near Kutru (village)," he added.
Kutru is a rebel dominated area, some 525km (326 miles) south of the state capital, Raipur.
Chhattisgarh is often hit by Maoist violence. At least 14 policemen were killed in an ambush in the state in December.
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described India's Maoist insurgency as its "greatest internal security challenge".
