Michael Smith, 27, of Burton-on-the-Wolds, Leicestershire, died suddenly of brain cancer two months ago.
An e-petition calling for more research has reached the target of 100,000 signatures.
It said only 1.5% of cancer research funding was allocated to brain cancer.
The e-petition was started by Maria Lester with the support of Brain Tumour Research and was supported by the Leicester Tigers Rugby Club.
Brain tumours kill more children and adults under 40 than any other cancer, according to figures from Brain Tumour Research.
Michael's mother, Eileen, said: "If there [had been] more research available for his condition... we might not be here today talking about Michael."
His father, Terry, said: "Michael would be so proudâ€¦ that his story is being used in such a positive way - I think he would be absolutely thrilled."
The Department of Health said the government, charities and industry were working together to turn research into vital treatments for brain tumour patients.
It also said that brain tumour research "received... a greater proportion (of funding) than for 40 of the 49 site-specific categories".
