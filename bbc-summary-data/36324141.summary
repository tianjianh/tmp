Hampshire: Sean Ervine named limited-overs captain in James Vince's absence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sean Ervine has been named Hampshire's limited-overs captain in the absence of James Vince, who is on international duty with England.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Uncapped batsman Vince was called up to England's Test squad last week.
All-rounder Ervine, 33, has made more than 400 appearances for Hants since arriving from Zimbabwe in 2005.
"It feels great to be captain," said Ervine. "Whilst we're disappointed Vince can't be with us, it's brilliant he's been selected for England."
Ervine's first competitive match as Hampshire skipper will be the trip to Uxbridge for the T20 Blast fixture against Middlesex on 27 May.
