Rebecca Minnock went on the run from her home in Highbridge, Somerset, with her son Ethan for 17 days after a court ruled he should live with his father.
The 35-year-old was in the Oxford area when she made contact with Avon and Somerset Police on Friday.
Police said no arrests had been made following the boy's return.
Ethan's father, Roger Williams said: "Ethan is safely back in my care now."
Police said both Ms Minnock and Ethan were found "safe and well" and would now receive "the support they need".
"This will be a matter for the family courts now," the spokesman added.
Judge Stephen Wildblood QC, the High Court judge dealing with the case, confirmed there would be a hearing at Bristol Crown Court on Monday.
Speaking to the Daily Mail before she handed herself in, Ms Minnock said she hoped the decision about her son would now be reconsidered.
She told the paper: "I feel that my time has run out now. My only regret would be the trouble that my family have gotten into, all the police efforts and time I've wasted."
Ms Minnock said her son believed he had been on holiday because they had been having "normal, fun times together", such as going swimming and visiting parks.
She said she decided to come out of hiding after Ethan asked to see family members.
Nicholas Cusworth QC, a family law barrister, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Ms Minnock's decision to breach the court order would be taken into "very serious consideration" in future legal proceedings.
"The court will have to decide how to take forward the relationship he has with both his parents," he said.
"In circumstances where the court makes an order designed to protect the best interest of a child, for one of that child's parents to undermine that court order deliberately... inevitably will mean the well of trust the court has towards her is going to be at a low ebb at the moment.
"It'll be up to her to demonstrate that she can be trusted in future."
Ms Minnock has been engaged in a two-year legal battle with Mr Williams over contact with their son.
In February, a district judge found she had fabricated allegations against him in order to "frustrate contact" with his son.
A social worker reported that Ethan was not "emotionally safe" with his mother, and Ethan had been staying with his father four nights a week since February.
Earlier on Friday, Ethan's grandmother was sentenced to 10 days in prison for lying in court about the pair's disappearance.
Louise Minnock, 52, was convicted of contempt of court for hiding the fact they were driven to Cheltenham by her partner Andrew Butt, who was jailed for 28 days for contempt.
