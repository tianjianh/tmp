The woman was coming down the escalator at Asda supermarket in Warren Street, Stockport, Greater Manchester on Friday evening.
She fell forward and suffered a number of injuries, including cuts to her forehead which needed 15 stitches.
Det Sgt Geoff Machent said it "may have been a prank that has gone wrong".
He said: "We believe two women in their late teens were seen near to the emergency stop button at the time it was stopped and I would ask them to come forward."
Police said the woman, who also suffered cuts and bruises to both legs, was due to undergo surgery.
"She, along with her family, is hoping she will be at home for Christmas," Det Sgt Machent said.
An Asda spokeswoman said: "We are working very closely with police on this tragic incident that happened at the Stockport store."
