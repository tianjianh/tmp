The film, which features blind amateur actors as massage therapists, won best feature film, best cinematography and best sound effects.
Zhang Lei won best new performer, while the film also picked up the honours for best adapted screenplay and editing.
The film centres on the lives of the workers at a massage parlour in Nanjing.
The Golden Horse awards are considered to be the Chinese-language equivalent of the Oscars.
Chinese actor and director Chen Jianbin was also a big winner on the night - the 40-year old won best new director and best lead actor for A Fool, a film about a Chinese farmer who takes in a homeless man.
He also picked up best supporting actor for his role in Taiwanese military drama Paradise in Service.
Ann Hui won her third Golden Horse for best director for Golden Era, based on the life of Chinese writer Xiao Hong.
Chen Shiang-Chyi won the coveted best actress award for Exit.
"I feel like I have made it, to be able to win this award for Taiwan. I love Taiwan films and I dedicated this for Taiwan,'' said Chen in her acceptance speech.
But Black Coal, Thin Ice, a detective thriller that won Berlin's prestigious Golden Bear prize earlier this year, could only manage one win for art direction. It was nominated in eight categories.
