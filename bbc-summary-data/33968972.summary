[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast salons fined after 15-year-old girl uses sunbeds

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three Belfast tanning salons have been fined £250 each after they let a 15-year-old girl use their sunbeds.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fines followed an exercise by Belfast City Council who tested 10 premises last week.
Fixed penalty notices were issued to three salons, each of which incurred a fine of £250.
It is against the law to allow a person under 18 to use a sunbed in salons.
