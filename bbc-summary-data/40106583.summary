Police believe Luke Campbell-Tapson may have taken MDMA at a "youth disco" at Vivid nightclub in Ilfracombe.
He was taken to North Devon District Hospital where he died in the early hours of Saturday.
His family said Luke, from South Molton, had "paid a price completely out of proportion".
They added: "He was only 16 years old, bursting with promise, with a rich and full life in front of him.
"The support and love of his community has been a great comfort to us, but there is now a large Luke-shaped hole in our lives, where a funny, engaging, chaotic, shiny presence used to be.
"He was dancing in a thunderstorm the night he died. In our hearts he will be dancing in the thunderstorm forever."
More on the investigation and other Devon and Cornwall news.
Devon and Cornwall Police has launched an investigation into the teenager's death.
Supt Toby Davies said one of the lines of inquiry "relates to the possible consumption of a controlled substance, believed to be MDMA tablets".
Two young adults were also admitted to Derriford Hopsital in Plymouth on the same night after taking taking "recreational drugs", believed to be MDMA tablets, at a house party.
Both remain in hospital, and one is in a "serious condition", police said.
Officers would not say if the two incidents are linked, or comment if there is a particular "tainted batch" of the drug in circulation.
