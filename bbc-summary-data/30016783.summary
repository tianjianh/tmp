The band of rain which fell on Tuesday cleared by Wednesday morning but more bad weather is set to move in.
Natural Resources Wales has four flood alerts in place for Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.
The Met Office has issued yellow "be aware" warnings for strong winds in the same area on Thursday and for heavy rain across south and mid Wales.
It warned travel could be disrupted and trees damaged.
Tuesday's rain was the second time in a week that Pembrokeshire has suffered flooding.
Roads and properties in Milford Haven and Pembroke Dock as well as Neyland and Haverfordwest were affected.
Mid and West Fire Service said it also took calls from parts of Carmarthenshire.
South west Wales was badly hit by storms over the weekend, with several flooding incidents in Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion following a yellow warning for the south Wales coast.
The yellow warnings are currently in place up to Friday.
