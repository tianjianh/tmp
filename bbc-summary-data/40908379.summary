[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bromley 2-0 Hartlepool United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bromley built on their exciting unbeaten start to the season with a win at home to struggling Hartlepool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There was little to choose between the teams in the first half, but the Ravens led when Louis Dennis squared and Josh Rees side-footed his side in front from close range.
The same combination should have put Neil Smith's men two up early in the second half, but this time Rees blazed over from six yards.
Bromley did extend their lead on the hour though, when Luke Wanadio tried his luck from the edge of the area and it flew past Scott Loach.
Wanadio also hit the post as the hosts saw out the match comfortably.
