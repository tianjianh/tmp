The Conservative MP for Bath, Ben Howlett, has been questioned by police over an alleged sex assault.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Sun newspaper reported he voluntarily attended a police station to speak to detectives after a complaint was made.
The alleged attack is said to have taken place at a Eurovision results party in his constituency in May.
Mr Howlett, 30, has not been arrested, and said he "strenuously denied any wrongdoing".
He said: "The Sun newspaper and others have published stories concerning allegations about me today.
"My legal team is closely looking into this.  I strenuously deny any wrongdoing.  I will be making no further comment on this matter."
Avon and Somerset Constabulary said Mr Howlett had not been arrested and inquiries were continuing.
A Conservative Party spokesman said it would be "inappropriate to comment" while a police investigation was ongoing.
