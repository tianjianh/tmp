A man stabbed to death near a London Tube station could have been the victim of a random attack, the Met has said.

University lecturer Daniel Young, 30, was killed in Kendor Gardens, near Morden, at about 08:07 GMT on Tuesday.
Detectives said they had "not ruled out" an attack by a stranger and are investigating whether it is linked to an earlier stabbing that morning.
A 26-year-old man, arrested on suspicion of murder, has been bailed.
Police said the first attack was on a 23-year-old man in Lewis Road, Mitcham at about 07:30 GMT.
The victim was taken to hospital after he was stabbed in the buttocks.
Det Supt Paul Monk said it was "possible that these are two separate attacks but equally they might be the same person".
"Random stranger attacks, murders, in London are extremely rare," he said, but added: "I can't preclude that this isn't such an attack."
Officers were called to Kendor Gardens - a park used by commuters as a short cut to Morden Tube station and Morden Road tram stop - where Mr Young had been stabbed.
He died at the scene.
Mr Young, originally from Paignton in Devon, was on his way to the second day of his new job as a lecturer at Coventry University's London Campus International.
Earlier, Det Ch Insp Cliff Lyons said: "This appears to be unprovoked attack on a man that was simply going about his daily business... and there would have been a number of commuters in the vicinity.
"I believe that the suspect would have entered and exited Kendor Gardens via Dorset Road and Kenley Road. From which direction they entered and exited has yet to be established."
Det Supt Paul Monk said the bailed man was still "very much part of the investigation" but appealed for witnesses who may have seen either attack.
