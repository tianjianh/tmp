Huddersfield Town 1-0 Derby County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Elias Kachunga's injury-time winner rewarded Huddersfield Town's persistence and ended Derby County's four-game unbeaten run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steve McClaren had overseen a win and a draw since returning as head coach, but his side were second best against Town.
The hosts dominated the second period, with Derby managing just two shots on target throughout the match.
And Kachunga headed in substitute Harry Bunn's fine 93rd-minute cross to take Town to third in the Championship.
Matej Vydra wasted two good first opportunities for the visitors in the first half, shooting over from a Will Hughes pass and mis-timing a header.
But the Terriers upped the tempo thereafter and Nakhi Wells, Bunn, Chris Lowe and Kasey Palmer all went close before Kachunga's winner.
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:
"I am angry that after two defeats I have to answer questions about the character of my players.
"At Huddersfield we are humble; we know where we come from. Eleven months ago I came here and I lost my first two games and we were in a relegation battle.
"Now we under-perform in one game against Preston and people question us. I am angry when I read that we need a new striker. That is not correct."
"We are Huddersfield Town and we are a long-term project. We have won nine from 14 and we have under-performed once."
Derby head coach Steve McClaren:
"It's a cruel way to end the game. The players and the supporters don't deserve that and I thought our performance merited at least a point.
"It is about playing for 95 minutes and we didn't do that. We had dealt with everything during the game but perhaps we switched off at the end and it's cost us. They took a risk and got the result.
"There's a lot of issues, more than I thought there was going to be. We have some work to do on the training ground but we have to take heart and know we can compete in the Championship.
