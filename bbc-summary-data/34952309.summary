Jimmy Ball put the visitors ahead before the break with a left-foot volley following a corner.
Richard Bennett nodded a second, but Northampton replied when Nicky Adams' shot deflected in off Sam Hoskins.
Adams was again the provider as Jason Taylor headed them level and Dominic Calvert-Lewin nodded the winner.
The game was partly overshadowed by a fire at a pub near the stadium which started shortly before the game and continued to burn throughout.
But there was no interruption to the action on the pitch, with both sides looking to reach round three for the first time since the 2005-06 season.
After an early Calvert-Lewin effort was saved by Mason Springthorpe, who also kept out Ryan Cresswell's header, the home side showed little of the quality that had brought them five successive wins to carry them to third place in League Two.
And their failure to clear a corner cost them dear as midfielder Ball found the bottom corner for Northwich.
Zander Diamond almost equalised when his header was blocked near the line, but Bennett flicked his 15th goal of the season for the Northern Premier League visitors, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, after Brian Summerskill caught David Buchanan in possession and his deft chip came back off the bar.
Cobblers boss Chris Wilder used all three substitutes and one of them, striker Marc Richards, forced a superb save from Springthorpe, diving low to his left.
A huge slice of luck brought their first goal, however, with Hoskins diverting the ball into the corner and Taylor and Calvert-Lewin found the net in a hectic finish to put the Cobblers into the hat for Monday's third-round draw.
