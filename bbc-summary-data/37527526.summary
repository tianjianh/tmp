[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The match ignited with three late first-half goals, the first coming in the 35th minute as Jack Parkinson curled in superbly off the post for the visitors from Mitch Pinnock's corner.
Gateshead broke away to equalise straight from kick-off when Wes York was on hand to tap in after Jones' point-blank shot was saved.
Jones then collected Paddy McLaughlin's cross superbly to put the hosts in front in the 44th minute.
McLaughlin made it 3-1 three minutes into the second half, but Ricky Miller halved the deficit after 57 minutes with his 10th goal of the season.
Sam Jones fired his second past Mitch Walker two minutes later to restore the two-goal lead but missed out on a hat-trick when he hit the crossbar with a penalty.
