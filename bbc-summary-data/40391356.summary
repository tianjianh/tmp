This lady from Thailand has been making the special poo-shaped puddings in her kitchen.
They are made from coconut milk, gelatin and food colouring and are a popular sweet treat in Thailand.
Wilaiwan Mee-Nguen makes the cakes at the weekend for fun, and started making poo shaped cakes after one of her customers asked for an unusual shape.
Now, the poo puddings are her most popular cake, and she sells around 1,000 of them a month!
That's a lot of poo!
