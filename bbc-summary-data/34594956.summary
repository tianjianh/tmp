Leading surgeons say the surgery not only drastically reduces a person's weight, but it can have a side-effect on the gut, which causes dangerous sugar levels to return to normal.

Speaking to Adrian Goldberg for Radio 4's The Report, Jenni Murray says we need to stop moralising about weight-loss surgery, and that a salad and exercise approach to treating obesity does not work for everyone.
