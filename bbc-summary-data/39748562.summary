The 31-year-old back-row forward arrived at Sixways last summer and has scored two tries in 15 appearances.
"Foti possesses huge power and the ability to break the gain-line so he is a fantastic player to have in our squad," Warriors boss Gary Gold said.
Faosiliva added: "We are building a very good squad at Warriors and I am excited about the future."
Faosiliva was part of the Samoa side which won the IRB Sevens World Series in 2009-10 and then had a spell at Toulon before spending three seasons with Bath.
He has won 21 caps for Samoa and made two appearances for his country at the 2015 Rugby World Cup.
