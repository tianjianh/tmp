[SN]TITLE[SN]
Centenary of Battle of the Somme marked in Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Commemorations are being held to mark 100 years since the start of one of the bloodiest battles in history.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than one million men were wounded or killed in the Battle of the Somme during World War One.
An overnight vigil was held at Scotland's National War Memorial in Edinburgh.
A whistle, which was sounded to lead men over the top, was blown by a Scots soldier to mark, to the minute, 100 years since the battle began.
Alan Hamilton blew a whistle used by his great uncle at 07:30 on Friday.
Service personnel and veterans groups were among those keeping a silent vigil throughout the night.
It is one of a series of similar events planned across the UK.
The Queen and Prince Philip will join the congregation at Westminster Abbey in London for an evening vigil.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will attend evening events at the Thiepval Memorial in France, where 70,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers with no known grave are commemorated.
A two-minute silence was held on Friday morning.
The Somme offensive followed a week-long bombardment of enemy defences designed to allow allied troops to walk through the German lines.
The reality was very different, with 57,470 British soldiers killed or injured in the first day alone.
It lasted 141 days and hardly a family in Scotland was unaffected by the carnage.
