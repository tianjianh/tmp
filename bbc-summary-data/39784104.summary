[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alastair Cook & Haseeb Hameed available for counties until July

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Test openers Alastair Cook and Haseeb Hameed can play all of their counties' fixtures before July's first Test against South Africa, the England and Wales Cricket Board has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Essex's Cook, 32, and Lancashire's Hameed, 20, along with Durham's Keaton Jennings, are available for every One-Day Cup and County Championship match.
Pacemen James Anderson and Stuart Broad can feature in the majority of games.
England Test captain Joe Root can play three One-Day Cup matches.
Several members of England's Test side will be away with the one-day team for the Champions Trophy which runs from 1-18 June.
Yorkshire's Root is available for only one four-day game before the South Africa series, as the ECB has allowed all of England's Test squad to take part in the first ever day-night round of County Championship fixtures, starting on 26 June.
It is hoped it will give the players more experience of the pink balls that will be used for England's inaugural day-night Test against West Indies at Edgbaston in August.
Andrew Strauss, director of England cricket, said: "This was always going to be a difficult summer in terms of managing the workload on our England players, with such a hectic schedule including the Champions Trophy as well as seven Tests, followed by an equally busy winter in Australia and New Zealand.
"We appreciate all of this causes disruption for counties and frustration for their supporters, and we are grateful to them for seeing the big picture in appreciating the need for us to ensure that key players remain in the best possible condition for the challenges ahead."
