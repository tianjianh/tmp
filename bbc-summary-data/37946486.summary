[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]

Nathan Baker met an Albert Adomah free-kick with a fine flicked header to put Villa in front after 20 minutes.
Murray responded by fizzing a low shot past goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini just before the break.
Jonathan Kodjia hit the bar and David Stockdale made two crucial saves as Villa pressed for a second-half winner.
While Villa were denied all three points at the Amex Stadium they remain unbeaten in six games since Steve Bruce took charge in October.
Baker's goal came with the first shot on target and against the run of play as second-placed Brighton started brightly, controlling more than 70% of the ball early on.
While the hosts would go on to dominate the possession stakes until Villa's second-half flurry, it was on the counter-attack that the Seagulls struck, Murray producing a sublime finish to level.
Jack Grealish came off the bench to give Villa renewed energy after the hour mark, Jordan Ayew's introduction after replacing Gabriel Agbonlahor also giving Bruce's side impetus.
However, Stockdale was equal to Kodjia's mistimed header and a low Adomah shot, while Ivory Coast international Kodjia also hit the bar with a header from close range.
After the match, Brighton manager Chris Hughton confirmed that his assistant Colin Calderwood will be taking a similar role at Villa Park.

Brighton manager Chris Hughton: "The game might have been different had we scored first, but it was a fair result.
"It was a bit of a sloppy goal to give away, but we showed good character to get back into the game.
"Villa are a very good side, with a structured 4-3-3 set up, and in the end it was a decent result."
Aston Villa manager Steve Bruce: "I'm delighted with the performance and I'm a tad disappointed that we didn't see it through in terms of the second-half display.
"It was easily the best performance we've produced and it was more like it.
"The players have been much maligned but they showed exactly what they're capable of. But we can't get carried away with ourselves just because we've had a good six weeks. We have a lot of work to do."
