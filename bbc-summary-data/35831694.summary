Doctor Waney Squier: Expert's fitness to practice impaired

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor who gave evidence in "shaken baby" cases has had her fitness to practice impaired, a panel has found.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) ruled Dr Waney Squier misled courts and gave irresponsible evidence in cases where parents were accused of killing their children.
Dr Squier, 67, based at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital, disputed the existence of "shaken baby syndrome".
Next week it will decide whether she can continue to practice.

The MPTS considered her work as an expert witness in six cases, including the deaths of four babies and a 19-month-old child.
In each case, Dr Squier, a paediatric neuropathologist, gave evidence that the injuries were not consistent with non-accidental injury, or were more likely to have been caused by other means.
In its ruling the MPTS said she had provided "deliberately misleading and dishonest evidence" and so her integrity "cannot be relied upon".
It added: "The tribunal has determined that your fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of your misconduct."
