George Gilmore, who was 44, was shot in the neck while he was in his car in Carrickfergus on Monday afternoon.
He died in hospital on Tuesday and police described his killing as a "ruthless attack in broad daylight".
The two men, aged 28 and 35, will appear in court in Belfast on Saturday morning on several charges.
As well as the murder charge they will each face, the men are also accused of two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.
