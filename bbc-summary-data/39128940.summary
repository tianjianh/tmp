Ed Sheeran is putting up signs asking motorists to drive safely, after one of his lyrics prompted a safety warning from police.

The singer, who lives near Framlingham in Suffolk, was pulled up by a roads sergeant on Twitter after singing about "driving at 90" in Castle on the Hill.
Sheeran said the blue signs, saying "drive safe", would be placed around parts of his home county.
He said: "I'm not encouraging speeding at all, I'm just singing it in a song."

Castle on the Hill, described as a "love song for Suffolk", was released in January and has remained towards the top of the chart since - being kept off the top spot by his other release, Shape of You.
Sgt Chris Harris, from Norfolk and Suffolk Roads Policing, posted a plea on Twitter for people to "slow down on Suffolk roads" in response to the line "driving at 90 down those country lanes".
"I don't think it specifically says miles per hour," Sheeran told the BBC. "It could be kilometres per hour."
The singer's decision to erect the signs coincides with the release of his third album, Ã·.
"We have a marketing spend for this album and I wanted to do some sort of billboards in Suffolk," Sheeran said. "We thought it would be quite funny instead of having billboards saying the album is out, just having a blue sign that says 'drive safe'."
The singer also said he was not too disappointed that Castle on the Hill failed to swap places with Shape of You in the chart, as he hoped it eventually would.
"For me it's all about the live show, having songs that react well, and having a song that's been in the top five for eight weeks will definitely go down well at a live show," he said.
