The Cameroon international, 29, was recently offered a new deal by Albion, along with Steve Sidwell and keepers David Stockdale and Niki Maenpaa.
The current contracts of all four players are due to expire this summer.
"We are delighted that Gaetan has agreed his new deal as he has been a key member of the squad," manager Chris Hughton told the club website.
Bong made 24 appearances last season, returning to action in April after three months out with a knee injury.
He joined Brighton in 2015 after a short spell at Wigan, having previously played for Metz, Valenciennes and Olympiakos.
"He played a big part in our success and I am looking forward to working with Gaetan again next season, as we look to establish ourselves in the Premier League," Hughton added.
