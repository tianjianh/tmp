[SN]TITLE[SN]
St Johnstone 2-0 Stenhousemuir

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
St Johnstone eased past League One Stenhousemuir in the fourth round of the Scottish Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Steven MacLean headed home Chris Millar's cross to put Saints in control.
And a deflected shot by Blair Alston doubled the Premiership side's advantage before the break.
Graham Cummins, David Wotherspoon, Alston and Chris Kane had further efforts for the hosts in the second period.
Stenny had overcome Forres Mechanics in a replay in round three but any hopes they had of causing a cup upset had all but ended within 32 minutes at McDiarmid Park.

Millar's pinpoint cross found MacLean, who had ghosted away from his marker to nod in from six yards.
Danny Swanson came close to a second before MacLean's back-heel teed up Alston to score.
Cummins should have added a third in the 70th minute when he scooped Alston's low cross wide.
Wotherspoon's 20-yard drive was deflected out and Alston's stoppage-time volley suffered the same fate.
Cummins' replacement Kane got his effort on target only to see it booted off the line.
