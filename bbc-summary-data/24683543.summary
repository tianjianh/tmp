[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Soldiers who specialise in construction work have marched through Grantham to mark their regiment being officially disbanded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The disbandment of the 168 Pioneer Regiment was announced in July as part of Army restructuring.
Formed in 1995, the regiment includes soldiers skilled in areas such as bricklaying and carpentry.
Their support to regular soldiers has included building training villages in Cyprus, and prisoner of war facilities.
The regiment, part of the Royal Logistic Corps, has also built things for communities in Lincolnshire and the North East, such as memorials, skate parks and a series of hides for bird watching.
Commanding officer Lt Col Andrew Parry said: "The Army Reserve needed to be shaped to meet future challenges.
"Our soldiers realise that and I know will serve their future units with the same commitment they have given to 168 Pioneer Regiment, a commitment that has made me proud to be their commanding officer."
The regimental headquarters are at the Prince William of Gloucester Barracks in Grantham, Lincolnshire.
Col Parry added: "Whilst this parade marks the end of an era it is also a time to celebrate the history and service of the regiment."
