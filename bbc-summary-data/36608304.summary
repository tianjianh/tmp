Tootle made 18 appearances for Town last season, but his last game was a 2-0 defeat by Port Vale on 31 October.
The 25-year-old joined the Shropshire side in June 2015, having previously played 224 times for Crewe, where he mostly featured as a right-back.
"I'm delighted to get it over the line," he told the Magpies website.
"It's a big club and from what I can see, everything that's happening at the club says it's going to be successful next season."
Earlier, Shrewsbury released a statement thanking Tootle in for "his hard work and dedication".
The Liverpudlian was one of Town boss Micky Mellon's close-season signings following promotion from League Two last summer.
He was tipped two summers ago to make a move higher up the leagues, has now been linked with a move to Scotland.
Town manager Micky Mellon has so far made seven summer signings as he attempts to rebuild following their League One relegation near-miss.
He released eight players, strikers Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro and Scott Vernon, defenders Jermaine Grandison, Zak Whitbread and Mickey Demetriou, midfielder Jordan Clark and wingers Elliot Grandin and James Caton.
