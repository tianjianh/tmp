The 27-year-old suffered the injury in the first half of his side's German Cup final win over Eintracht Frankfurt.
"In the coming days, there will be further tests and a decision will be made on the necessary treatment," said a Dortmund statement.
The club added they could not make a "precise prediction" about how long the German international will be out.
Reus, who turns 28 on Wednesday, won the first trophy of his career after Dortmund beat Eintracht 2-1 on Saturday.
However, the injury he suffered in the match comes as the latest in a list of setbacks for a player who was ruled out of the 2014 World Cup, which Germany won, after tearing ankle ligaments.
He was also left out of Euro 2016 because of injury concerns manager Joachim Low had about him.
Reus, who can play in midfield, as a winger or as a forward, has also been out with heel and hamstring issues this season.
