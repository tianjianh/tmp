[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Torquay United player-manger Kevin Nicholson says he understands why on-loan winger David Fitzpatrick is keen to return to parent club AFC Wimbledon.

The 21-year-old will go back to the League One side after the Gulls' match against Macclesfield on 11 January.
"It's just the legalities of it really, if you do short term loans you can only do 93 days," Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"He wants to go back and show Neal Ardley [AFC Wimbledon boss] he's worth a shot in their team."
Nicholson continued: "He's in his last year at Wimbledon so if he signed on here for the rest of the season, which we were pushing for, he was worried he might be out of sight out of mind."
Torquay are 17th in the National League and already short of players, with Aarran Racine injured, Paul Rooney's loan also coming to an end and Shaun Harrad missing for personal reasons.
"You've got people like Jamie Reid who can play that (Fitzpatrick's) position, where it's not really a winger, it's more of an attacker," Nicholson added.
"We're a very small squad, even with everybody available, but we'll work on that and see what we've got for Saturday."
