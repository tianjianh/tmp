The 37-year-old, who retired from the first-class game in 2015, steps up from a role with the second XI and academy.
Director of cricket Mick Newell said: "Paul has been taking steps into coaching for a number of years.
"Not only is Paul an impressive young coach, he's also part of the fabric of the club having achieved so much during his time as a player."
Franks, who made a single one-day international appearance for England, was previously in a captaincy and coaching role.
He won the Second XI Championship in 2015 and had a spell coaching with the United Arab Emirates.
Franks spent all his playing career at Notts and will work alongside new head coach Peter Moores in day-to-day charge of the first team.
"Peter has worked with lots of coaches in both county and international cricket - and he's very been very impressed with what he's seen from Paul," added Newell.
"Having played alongside our senior players, and been hugely involved in the development of the younger generation, he's well placed to get the best out of that group of players."
