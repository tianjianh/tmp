Bournemouth's 1-0 victory over Chelsea is "the biggest result in the club's history", according to boss Eddie Howe.

Glenn Murray's 82nd-minute header saw the Cherries become the first newly-promoted side to win at Stamford Bridge since Charlton in April 2001.
"The club has never been in the Premier League so winning at the champions is a huge result for the club," said Howe.
"Hopefully it will be talked about for a long time to come but we don't want this to be a one-off game."
The victory was Bournemouth's first since beating Sunderland in mid-September, and moves the south coast club one point clear of the relegation places.
Now Howe is determined to build on that, starting with next Saturday's visit of Manchester United.
"Hopefully there are more moments like that ahead of us," he said. "That's what we're hoping for this season; using this as a springboard to produce more magic days.
"We've had quite a few set backs and disappointments and that's why the players deserve all the credit for this moment.
"It's a reward for all their hard work and dedication but we have more work to do."
