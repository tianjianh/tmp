No British gymnast had ever made every final at a major international championships before.
The 17-year-old topped the all around standings, scoring 56.198, vault and floor in Romania, and also qualified for the beam and bars.
She will be joined in the all around by late addition Alice Kinsella, 16.

Elder Downie sister Becky also made the finals in the beam and the uneven bars, in which she is the defending champion, while Claudia Fragapane will go in the floor final.
"I had a really good time out there. It was probably some of my best performances," Ellie Downie told BBC Sport.
"I was nervous for bars but once I got that and beam out of the way I could just enjoy the rest."

She became Great Britain's first ever major all around individual medallist when she took European bronze in 2015.
Her all around score is 1.316 points ahead of the second-placed qualifier Zsofia Kovacs of Hungary.
And having made more history by making every final she will now aim to win her first major international gold medal.
"We'll just have to see [if I can win a gold medal]," said Ellie Downie.
"Today well really well but I have to come back and do it all again tomorrow [Friday]."
