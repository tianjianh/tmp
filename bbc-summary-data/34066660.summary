A man who was forced to work and live in a van for two weeks in Bolton is the subject of a human trafficking probe.

The 20-year-old responded to an advert in Poland for building work in the UK.
He told Greater Manchester Police (GMP) he was promised cash but received nothing and had been told to stay in the back of the vehicle.
The man and others were forced to live in the white Fiat Ducato, thought to be parked in Old Kiln Lane in Heaton, Bolton, earlier this month.
The victim spoke to officers on 17 August and a human trafficking investigation was launched.
Det Con Phil Warburton, of GMP, said: "From what we have been told, we believe other men may have been staying inside the van and we are keen to trace where this vehicle is.
"We are obviously concerned of the welfare of these people and are eager to find out if they are okay," Mr Warburton added.
He said they did not know the van's registration number, but it was believe to be parked in Heaton between 4 August and 18 August.
