Departing Portsmouth captain Michael Doyle says he would have signed a new contract at Fratton Park had an offer been made to him.

Doyle, 35, will rejoin Coventry City in July after leading Pompey to the League Two title in his second season.
Doyle says no formal offer was made despite manager Paul Cook saying he was part of his plans for next season.
"It's one of those things in football," Doyle told BBC Radio Solent. "Coventry came in and wanted to get it done."
"We've just achieved something special here at Portsmouth," added Doyle. "But we'll never know (about a new deal) as we didn't get into that situation."
Doyle's family are based in the Midlands and the Irish midfielder returns to a club he made more than 300 appearances for between 2003 and 2011.
"I spoke to the (Portsmouth) manager at the start of the week, but then Coventry expressed an interest," revealed Doyle.
"I just thought, 'what's best for me and my family at this time?' It was time to probably move on and family comes first. What's meant to be is what's meant to be.
"It was a hard decision to come to and once I spoke to Mark Robins, who was keen to get it done quickly, I thought it was right to go with a manager who wants me."
