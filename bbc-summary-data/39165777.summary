Surrey Police confirmed a property in Oxshott was burgled last weekend.
John Terry is reported to live in a seven-bedroom property in a half-acre country estate in the county.
A spokesman for Surrey Police said: "We can confirm that a burglary took place at a property in Moles Hill, Oxshott, overnight 25/26 February."
Thieves are said to have forced their way into the house and escaped with valuables while the 36-year-old Chelsea player was away with relatives, including his wife Toni, according to reports in the Sun.
