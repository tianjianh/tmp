The 53-year-old is believed to have hit a tree while on a blue ski run in the resort of La Plagne, in the French Alps, on Monday morning.
French media say mountain rescue service personnel attended but the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.
A spokesman from the UK Foreign Office said: "We are supporting the family of a British national who has sadly died in Macot-La-Plagne".
He added officials remain in contact with the French authorities, who are investigating the incident.
