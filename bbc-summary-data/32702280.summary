The 24-year-old Belgium attacker collected 53% of the votes from the 300-plus journalists who were polled.
Tottenham striker Harry Kane finished second, while Blues team-mate and captain John Terry was third.
Hazard, who signed for Chelsea in 2012, scored 20 goals in all competitions this season for the champions.
FWA chairman Andy Dunn, of the Sunday Mirror, said: "The list of truly world-class players on the Football Writers' Association roll of honour is a long one and Eden Hazard is a worthy addition.
"A creator, a goalscorer and the hardest of workers, Hazard has been a constant source of threat for the Premier League champions."
