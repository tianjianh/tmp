The man, in his 20s, got into difficulty at Alton Water reservoir in Tattingstone at about 20:00 BST. His body was later recovered from the water, police said.
The fire service has issued a warning to take care swimming in open water.
"We are asking people to stay safe following a tragic incident at Alton Water near Ipswich last night," they said.
"The best way to stay safe in or near the water is to take some sensible precautions and prevent accidents from happening," the force said on its Facebook page.
"Water is often a lot colder than you expect and it can impact on your physical capabilities. Just because you can swim well in a warm water pool doesn't mean you'll be able to swim well in cold water."
Suffolk Police said the man's death was currently being treated as unexplained "as is standard procedure".
"At this stage there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances," a spokesman added.
Alton Water is a man-made reservoir and water sports centre offering sailing and windsurfing courses.
