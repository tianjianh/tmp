The RSPCA has launched an investigation after being given home footage of the street where it happened in Hartlepool.
They are looking for the man who they say is seen "violently stamping and kicking at the cat and slamming his bike tyre down".
Insp Stephanie Baines said the footage was "very upsetting to watch".
The condition of the cat is not known.
A man is seen cycling into Brian Honour Avenue with a small black dog running beside him.
"The dog can be seen darting all over the road and pavements and is clearly out of control," Insp Baines said.
"It then shoots off to a parking area behind the houses and attacks a light-coloured cat."
The man then appears to join in the attack.
She added: ""The cat eventually escapes and runs to hide under a car. We do not know who the cat belongs to or what injuries it sustained in the attack."
The RSPCA is appealing for information to find out exactly what happened and has reported it to police.
