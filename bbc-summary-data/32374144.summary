Earlham Park Cafe was initially told it would have to close on 23 and 24 May for "safety" reasons.
About 50,000 music fans are expected to attend the event, which will feature Taylor Swift and Years & Years.
Norwich City Council said it had "reached an agreement" with the cafe to allow it to trade over the weekend.
A spokeswoman said: "The whole of Norwich is looking forward to some great music and we hope they enjoy a very busy trading weekend."
Ingrid Henry, who runs the cafe, said she was overwhelmed by the support they received.
"We had a phenomenal outpouring of support from local businesses, our customers, and the people who use Earlham Park who really thought we should be allowed to open and trade for that weekend," she said.
"We are very pleased that Norwich City Council and Radio 1 are going to allow us to trade for the weekend."
