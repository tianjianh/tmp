[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Luke Berry scored twice as Cambridge eased past Notts County 4-0.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They led at half-time courtesy of Berry's 19th-minute goal, which came when he charged down goalkeeper Adam Collin's kick and saw the ball rebound into the net, before blowing their opponents away in the second half.
Uche Ikpeazu made it 2-0, slotting the ball under Collin following Blair Adams' surging run out of defence, before Berry doubled his tally four minutes later.
His first effort was saved by Collin but he was able to scoop the ball in off the underside of the bar despite being on the ground.
On 69 minutes, Piero Mingoia added a fourth, benefiting from another defensive error as Harrison Dunk robbed Louis Laing and allowed Mingoia to finish easily beyond Collin.
Notts County barely threatened a response, with Will Norris beating a powerful Curtis Thompson shot away with virtually his only action.
They have now lost nine league games in a row while the Us have dropped only two points in their last seven league matches.
