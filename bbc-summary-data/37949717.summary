A Légion d'Honneur medal destined for a World War Two veteran was instead received by staff at a supermarket.

France's highest military honour was meant to be posted to former soldier Joseph Carter, who was part of the Normandy landings in 1944.
But no postcode on the package meant it was delivered to Costco in Waterloo Road, Liverpool 3, instead of to Mr Carter at Waterloo Road, L22.
Costco passed it to the Royal British Legion who found Mr Carter on Friday.
On being told about the attempts to find him, Mr Carter quipped: "I bet you thought I was dead, didn't you."
The French embassy, who posted the medal, has apologised for the error.
A spokesman said: "The embassy uses the addresses which are given by the veterans themselves when they send their application."
Prior to Mr Carter being found, Bill Sergeant, from the Royal British Legion, told BBC Radio Merseyside he wanted to hand over the medal in time for Remembrance Sunday.
He said it was found by staff at the store in their mail last month.
Mr Sergeant added: "It has been lingering around in Costco for a couple of weeks now, waiting for the French consulate to collect it.
"I was selling poppies there last week when one of the managers asked if I could help.
"I've tried hard and failed miserably, I've used up one pair of shoes tramping around trying to find this address without success."
A few hours after Mr Sergeant said he was "throwing it open" to see if anyone could help, the veteran was found.
A worker at the Costco branch said they had kept the medal for about four weeks and contacted the French embassy.
In 2014, French President François Hollande announced the honour would be awarded to all British veterans who took part in military operations in France between 1944 and 1945.
