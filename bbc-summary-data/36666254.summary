The 28-year-old centre-back, who made 40 appearances for the Terriers last season, has agreed a three-year deal with the R's.
"He offers us something a little bit different," QPR manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink said.
"He's left-sided, which will give us better balance, and has that ability to bring the ball out from the back."
Former Brighton and Nottingham Forest player Lynch, who can also play at left-back, joined Huddersfield in 2012 and scored nine goals in 128 appearances for the Yorkshire club.
He becomes QPR's second signing of the summer, following the arrival of Polish midfielder Ariel Borysiuk at Loftus Road last week.
