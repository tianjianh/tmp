Kristopher Jane, 31, from Bristol, assaulted the child while being filmed by a 17-year-old girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
The teenager, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, was sentenced alongside Jane at Cambridge Crown Court to four years' detention.
Judge David Farrell branded Jane a "dangerous and sickening paedophile".
The pair had admitted a string of sex charges at an earlier hearing at Peterborough Crown Court.
Footage of the assault, found on Jane's phone by police, was called "appalling and depraved" by the judge.
The video showed the toddler crying and trying to push Jane's hand away.
Jane admitted 12 offences, including sexual activity with a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.
The 17-year-old co-defendant admitted six offences.
Judge Farrell told her: "You knew full well what you were doing was wrong, and very wrong."
The pair were both handed sexual harm prevention orders.
