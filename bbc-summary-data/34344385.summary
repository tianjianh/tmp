Australia may block US singer Chris Brown from entering the country because of his domestic violence conviction.

Brown's announcement last week he would tour in December sparked criticism on social media and an online petition.
The Federal government said on Thursday it was reviewing Brown's visa application in light of his conviction.
Australia's Minister for Women, Senator Michaelia Cash, said the government was not afraid to "say no".
"People need to understand, if you are going to commit domestic violence and you want to travel around the world, there are going to be countries that say to you, 'You cannot come in because you are not of the character that we expect in Australia'", Senator Cash said.
Her comments were made at a press conference in Melbourne where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced a national domestic violence prevention program.
The review of Brown's visa follows the government's decision earlier this year to refuse a visa for world champion boxer Floyd Mayweather on similar grounds.
Mayweather had been booked for dinner and nightclub appearances in Sydney and Melbourne in January.
The 37-year-old American has a criminal record, which includes serving two months in jail in 2012, after pleading guilty to an assault on his former partner in front of their children.
