Peter Rombough, 22, from Ditchingham, Norfolk, admitted travelling 93 miles to stalk Mrs Womack at her home in Bedfordshire twice last year.
He was handed an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, at Great Yarmouth Magistrates' Court.
In a statement read out to the court, Mrs Womack said the events had left her feeling scared in her own home.
She added: "These events have had a massive impact.
"I can't stop thinking about it. He's a total stranger, but I'm concerned about his well-being and do hope he is okay and needs to seek some help."
Following the discovery of Rombough outside her home in September 2014, the police and the BBC organised extra security, the court heard.
He had been to look for her house four months earlier, but had been unable to find the property.
During his later visit, he left Mrs Womack a letter in which he said he feared he "couldn't deal with the consequences" of her rejecting him.
The court heard Rombough admitted he had an "unhealthy crush" on Mrs Womack which had first developed when he was 16.
In mitigation, Nicola Burt told the court Rombough accepted his actions were wrong "and how they impacted the victim".
Presiding magistrate Robin Hornby made Rombough the subject of a two-year restraining order and mental health programme.
"We must disregard that this was a high profile victim," he said.
"Stalking is stalking and it does not matter who it is. It is not a nice thing."
