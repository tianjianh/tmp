The recent storms have blown dozens of auk birds onto the east coast of Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA said it was caring for more than 100 of the auks at its National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fishcross.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said: "Little auks breed in the high arctic areas such as Greenland and Iceland, so it is unusual to see them up close."
Any other auk sightings can be reported on 03000 999 999.
Mr Seddon explained: "We have just over 100 little auks in our care at the moment which have been caught out by the recent storms.
"It is not uncommon for little auks to be found in the North Sea over winter but they have been blown off course and are landing in areas up and down the county, predominately along the east coast.
"The little auks we have rescued were found weak and thin and would have had great difficulty taking off once grounded."
