The RNLI has released footage of the rescue, involving a woman stranded by the incoming tide on a sandbank at Uncle Tom's Cabin, Blackpool.
The woman, seen still clutching her mobile phone during the rescue, was taken to hospital as a precaution but has since been released.
RNLI volunteer Jonathon Horrocks said she had a "very lucky escape".
"By the time we reached her she was totally exhausted and was in very real danger of drowning," he said.
