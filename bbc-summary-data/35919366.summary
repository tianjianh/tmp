A man has appeared in court accused of trying to attack Crystal Palace's bald eagle mascot.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Daniel Boylett, 35, of Eltham, south-east London, was arrested after trouble at a Palace home game against Charlton Athletic on 23 September.
He did not enter a plea on a charge of attempted criminal damage to the eagle, worth an estimated Â£20,000.
He and two other men pleaded not guilty to violent disorder at Croydon Magistrates Court.
