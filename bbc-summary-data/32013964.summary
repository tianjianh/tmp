The bassist is the second member of the band to leave after drummer Matt Tong quit in 2013.
Bloc Party have started work on their fifth studio album, the follow-up to 2012's Four.
Young Legionnaire are made up of former Automatic singer-songwriter Paul Mullen, Moakes and drummer Dean Pearson.
Writing on Twitter, Moakes said: "Update for fans: I'm not involved in the latest incarnation of Bloc Party. I'm now focussing on Young Legionnaire. Gordy #rhythmsection4hire.
"I'm based in Austin, TX now - as well as the new YL album in the works, I've got a couple of projects on the go here, news of which soon! Gx."
It's unclear who'll replace Moakes in the band.
Bloc Party frontman Kele Okereke is currently touring his second solo album Trick.
