[SN]TITLE[SN]
Milton Keynes Dons 1-1 Walsall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Managerless MK Dons dropped into the League One relegation zone, despite Dean Bowditch's last-minute leveller salvaging a draw against Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Laird's second goal of the season midway through the first half looked set to hand Jon Whitney's team all three points.
But Bowditch's seventh goal of the season ensured the spoils were shared.
The hosts were the first to go close after 12 minutes when Ben Reeves cleverly created space in the Walsall box before firing a half-volley just wide of Neil Etheridge's right-hand post.
But it was the visitors who took the lead when Josh Ginnelly's accurate cross from the right found Laird unmarked inside the MK Dons six-yard box and the 28-year-old powerfully headed home.
The Dons came out from the half-time break with purpose and struck a post through Bowditch on 52 minutes before Saddlers forward Erhun Oztumer's strike flew just wide on the hour.
But Bowditch's last-minute left-footed strike from the edge of the box flew past Walsall keeper Etheridge and into the bottom corner.
Report supplied by the Press Association.
Walsall boss Jon Whitney told BBC WM: "I'm disappointed we didn't see out the win because that's what we deserved, but sometimes that's football, you don't always get your rewards.
"First half especially, I thought we controlled it. They're a really good technical team, with some really good individual players, but our recovery and shape limited their threat.
"That carried on to the second half and we created enough chances to win the game.
"Maybe we could have killed the game a little bit better but we'll look at it and learn from it."
