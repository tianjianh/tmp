The duo were chosen after taking bronze in the World Cup event in Poznan at the weekend ahead of team-mates Nathaniel Reilly-O'Donnell and Matthew Tarrant.
They were named in a group of 12 this month from which the men's eight, pair and two reserves were to be confirmed.
Reilly-O'Donnell and Tarrant will travel to the Olympics as support.
Innes said: "Everything has hung in the balance for the last few months and finally being selected to race the men's pair for Team GB in Rio is a dream come true.
"We now have a big job in front of us and look forward to the challenge."
Scotland's Sam Scrimgeour will also travel to Rio as the lightweight men's reserve.
The announcements mean 44 of the 47 available places have now been filled.
