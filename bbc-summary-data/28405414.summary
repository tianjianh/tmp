The body of late US DJ Casey Kasem has been transported to Canada amid a bitter family feud.

The body of Kasem, who hosted US radio show American Top 40 and was the voice of Shaggy in Scooby-Doo, was moved to Montreal a month after his death.
His second wife Jean had the body moved before his daughter Kerri took out a restraining order in an attempt to keep it in Tacoma, Washington.
The pair were also involved in a court battle over his care before his death.
He had suffered from Lewy body disease, a form of dementia, at the end of his life.
A death certificate from the State of Washington said the body was moved to a Urgel Bourgie funeral home in Montreal on 14 July.
Corey Gaffney, president of Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma, Washington, told the Canadian Press: "What we did was made sure that Casey got to the airport, we released custody of Casey to the airline.
"The airline signed for that and acknowledged that and then at that point we returned to our office, tracked his flight to Montreal, confirmed that he had arrived, reported that to Mrs Kasem.
"When he landed in Montreal, I ceased being the funeral director in charge."
A representative for Urgel Bourgie in Montreal declined to give any information on the case.
Kerri Kasem is seeking court authorisation for an autopsy. On 15 July, she obtained a temporary restraining order to prevent it being moved from Tacoma or being cremated.
However, when her lawyer presented the restraining order to the Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma, he was told the remains were no longer there.
Before her father's death, Kerri Kasem accused Jean of "elder abuse" by isolating their father from his children.
In May, Jean Kasem took her husband from a California nursing home to friends in Washington state after courts in California awarded Kerri temporary conservatorship over her father's care.
A court later ruled that Kerri should be in charge of his medical care, not her stepmother.
A judge then agreed to Kerri's daughter's request to withhold food, liquid and medication, against her stepmother's wishes, after he failed to respond to treatment.
The DJ had prepared a statement saying he did not want "life-sustaining procedures" if he had no cognitive function and no hope of recovery.
The broadcaster began his career in the 1950s and found fame with the chart programme.
He famously ended his broadcasts with his signature sign-off: "Keep your feet on the ground and keep reaching for the stars."
After spells hosting countdown shows under other titles, he returned to American Top 40 in the 1990s and retired from the airwaves in 2009.
Around the world, his radio rundown was broadcast in 50 countries and he was known for the spin-off TV show America's Top 10.
In Scooby-Doo, Kasem voiced the character of Shaggy from the first series in 1969 until 1995, and again from 2002 until 2009.
