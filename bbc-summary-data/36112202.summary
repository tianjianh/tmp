Welsh election: Party campaigns to abolish assembly

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A party is campaigning for the Welsh Assembly to be abolished as an "expensive mistake".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party has candidates on all five regional lists for the election in May.
Spokesman David Bevan said: "The Welsh Office and our 40 MPs in Westminster did the job perfectly well at a fraction of the cost.
"Anything that needs to be devolved - any issues - we say devolve it to the local authorities," he added.
