And, it seems he's still on a high because when Martin bumped into him on the SPOTY red carpet, Ore was still beaming after his big win.
He told Newsround 'I am loving life' and admitted he can be an emotional guy!
Aw, we think Ore will be smiling at that Glitterball trophy for quite a while yet. Congrats Mr. Oduba.
Take a look at the happy dancer chatting to Martin above.
