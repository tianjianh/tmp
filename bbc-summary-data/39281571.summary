£2bn Cardiff 'garden village' homes plans approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The latest plans for a new £2bn "garden village" with almost 6,000 homes on the outskirts of Cardiff have been passed by planners.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Redrow Homes was granted permission for the development which will include four schools, shops, health and sports facilities on fields near St Fagans.
Plasdwr will be developed over 20 years and will also see new roads, bus and cycle routes built.
But some had objected to the plans over traffic and environmental concerns.
Permission for the first phase of 1,000 homes near Pentrebane Road and Llantrisant Road has already been granted.
But the committee heard the latest application was the biggest the council had ever had to consider.
Along with schools and homes, the 368 hectare site (900 acres) on fields bordering Fairwater, St Fagans, Danescourt and Radyr, will include food stores, a GP surgery, allotments, restaurants and pubs.
Plasdŵr is expected to create more than 30,000 jobs over 20 years, mainly in the construction phase but also permanent jobs through the on-site facilities.
Work on the first phase of homes is due to start next month.
