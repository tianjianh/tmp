[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Halpin, 26, was found by police on Wednesday morning at a derelict hostel on Westgate Road in Newcastle.
Two men, aged 26 and 30, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug.
They have been bailed pending further inquiries.
A post-mortem examination is due to be held on Tuesday.
Mr Halpin, from Heaton in Newcastle, was making a documentary about sleeping rough on the streets when he died.
He said he intended to "immerse myself" in the lifestyle of a homeless person.
Mr Halpin worked at Northumbria Students' Union and co-founded Novel Magazine, which covers arts and culture in the North East.
Kerry Kitchin, a friend since school and co-founder of Novel Magazine, said Mr Halpin had a "sociable nature".
He said: "He didn't even tell me he was doing this documentary, because he thought I'd disapprove of it and have a go at him for it, but, despite what's happened, I still wouldn't have. I think it was a noble idea."
