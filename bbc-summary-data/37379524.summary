[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The brooding face of Det Ch Insp Tom Mathias from TV drama Hinterland could soon be staring out at people in Ceredigion.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Plans have been submitted to Ceredigion council to paint a mural on the side of a building in Aberystwyth.
It would feature Richard Harrington, who plays the lead role in the programme, which is filmed in the area.
If approved, the mural would be painted on the exterior wall of the Art Shop on Pier Street.
The bilingual S4C drama - called Y Gwyll in Welsh and Hinterland in English - has been exported to the US and was first screened on TV there in June.
