Wynter, who can play anywhere across the midfield, made 12 league appearances for Bromley last season after joining the club in November.
The 23-year-old former Arsenal trainee has also previously had spells with Cheltenham and Bristol City.
Meanwhile, Woking have appointed former Stevenage coach Jason Goodcliffe as their new assistant manager.
The former AFC Wimbledon captain, 43, had most recently finished a second spell as number two at Boreham Wood.
"I think he ticks all the boxes and we're looking forward to start working with him," said Woking boss Anthony Limbrick.
