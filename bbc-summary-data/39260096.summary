Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) said the tyre marks were left at Loch Fleet near Golspie over the weekend.
Last month, the agency and Police Scotland highlighted problems with off-road machines at Loch Fleet and also on Ben Wyvis, a mountain near Dingwall.
Both areas are protected sites of special scientific interest.
SNH has asked any witnesses to the damage being caused to contact police.
