The 31-year-old is eligible to play in Wednesday's Scottish Championship home match against St Mirren.
Last week, with three goalkeepers injured, Raith fielded midfielder Ryan Stevenson in goal for the 1-0 defeat by Ayr United.
As well as his homeland, Penksa has also played club football in Cyprus, Czech Republic and Hungary.
Rovers have Kevin Cuthbert and Aaron Lennox out for up to six weeks while fellow keeper Conor Brennan faces around four more weeks on the sidelines.
