Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has said his side need to be more adventurous to improve their form in front of goal.

The Reds, who host Norwich City on Sunday, have scored three goals from five Premier League games this term.
"I think, for some reason, that wee bit of risk has gone out of our game," said Rodgers, whose side have not won in five games.
"We need to ensure we take those risks in order to create in the game and bring that intensity to it."
Liverpool have an impressive scoring record against the Canaries, having found the net 21 times in their last five meetings with the Norfolk club.
Norwich are level on seven points with the Anfield side and sit one place above them in ninth.
Rodgers has more firepower at his disposal, following forward Adam Lallana's goal-scoring return from a thigh problem in Thursday's 1-1 Europa League draw with Bordeaux. Daniel Sturridge is also nearing full fitness after a number of injuries.
"I think when Adam has played he has been excellent and if he plays consistently over a period of time, Adam will reach the numbers that we would like from him - I think it is only injuries that have curbed that so far," said Rodgers.
