[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 1-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ian Black's second-half equaliser earned Shrewsbury a hard-fought 1-1 draw at AFC Wimbledon despite having Ivan Toney sent off late on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lyle Taylor's first league goal since the opening day of the season had put AFC Wimbledon ahead, only for Black to level matters after the break, with Shrewsbury holding on despite Toney receiving two yellow cards.
The Dons began sharply and led after six minutes when Taylor battled to win a corner, before losing his marker to meet a low delivery with a fierce shot past Jayson Leutwiler.
Shrewsbury ought to have been level after 10 minutes when Toney spurned a fantastic chance, ballooning his header from Junior Brown's cross well over.
The visitors rarely threatened after that but they equalised within 90 seconds of the restart when Black was given space to fire beyond James Shea from 25 yards.
Shea then kept out Shaun Whalley's long-range effort, before Leutwiler made a fantastic save of his own from Dom Poleon from two yards.
Shrewsbury were reduced to 10 men when Toney was shown a senseless second yellow in the 82nd minute, but Wimbledon could not make their advantage count.
