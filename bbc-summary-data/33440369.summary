Tube strike begins across London Underground network

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tube staff have gone on strike across the entire London Underground network in a row over pay and conditions.

The strike, which officially began at 18:30 BST, affects all Tube lines and finishes at 21:30 BST on Thursday.
London Underground (LU) warned there could be no services on Thursday as a result of the walk-out.
Strikes were called after LU and unions failed to agree a pay deal over new Night Tube services.
Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA), and Unite started their 24-hour strike at 18:30 BST.
Aslef drivers will start their 24-hour action from 21:30 BST, although disruption is anticipated to occur several hours either side of the start and finish times.
In a separate dispute, First Great Western staff also walked out for 48 hours at 18:30, causing disruption to services between London, the west of England and Wales.
People had to beat the crowds by leaving work early and getting the last Tubes out of the city.
But with noses pressed against backs and bodies crushed against the walls of shops, the realisation quickly dawned on them that everyone had the same idea.
The pressure started early.  From 16:00, people were sweeping down the street, almost jogging to reach the Tube entrance.
But the crowds grew too quickly and plans had to be changed. Commuters consulted their phones, hoping to find an alternative route.
Failing that, when buses were dismissed as too full, the favourite option seemed to be a resigned shrug of the shoulders and a plan to walk - trainers or not.
Wimbledon spectators planning to use the Tube were warned to leave "as soon as possible" during Andy Murray's match.
Ahead of the walk-out, Mayor of London Boris Johnson tweeted: "Tube strike politically motivated - union bosses need to explain why they refuse to put new offer to members - disgraceful - call it off!"
But the four unions involved maintain the new plans would be disruptive to their members' lives.
This is what you need to know about the Tube strikes
Commuter Billi-Jo Highdale, whose parents are both black cab drivers said: "I've got to get to the DLR somehow as I need to go from Greenwich to Mile End, or find a lift from someone. I had plans with a friend for tomorrow but I've had to cancel them.
"My parents are black cab drivers so they will do well.  It's as good as a three-day weekend for them, although it sucks for everyone else."
Camilla Fleury, a fashion retailer, said: "I got out of work fine and I'll probably walk to a DLR line and then use that to get home. It's going to be a very long walk, but I hope I can do it within an hour."
Another commuter said: "I have no idea what to do tomorrow. My bosses are being understanding, but we have to show up in the office at some point."
The weekend night services are set to begin on 12 September on sections of the Central, Jubilee, Northern, Piccadilly and Victoria lines.
BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards said LU bosses said the date for introducing the night Tube could be put back. They said the date was "feasible...but not at any price".
There are concerns some employees will have to work more overnight shifts and may have to work on their own in some stations.
Transport for London (TfL) said extra buses, river boats and Santander Cycles would be provided during the strikes.
This Tube strike is as much about personalities as it is about the deal they are trying to hammer out.
The team negotiating for LU is new at this. The Chief Operating Officer, Steve Griffiths, joined from Virgin Atlantic earlier this year, and my understanding is that no-one on the management side of the table has experience dealing with rail deals.
Not that long ago, bosses on both sides would have got together, informally, maybe over a beer, to see if they could smooth the path for an agreement.
That hasn't happened this time.
So, we've got a group of frustrated unions. A frustrated LU. And four million Tube passengers in the middle.
Both sides think the other is being unreasonable.
Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any of those old, informal lines of communication open right now, which in the past might have just sorted this out.
TfL warned roads and public transport would be much busier than usual and advised travelling outside normal rush-hour periods.
About 20,000 Tube workers are expected to walk out.
On Monday, unions rejected LU's latest pay deal, which it said was an increased but "final" pay offer made "in an attempt to conclude five months of talks".
It included a 2% rise this year and Â£2,000 for drivers on the weekend night Tube service.
Mr Johnson told the BBC: "What we've done is made an extremely good offer, that I think most Londoners would think was more than handsome."
Unions would "not succeed" in their aims, he said, and urged them to accept the pay offer, which he described as "final".
He said it was "absolutely wrong to hold London to ransom" and apologised for the disruption, which he warned would be "very considerable".
Finn Brennan, Aslef's organiser said the responsibility of the strikes "rests squarely with London Underground management" who "squandered the window of opportunity" to resolve it.
The TSSA union also rejected the offer and general secretary Manuel Cortes said: "This dispute is not just about pay, but about how to run a safe and secure night Tube which serves the passengers as well as rewarding the staff."
Talks are set to resume on Friday.
Labour leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a Commons motion expressing dismay at the "disgraceful" treatment of Tube workers.
He has called on Mr Johnson to withdraw the "imposition" of night working.
The motion states uncontrolled and unmanaged night work can have a serious impact on the physical and mental health and well-being of staff as well as a detrimental impact on family and social life.
