Devon hospital paediatrician in court for child abuse images

A paediatrician has appeared in court charged with making and distributing indecent images of children.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonathan Walsh from Barnstaple faces two counts of making and five counts of distributing images between January 2014 and August 2015.
The 46-year-old was dismissed in June by Northern Devon Healthcare Trust (NDHT) after his arrest last year.
Mr Walsh was bailed at Exeter Crown Court and will enter his pleas at his next hearing on 9 September.
The NDHT confirmed none of the charges related to patients at its hospitals and a hotline had been set up for anyone with concerns.
