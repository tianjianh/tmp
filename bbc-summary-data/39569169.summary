Police have revealed more details of the incident as they continue the hunt for the attacker who struck in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Det Insp Scott Young said the assault had lasted "several minutes" and had been a "horrendous attack".
He said extra patrols were under way in the area in order to provide reassurance to the public.
"At about one o'clock on Sunday morning the victim was returning from an evening socialising with friends in Dumfries town centre," he said.
"As he approached the area of Millburn Avenue and Brooms Road an unidentified offender has approached him, presented a weapon and taken him to a secluded area out of public view.
"He has then been subjected to a terrifying attack and was raped."
The attacker headed off in the direction of the nearby Morrisons supermarket after the assault.
Police have described him as about 6ft 1in tall and of stocky, muscular build. He was wearing dark clothing and possibly had a foreign accent.
"Extensive inquiries are under way, specialist officers have been deployed to conduct the investigation and provide support to the victim," said the senior investigating officer.
"I would also like to take this opportunity to reassure members of the community that this is a highly unusual crime to happen in Dumfries.
"We have increased patrols in the area to provide that community reassurance and keep people safe."
Anyone with information about the incident or who was in the area at the time has been asked to contact the police.
