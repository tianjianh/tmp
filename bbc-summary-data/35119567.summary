Liam Williams: Welsh boxer claims British belt with stunning win

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Undefeated Welsh boxer Liam Williams claimed the vacant British light-middleweight title with a stunning second-round win over Kris Carslaw.

Williams knocked out his Scottish opponent with a solid left-hand jab in the opening seconds of round two.
The 23-year-old was fighting for the first time in 13 months after recovering from two hand operations.
He now hopes to meet Liam Smith, who defended his WBO title against Jimmy Kelly on the same bill in Manchester.
There were ominous signs for Carslaw as Williams, who also holds the Commonwealth title, began to dominate towards the end of the first round.
A series of body shots forced the Scot down to one knee, and he waited until the last possible moment before getting back to his feet.
But the fight was over after only six seconds of the second round when a routine-looking jab to the temple floored Carslaw.
The referee stopped the contest immediately without a count, giving Williams his eighth knockout victory in 13 wins.
