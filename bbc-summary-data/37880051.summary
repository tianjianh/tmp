Wales to wear an emblazoned jersey against Australia in memory of Aberfan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales will wear an emblazoned jersey against Australia in memory of the 50th anniversary of the Aberfan disaster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The squad requested the jerseys be embroidered with details of the disaster after visiting the memorial gardens and cemetery in Aberfan.
Black armbands will also be worn in memory of Alun Wyn Jones' father Tim, who died this week.
"Thoughts and prayers of the squad are with Alun Wyn and his family at this difficult time," a statement said.
The specially made jersey references the 116 children and 28 adults killed when a coal waste tip collapsed on to a school and neighbouring houses on 21 October, 1966.
