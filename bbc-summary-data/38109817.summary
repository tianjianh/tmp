Thiago headed the champions ahead after Bernd Leno parried Philipp Lahm's shot.
Hakan Calhanoglu scored a brilliant leveller for the visitors, smashing the ball over Manuel Neuer at his near post after a one-two with Julian Brandt.
But Hummels headed in Joshua Kimmich's corner to win it for the hosts.
Bayern, who are chasing a fifth consecutive league title, had lost their previous two games in all competitions, and failed to win in three, in a relatively slow start under manager Carlo Ancelotti.
Elsewhere, Borussia Dortmund dropped down to sixth after a 2-1 defeat at Eintracht Frankfurt, with Haris Seferovic scoring the winner moments after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's equaliser.
Fifth-placed Hoffenheim drew 1-1 at Borussia Monchengladbach to remain unbeaten - although they have only won five of their 12 games.
Former Arsenal midfielder Serge Gnabry continued his good season with the equaliser as Werder Bremen drew 2-2 at relegation rivals Hamburg.
