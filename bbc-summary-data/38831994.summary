The Crown Office said a preliminary hearing has been fixed for 7 February at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
The inquiry, which will also be held in Edinburgh, is due to begin on 17 July.
It will consider the deaths of Joy Robson at the Snowman Rally in 2013 and Iain Provan, Elizabeth Allan and Len Stern at the Jim Clark Rally in 2014.
Previously, the Crown Office said the inquiry would examine the full circumstances surrounding the deaths and "help to avoid such incidents happening in the future".
Earlier this month, it was announced that the Jim Clark Rally planned for 2017 had been cancelled after the sport's UK governing body refused a permit.
Mr Provan, 64, his partner Ms Allan, 63, and Mr Stern, 71, were killed when a car involved in the rally spun off the course in May 2014.
Ms Robson, 50, who was struck by a car taking part in the Snowman Rally in Inverness in February 2013.
