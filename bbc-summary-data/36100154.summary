The first direct flights from Scotland to Jamaica will also be offered next summer, for three weeks from Glasgow Airport.
Holiday companies Thomson and First Choice will operate the links.
Graeme Bell, general manager at Inverness Airport, said the flights to Majorca would be a "fantastic addition" to the airport's holiday route network.
The flights would connect holidaymakers to several resorts, including Sa Coma on the east coast of Majorca.
Services from Glasgow to Montego Bay are to be offered for three weeks from June 2017.
Thomson and First Choice are also introducing new flights from Glasgow to Sal in Cape Verde this winter and again next summer.
The companies said the Jamaica flights would serve popular resorts including Lucea, Montego Bay, Negril, Ocho Rios and Trelawny.
Glasgow Airport has welcomed the announcement.
