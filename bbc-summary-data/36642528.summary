The London-born sprinter, who was a kit carrier at the 2012 London Olympics, said: "It was an amazing experience.
It is the volunteers who will make the event feel truly special
"I would say to everyone they should get involved as it will be one of the most amazing experiences of your life."
Up to 4,000 volunteers will be needed to deliver the events in the stadium, Olympic Park and across London.
It will be the first time that the two championships will be taking place in the same city in the same year.
Anyone interested in becoming a 'runner' for the events can register their interest from 28 June here and details of the application form will be sent in early Autumn 2016.
Asher-Smith is the fastest-ever British woman and will be representing Team GB at the 2016 Rio Olympics from 5-21 August.
"The athletes at London 2017 will produce incredible moments which will last a lifetime," she added. "But it is the volunteers who will make the event feel truly special."

Richard Whitehead, the reigning Paralympic, world and European T42 200m champion said: "In 2012, the Games Makers were instrumental in creating the incredible atmosphere at the Paralympic Games.
"I am both grateful to and passionate about supporting the volunteer programme."
Volunteers will be required in a range of roles during the 20 days of the events including transport, way-finding, meet and greet and accreditation.
"Hundreds of thousands of people will come from all over the world to the British capital next summer for the championships and the 'runners' will be a key part of their experience," said IAAF president Lord Coe.
