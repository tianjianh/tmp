A rare total solar eclipse wowed spectators in northern Australia.

Crowds had gathered on the beach in Queensland to see the amazing sight of the sun being blocked out by the moon.
Lots of people took photos and others just stared into the sky in wonder at what they were seeing.
It was important that the weather was clear so that the sun could be seen, luckily there weren't too many clouds so people got a good view.
