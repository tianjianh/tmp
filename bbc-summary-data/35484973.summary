Scottish Championship ins and outs - January 2016

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rangers and Falkirk splashed the cash, but it was promotion rivals Hibernian who stole the headlines during January with the capture of Anthony Stokes on loan from Celtic.

The Republic of Ireland striker, frozen out by Ronny Deila in Glasgow following off-field misdemeanors, has scored two goals in two appearances already for the side chasing Rangers for the one automatic promotion place from the Scottish Championship.
Michael O'Halloran, Rangers' deadline-day acquisition from St Johnstone, will have to go some to match the influence Stokes can have on the Edinburgh side.
However, Billy King, the winger on loan from Hearts, made his mark with a debut goal for the Ibrox side.
Third-top Falkirk opened their cheque book to emphasise their desire to clinch a play-off place at the very least.
They took skilful forward Myles Hippolyte from Championship rivals Livingston and Nathan Austin from East Fife, although the latter is one for future campaigns after being immediately loaned back to the League Two club.
Livingston themselves used some of the money from the Hippolyte deal to buy midfielder Josh Mullin from Albion Rovers, manager David Hopkin having already added some notable names with top-flight experience - including Mark Fotheringham, Charlie Telfer and Sam Stanton - in their bid to avoid the drop.
New St Mirren manager Alex Rae is also banking on experience as the Paisley side look to move away from the bottom and has recruited four players who have played in the top flight.
One-time Aberdeen striker Declan McManus looks like he will be a quality addition on his return to Greenock Morton on loan from Fleetwood Town.
Meanwhile, Raith Rovers are looking to harness the youthful talents of Aidan Connolly, the midfielder released by Dundee United, and forward Harry Panayiotou on loan from Leicester City.
Dumbarton will provide a platform for intriguing winger Kler Heh, a 19-year-old who was brought up in a refugee camp in Thailand.
