Works include a pedestrian and cycle bridge across the A63 and extensions to the city's art gallery and theatre.
The bridge will cost £11.5m and will link the city centre with Hull's waterfront, which is being redeveloped.
The Ferens Art Gallery will get a £4.5m facelift ahead of it hosting the Turner Prize in 2017.
Labour councillor Sean Chaytor, chairman of Hull City Council's planning committee, said the bridge was "essential in working towards improving connectivity between two core areas of the city".
"We hope that the work to start the bridge construction can now get under way for early next year in order for it to be ready by Easter 2017," he said.
Hull was awarded the title of City of Culture in November 2013, beating competition from Swansea, Leicester and Dundee.
The year-long event takes place every four years and is awarded by the UK government with the aim of helping tourism and the economy.
