The two will go head to head at Pittodrie while Celtic and Rangers host lower-league opposition.
Brendan Rodgers's side face League One Alloa, with Championship side Queen of the South making the trip to Ibrox.
Greenock Morton will host fellow Championship side Dundee United at Cappielow, with the ties set to take place on 20, 21 or 22 September.
St Johnstone have already beaten Premiership opposition after coming from behind to beat Hearts 3-2 at McDiarmid Park, while Aberdeen safely negotiated their way past Ayr United with a 2-1 win.
"We're really grateful for the home tie," said Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes. "We enjoy playing against St Johnstone, we seem to get drawn against them all the time.
"I don't think there's a lot between the teams. I'm pleased with the draw to be honest - it could have been easier, but it could have been tougher. We could have been playing away from home."
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright said: "We've had a few battles with them over the years. They're a top side but we've done well against the top sides.
"We can be a measure for anyone on our day and I think it's a cracking cup tie. It's probably the tie of the round."
Celtic cruised into the next round with a 5-0 win over Motherwell, and face an Alloa team who shocked Premiership Inverness Caledonian Thistle in a 1-0 win at Recreation Park.
"A home draw is always important," Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers told BBC Scotland. "We'll respect whoever we play and when that game comes around we'll prepare the same as any other game."
Queen of the South's prize for beating Hibernian at Easter Road is to face Mark Warburton's Rangers, who easily saw off Peterhead 5-0.
Championship sides Dundee United and Greenock Morton both knocked out Premiership opposition; a Cammy Smith hat-trick helping United past Partick Thistle, and Morton beating Hamilton 2-1.
