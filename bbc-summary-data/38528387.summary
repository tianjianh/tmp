Cornelius Van Der Wetering, 54, was last seen in the Tomich area, about 30 miles from Inverness, on Wednesday 28 December.

The death is not being treated as suspicious.
As with all sudden deaths, a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
Police Scotland said they were liaising with Mr Van Der Wetering's family in the Netherlands and thanked members of the public who took part in the search to find him.
