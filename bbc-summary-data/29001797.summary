[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hungary 1-2 Northern Ireland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northern Ireland snatched a first away win in four years as they began their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign with a priceless victory over Hungary.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tamas Priskin forced in a close-range header from a corner 15 minutes from time to edge Hungary in front.
But sub Niall McGinn levelled and Kyle Lafferty claimed the winner in the 88th minute, although the last touch may have been off a defender.
It was their first away win in 18 matches.
Northern Ireland's last victory on the road was a 1-0 win over Slovenia in their opening Euro 2012 qualifier.
Boss Michael O'Neill will be relieved as it appeared an encouraging display in Budapest was to go unrewarded.
Before the match, Northern Ireland probably would have settled for a draw but, having seen Hungary's limitations during the match, O'Neill must have known the chance for victory was there for the taking.
This was the start of O'Neill's second qualifying campaign as NI manager and, having started the first by taking only one from a possible nine, he will be jubilant with this result.
Corry Evans should have given them the lead just before half-time but he skied over after Jamie Ward's effort had been parried by former Liverpool reserve team goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.
As the second half wore on Hungary, regularly booed by home supporters, came into the game more and they looked set to take the points when former Watford striker Priskin headed home a 74th-minute corner from just a couple of yards out.
It seemed to be the same old story for Northern Ireland but two goals in the last 10 minutes turned the game on its head.
Front man Lafferty was instrumental in the equaliser, coming deep for the ball before charging forward.
He broke into the penalty area and passed across goal for McGinn to tap home unchallenged.
Even better was to come for the 1100 visiting supporters as Lafferty battled with a home defender to bundle in at the back post from McGinn's ball in.
The 88th-minute finish was hardly elegant but for Northern Ireland it could not have been sweeter.
