[SN]TITLE[SN]
WW1 British soldiers' remains to be reburied near Ypres

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Six British soldiers are to be reburied in Belgium with full military honours more than 100 years after they were killed in action in World War One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Remains of the unknown soldiers were found in 2008 and 2010 in a farmer's field near the town of Ypres.
Two of the men were from the King's Own (Royal Lancaster) Regiment and two from the Lancashire Fusiliers. The regiments of the other two men are not known.
The Ministry of Defence said it had not been possible to trace any relatives.
The men were killed in battle in October 1914, the MoD said.
It is thought they were given field burials at the time. Their bodies were found in the Comines-Warneton area, just south of Ypres.
They will be reinterred during a funeral service at the nearby Prowse Point Military Cemetery, where more than 200 UK and Commonwealth servicemen are buried.
The service will include the hymns Jerusalem and I vow to thee my country, and a reading by the British ambassador to Belgium, Alison Rose.
