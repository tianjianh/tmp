The number of international visitors to Wales rises

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 930,000 visits were made to Wales by international tourists in 2014, new figures show.

The number represents a 65,000 rise on the previous year while spending was also up by more than Â£18m to Â£368m.
The results come on the day Prime Minister David Cameron announced a five-point plan to boost tourism in every region of the UK.
Wales Office Minister Lord Bourne said the move would "help Wales' tourism sector continue to thrive".
