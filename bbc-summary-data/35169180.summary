Carwyn Jones said Wales had a "proud tradition of being a friendly and hospitable nation".
"The message of peace and hope is particularly poignant this year," he said, referring to the terrorist attacks in Tunisia and Paris.
About 50 refugees from Syria have been re-settled in Wales with more to come.
Torfaen, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot and Caerphilly have been the first councils to welcome refugees, with more to be dispersed to other areas in the new year.
In his seasonal message to the nation, Mr Jones said:  "At Christmas, it's more important than ever that we spread the message of togetherness and unity in our Welsh communities.
"We have a proud tradition of being a friendly and hospitable nation.
"As fifty Syrian refugees make their home in Wales, they will be experiencing their first festive season in the UK - I'm sure they'll get a warm Welsh welcome and we wish them well in their new lives."
The first minister also asked people to "spare a thought" for those working over Christmas - such as the emergency services, medical professionals, charities, care workers and the armed forces - who "all deserve our thanks".
"They work tirelessly while we enjoy ourselves," he said.
