Head coach Eddie Jones picked the Sale Sharks fly-half, 27, as part of a 26-man squad for the camp in Brighton.
Northampton's Teimana Harrison, Sale's Mike Haley and Bath's Charlie Ewels are among the uncapped players chosen.
Players from Saracens, Exeter, Wasps and Leicester - who are in the Premiership semi-finals - will not attend the 17-19 May camp.
Those involved in the Premiership final on Saturday, 28 May are also unlikely to feature when England host Wales at Twickenham a day later.
Joe Marler is named in the training squad, meaning the Harlequins forward could face Samson Lee for the first time since he was banned for calling the Wales prop "Gypsy boy" in March.
England will then travel to Australia for a three-match Test series in June.
"There's lots of hard work to be done if we are going to play with the intensity needed to beat southern hemisphere teams," said Jones.
England squad, forwards: Dave Attwood, Kieran Brookes, Jack Clifford, Charlie Ewels, Dylan Hartley, Teimana Harrison, Paul Hill, Matt Kvesic, Courtney Lawes, Joe Marler, Chris Robshaw, Kyle Sinckler, Tommy Taylor.
Backs: Mike Brown, Luther Burrell, Danny Care, Danny Cipriani, Ollie Devoto, George Ford, Jonathan Joseph, Mike Haley, Alex Lewington, Semesa Rokoduguni, Anthony Watson, Marland Yarde, Micky Young.
