Rugby World Cup 2015: England let country down - Chris Robshaw

England captain Chris Robshaw says his team "let the whole nation down" after a 33-13 defeat by Australia led to a pool-stage exit from the World Cup.

Victory for the Wallabies sent them and Wales through to the quarter-finals, with England the first World Cup host nation not to reach that stage.
"We feel we let the country down today. We apologise to them," Robshaw said.
Head coach Stuart Lancaster said it was "too raw" to consider his own position following the loss at Twickenham.
"During the last three years we've put in some pretty good performances, but on the day Australia were better," Lancaster told BBC Radio 5 live. "And that's what World Cups are all about - on the day.
"But there are some good players in this squad and I hope the nation stays behind them. Will I be staying behind them as their coach? It's not for me to say. I've just got to get them ready for next week."
England take on Uruguay in their final group game on Saturday, 10 October.

England began their World Cup campaign with a hard-fought bonus-point win over Fiji, but defeat by Wales last week left them needing to beat the Wallabies to remain in the tournament.
Since Lancaster took over in 2011, England have recorded eye-catching victories over world champions New Zealand and Australia, but have been unable to lift the Six Nations title and have now failed to make it out of their World Cup pool for the first time.
"Results wouldn't say it in terms of the World Cup, but overall we've won more games than we've lost and we've had some big scalps," Lancaster, 45, said.
"I think they're a fantastic group of players, they're great ambassadors for the country and fantastic role models. They've come up short today, but I don't think they'll come up short in the future."
England dominated many of the attacking statistics at Twickenham, but Australia had the better of the breakdown, winning eight turnovers.
Lancaster described Australia number eight David Pocock, who won three of those turnovers, as "outstanding" and "a special player".
Robshaw, 29, added: "They put us under a lot of pressure. We had a spell in the second half where we built a bit of momentum, but to come back from a 17-3 half-time deficit against a quality side like that was always going to difficult.
"A lot of hard work has gone into it but, for whatever reason, we haven't got the results we wanted."
