Scotland: Gordon Strachan backs 'Yoda' Craig Brown's comments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland coach Gordon Strachan accepts the view of predecessor Craig Brown that the current squad lacks the quality to compete at the top level.

Brown, Scotland boss from 1993-2001, suggested the current crop of players' lack of European experience made them unprepared for major tournaments.
"Craig is probably the Yoda of Scottish football," said Strachan, referencing the Star Wars character.
"I understand exactly what he is saying when you look at the squad."
Brown said the quality of player Strachan has to choose from has significantly diminished since he led Scotland to qualification for the 1998 World Cup in France, the national side's last appearance at a major tournament.
Strachan has named his squad for overseas matches against Italy (29 May) and France (4 June) - preparation for World Cup qualifiers later this year.
Unlike England, Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and Wales, Scotland will not be going to Euro 2016.
"None are playing European football in there," said Strachan of his player pool.
"When you went back to Craig's day there was a lot playing [European football]. If you go back 10 years ago you find a lot playing European football. So that is where we are at the moment, so he has a valid point.
"But what I have got when I get this group together is a great bunch of lads and that is why we have to work as a team, and we have to put in more hours because we do not have the individuals that other international teams have got.
"[Zlatan] Ibrahimovic with Sweden - he makes them. [Wales' Gareth] Bale, although he is well backed up by some good players, and [Poland's Robert] Lewandowski. If we had one of them we would be going to the European Championships now."
