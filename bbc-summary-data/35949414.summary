Paul Rutherford's brace saw Southport all but secure their National League status with victory over relegation-threatened Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rutherford opened the scoring when he headed in Gary Jones' free-kick at the far post for his first of the season.
Craig Westcarr's fine cross was met by Rutherford with a bullet header into the top corner to double the lead.
Wood managed just one effort on target during the game, and never looked like mounting a comeback.
Southport are now 10 points clear of the relegation zone, whilst Boreham are two points from safety with three games left to play.
