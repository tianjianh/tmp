Janet Norridge, 34, was reported to Cardiff Prison governors after being spotted in the crowd by a colleague at the 2011 tournament event.
The inquest in Newport heard she was suspended from work and took her own life after losing an appeal.
The hearing was told her parents later won an employment tribunal.
A coroner is writing to the director of Her Majesty's Prison Service demanding a review of the way officers are treated during disciplinary proceedings.
The inquest heard Ms Norridge had ambitions of becoming a prison governor but was hit by a health scare - a relative had died of bowel cancer and she tested positive for a gene which gave her an 80 per cent chance of also getting the disease.
The inquest was told she went to the doctor and was given three weeks off work to come to terms with the shock.
But Ms Norridge went out with friends to see a live TV screening at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff of a 2011 Rugby World Cup match where she was seen by the colleague.
Friend Rebecca Rolls told the inquest: "She was interviewed by her employers who charged her with misconduct and lost her job.
"This destroyed Janet. She was so proud of her job and her profession."
Ms Norridge's mother Joanne said her daughter was "right in her feeling that she was unfairly dismissed" and that she suffered "unbelievable cruelty" by the prison authorities.
An employment tribunal in London two years later found in favour of Mrs Norridge and her husband John, ruling that prison officials had made an error in law by sacking their daughter, the inquest was told.
Gwent coroner David Bowen, returning a conclusion of suicide, said: "The tribunal ruled her dismissal was unfair however at the time of her death that ruling was in the future and not known to her.
"She felt she had been unfairly dismissed - that was the matter that playing on her mind."
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: "Our thoughts are with the family of Janet Norridge following this tragedy.
"We have noted the coroner's comments and will respond to his recommendations in due course."
