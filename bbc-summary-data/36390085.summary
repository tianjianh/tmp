[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A contract has been awarded to build a giant lorry park for 3,600 vehicles to help prevent traffic chaos for trucks crossing the English Channel.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highways England said Balfour Beatty has been chosen to undertake the £130m project in Kent.
Last summer, part of the M20 was used 32 times so lorries could queue during cross-Channel disruption, during a process known as Operation Stack.
The government has not yet decided where the lorry park will be built.
The plans were announced by the Chancellor George Osborne in November and a total of £250m was allocated to the project.
Two potential locations, both north of the M20 at junction 11 are being considered.
The Port of Dover has estimated the UK economy loses up to £250m per day when Stack is implemented.
It is anticipated the park will be partially open by summer 2017.
