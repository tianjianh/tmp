The Shots took an early lead through Rhys Browne's chipped finish, before Ryan Bowman headed in an equaliser.
The hosts then went ahead through CJ Hamilton's right-footed strike, but Jake Gallagher turned in Dan Walker's cross to level the scores.
McLaughlin put Gateshead back in front, and the Heed held on for their third successive home league win.
Aldershot Town boss Barry Smith told BBC Surrey:

"When you're away from home and you score two goals, you expect to take something from the game. I think we didn't deserve to win it, but we certainly didn't deserve to lose the game.
"Their third goal, for as much as I think the referee has got a very difficult job because he's got to watch a lot of things in the area, he missed a certain push on our player.
"If he sees the push the game ends 2-2, so we're disappointed and today we've seen one of the best goals they've scored this season."
