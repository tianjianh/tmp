The council said over 11,000 people had visited the zone in the city's Cooper's Field during the three group matches, which saw Wales end on top after beating Slovakia and Russia.
It will open from 15:00-20:00 BST on Saturday when Wales compete in Paris.
A spokesman said: "We hope as many as possible will join us on Saturday to cheer on our national team."
As yet, Wales do not know who they will be playing, but it will be one of either Northern Ireland, Albania or Turkey.
