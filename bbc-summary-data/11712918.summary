[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents of a coastal resort are to be given a final chance to comment on proposals for the redevelopment of the town centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The plans for the revamp of Bridlington town centre include a major investment in the harbour.
Residents can attend public exhibitions of the proposals at The Spa on Monday and Tuesday 8 and 9 November and Wednesday 10 and Friday 12 November.
Views should be given to Bridlington Renaissance by 29 November.
Liz Philpot, from the Bridlington Renaissance Partnership, said: "We really do need to be starting to look at other ways of not just attracting visitors, but making sure we're looking after the resident population.
"The major thrust of all of the town centre scheme is making sure the town provides the economic well-being for the people that live here and run businesses here and want to work here as well."
