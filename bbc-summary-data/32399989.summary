RSPCA: Animal cruelty cases rise but convictions down

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of complaints relating to deliberate cruelty to animals in Wales rose last year, the RSPCA said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It dealt with 1,389 complaints - up more than 100 on the previous year.
Cases included a puppy being thrown in a river with a head wound in Rhondda, a rabbit with severely overgrown teeth, hunting wild mammals with dogs in north Wales and animals with skin conditions in Haverfordwest.
But the number of people convicted was down from 79 in 2013 to 47 last year.
The charity added it had a 100% conviction rate.
RSPCA Cymru superintendent Martyn Hubbard said: "It is extremely concerning that we are still receiving more than 1,300 complaints about animals being deliberately caused to suffer.
"Most of the complaints we receive involve animals being neglected or not receiving the right care and often we can put that right by offering welfare advice.
"However, it is shocking that in 2014 people are still being deliberately cruel."
