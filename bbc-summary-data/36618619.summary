The Batley and Spen MP, 41, was attacked in Birstall, West Yorkshire, on 16 June. She was due to hold a constituency surgery in the village.
Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, has been charged with her murder.
The inquest was opened and adjourned by coroner Martin Fleming during a six minute hearing at Bradford Coroner's Court.
Det Supt Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, told the court it was immediately clear to paramedics and police the mother-of-two was very seriously injured.
The detective said she was pronounced dead by a doctor in an ambulance outside Birstall Library.
He confirmed a post-mortem examination had shown a preliminary cause of death as "multiple stab and gunshot wounds".
The coroner said Mrs Cox's body could now be released so the family can "get on with the grieving process".
