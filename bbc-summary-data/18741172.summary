[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman has admitted smashing a window at music mogul Simon Cowell's west London home with a broken brick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leanne Zaloumis, 29, of Catford, south-east London, attacked his Holland Park mansion on 24 March, Isleworth Crown Court heard.
She was granted bail but forbidden from contacting Mr Cowell or going within 300 yards of his home.
Zaloumis admitted intent to damage or destroy property but denied two other counts of affray and burglary.
The not guilty pleas were accepted by the Crown.
The court heard Mr Cowell, 52, was watching television in his bedroom when he heard a "loud bang" from his bathroom.
When police arrived they found Zaloumis hiding inside a walk-in wardrobe at the mansion.
Zaloumis was also said to have stood on Mr Cowell's roof, yelling at him and hurling items at his bathroom window.
The music mogul called his staff for help and was taken back to his bedroom during the incident, which happened at about 22:30 BST.
Judge John Denniss did not sentence Zaloumis because of administrative delays.
Bail was granted because she has already served three months in custody.
Zaloumis must stay at her home address and remain inside between 19:00 and 07:00.
She was also ordered to wear an electronic tag.
