Liverpool fan Adele is on BBC Radio 1 from Monday to Friday on Early Breakfast from 04:00 GMT to 06:30.
On the same days, Manchester United supporter A.Dot is on 1Xtra presenting 1Xtra Breakfast from 07:00 to 10:00.
The duo worked out most of their predictions together - but disagreed on the outcome of the BBC's live games - Derby v Leicester (Friday) and Millwall v Watford and United v Wigan (both Sunday).
A.Dot also got involved in BBC Sport's No Guts, No Glory campaign to share her tales of the magic of the FA Cup.

All kick-offs 15:00 GMT unless otherwise stated.
Derby County 2-2 Leicester
Lawro's prediction: 1-1* Leicester to win the replay
A.Dot: The FA Cup is all about upsets, and this is going to be the upset of this round. Derby are at home and in decent form in the Championship and Leicester are in awful form, especially away from home, making one the worst title defences in history.
Adele: I am probably going to go the other way. It is a huge East Midlands derby - they are not friends! - and I just feel the Foxes are going to pull it out, because they need to win something this season and I think they are going to throw everything at the FA Cup and try to win it.
A.Dot: Leicester have lost their last two matches 3-0. Psychologically, they are going to be down in the dumps. 2-1
Adele: But you cannot count out Foxes striker Jamie Vardy, you just can't. This is the FA Cup and it will mean everything to their players. I feel like Leicester are going to do it. 1-2

Lincoln City 3-1 Brighton
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Adele and A.Dot: We are not particularly familiar with either team's starting XI so we are going to go for the place we love the most - Brighton, for the deckchairs and the pier. I love how we have arrived at that prediction using real sporting critique. 0-2

Southampton 0-5 Arsenal
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Adele and A.Dot: This will be a good game. Southampton have played in the EFL Cup in midweek which will not help them. It might be a tight one, but Arsenal are going to win it. 1-2

Millwall 1-0 Watford
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
A.Dot: I think this one is going to be fun for the neutral and there is going to be a red card or three.
Adele: Without a doubt. Just the fact that Millwall's ground is called The Den, that is what Watford are in for - come into the Lions' Den. It feels like Millwall are always up for a match like this.
A.Dot: It might be one of those games where it is really scrappy and there are not that many chances, and someone nicks it 1-0.
Adele: I need to go for a Watford win because I really like (Radio 1 DJ) Chris Stark, who is a Hornets fan, and I feel like he will hate me if I don't back them. I think Watford will put a good show on and win. 0-2
A.Dot: No, Millwall are going to score. It won't be a nice goal, it won't be a pretty goal, it will be a scrappy goal - I can see it now! - but I think Millwall will win 1-0.
Adele's prediction: 0-2
A.Dot's prediction: 1-0

Man Utd 4-0 Wigan Athletic
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
A.Dot: I am a United fan so I would never back against my team, but even as a neutral I would argue that we are winning this one all day.
Adele: I thought you were going to say you want Wigan to win, because it is a really nice story and everyone cried when they won the FA Cup in 2013 - I did - watching little Dave Whelan's face with the cup, he looked so cute.
A.Dot: No, no. It is United. I know it is the FA Cup, and cup ties are not often a walk in the park, but I think this one will be. 3-1
Adele's prediction: Oh Dotty, Dotty - no, no! I was in Wigan the night they had won the cup and it went off. I know that people believe, and I have a feeling they are going to go to Old Trafford and give them a good game. I think you are probably right and United are going to win but I am a Liverpool fan so I can't say that. I am going to go for a 1-1 draw.
A.Dot: In the end we are going to win though, aren't we?
Adele: OK, probably.
