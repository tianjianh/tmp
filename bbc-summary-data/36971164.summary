Championship side Brighton & Hove Albion have signed Northern Ireland international Oliver Norwood from Reading for an undisclosed fee.

The 25-year-old midfielder, who began his career at Manchester United, joins the Seagulls on a three-year deal.
"Oliver is another excellent addition to our squad," Brighton manager Chris Hughton told the club website.
"He had a good grounding at Manchester United and has a wealth of Championship and international level."
He added: "He's a box-to-box midfielder and an excellent passer of the ball, so he gives us extra options in midfield and adds further depth to our squad."
Norwood joined Huddersfield in the summer of 2012 before signing for Reading in August 2014.
He made 92 appearances for the Royals, scoring five goals.
