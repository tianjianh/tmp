[SN]TITLE[SN]
Huddersfield Town 1-1 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Emyr Huws' late deflected strike earned a point for Huddersfield Town against Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder's 25-yard shot took a big deflection which saw it loop over keeper Dorus de Vries and bounce over the line via the crossbar.
Ryan Mendes put Forest ahead in the first half with a fine half-volley.
Forest's Chris Burke struck the post when clean through and Chris O'Grady's follow-up was cleared off the line, moments before the equaliser.
The draw means Dougie Freedman's Forest missed the chance to move into the Championship play-off places and remain mid-table with Chris Powell's Huddersfield.
After a decent start from the hosts, the first real piece of quality from the visitors led to the opening goal.
Cape Verde striker Mendes, on loan from Lille, reached Eric Lichaj's pinpoint header to send the ball high into the net from 12 yards.
Early in the second half, winger Harry Bunn came close to equalising for the hosts but his powerful half volley was headed behind by Kelvin Wilson.
In a game of few clear chances, Burke missed a glorious opportunity to secure victory for Forest when he was sent clear but his chipped effort bounced off the upright.
The rebound fell to on-loan striker O'Grady, but his goal-bound effort was brilliantly scrambled away by Martin Cranie.
With six minutes left, Huws gathered the ball outside the box and fired a crisp shot which struck Jack Hobbs and landed a foot over the line.
