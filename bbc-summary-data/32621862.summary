Election results: Mapping Scotland's dramatic change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A total of 50 of Scotland's 59 seats have changed hands in an unprecedented shift to the SNP at the polls.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party now has 56 MPs while Labour and the Lib Dems have seen their standing slashed to one seat each. The Conservatives retain their single seat.
In 2010, Labour had 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, SNP 6 and the Conservatives just one. Nicola Sturgeon's party has dramatically overturned those figures, taking 40 from Labour and 10 from the Lib Dems.
Labour now holds just Edinburgh South and the Liberal Democrats retain only Orkney & Shetland. The Conservatives keep Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale & Tweeddale.
A change of this magnitude has not been previously seen in Scotland in a single election.
The Conservatives went from being the largest party (by one seat) in 1955 to being electorally wiped out in 1997 but that decline took decades.
Senior figures to lose their seats to the SNP include Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.
Also thrown out by the voters: Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour's deputy leader; and Liberal Democrat John Thurso, a hereditary peer.
Former prime minister Gordon Brown, former chancellor Alistair Darling, and former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell all stood down as MPs at this election. The seats they left have all been won by the SNP.
Twenty-year-old student Mhairi Black is one of 20 SNP female MPs. The party has increased its proportion of women to more than one third.
Number of women in Parliament rises by a third
As with the independence referendum, turnout was very high across Scotland at 71.1%. Two seats have seen turnout rise above 80%, Dunbartonshire East and Renfrewshire East, both SNP gains from Labour.

The new MP is Roger Mullin who took 52.2% of the vote in after a 34.5% swing from Labour to the SNP. Meanwhile, a 15.9% swing from Conservative to Labour suggests tactical voting by Tory supporters.
