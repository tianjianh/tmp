Reports suggest the 27-year-old - a second-half substitute in Palace's 1-0 home loss to West Brom - is set to join Premier League rivals Everton.
"We know there is a big offer and a big club in for him," Pardew told the BBC.
"The deal is close and he will go with my best wishes. There's no medical done or agreement 100% done."
Pardew said Palace would miss Bolasie should he leave.
"It's fair to say we know his heart and soul may be elsewhere," he added.
Bolasie, a DR Congo international who joined the Eagles from Bristol City in 2012, was warmly applauded by the home crowd when he came on in the 66th minute of Saturday's match.
"It was good he put himself up for the game and it showed the love he has for Palace," said Pardew.
