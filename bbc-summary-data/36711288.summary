An enraged Australian man called police after his father burned his prized cannabis plants in a bonfire, reports say.

The father, who lives in the Northern Territory town of Humpty Doo, reportedly set the plants ablaze after repeated disputes with his son.
Police said the son called them as he believed burning the plants was a worse crime than drug possession.
Police said neither man would face any charges.
"Things came to a head yesterday evening and the father allegedly threw all of his son's cannabis plants onto the bonfire and completely destroyed them," Duty Superintendent Jorgensen told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
"This enraged the son, he called us and told us everything basically."
