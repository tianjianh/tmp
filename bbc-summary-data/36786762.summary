Lincoln Red Imps, whose players include a fireman, a policeman and a taxi driver, beat the Scottish Premiership side 1-0 on Tuesday.
The tie will be decided in the second leg at Celtic Park next Wednesday.
Team officials in Lincoln said it would be "wonderful" for the team to visit on their way home from Scotland.
The Gibraltarian team changed its name from the Blue Batons to the Lincoln Red Imps after a former Lincoln director sponsored them.
Lincoln City FC play in the National League and are nicknamed the Imps. Club director Roger Bates said their namesake's victory was "an amazing achievement".
He said: "It is quite an amazing story - I don't think anyone expected it.
"Some people seemed to think we'd beaten Celtic last night, which would have been wonderful, but no, it wasn't us."
He added: "We've had the association for 40 years without coming together, so it would be wonderful if they could pay us a visit."
