Woman blinded in one eye following Clydebank laser attack

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are searching for two teenage boys after one of them shone a laser into a woman's eye in Clydebank, leaving her blind in one eye.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The incident happened as the 33-year-old walked under a railway bridge on Dumbarton Road, near the junction with Cable Depot Road, at about 22:00 on Saturday 10 September.
Both boys were described as being white, aged about 14 or 15 and wearing dark-coloured sportswear.
One of them had brown hair in a quiff.
The woman was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for treatment and later reported the incident to police.
Det Sgt Kevin Mulvenna, of Police Scotland, said: "This was a completely unprovoked and senseless attack on this woman, which has left her blind in one eye. The youths responsible must be caught as soon as possible.
"To point a laser pen at someone is highly irresponsible. Extensive inquiries are ongoing to trace the two boys, with officers carrying out inquiries in the local area and studying CCTV footage to identify them."
He asked anyone with information to contact police.
