[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An ex-radio DJ secretly led a teenage girl from a nightclub to a nearby flat where he raped and sexually assaulted, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ray Teret, 72, first met the alleged victim at Jimmy Savile's Disc Club in Salford before arranging a meeting outside Beat City in Manchester.
Mr Teret, from Altrincham, Manchester, denies more than 30 charges of sex abuse, including 18 counts of rape.
He is on trial with two other men at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
Alan Ledger, 62, also from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, denies a series of assaults.
Also standing trial is William Harper, 65, of Stretford, who denies one count of attempted rape.
The witness, who says she was 15 or 16 at the time of the alleged attack, told the court when Mr Teret asked to meet one afternoon outside the club, formerly known as The Three Fountains, it "was like a secret. He said 'don't tell anybody'".
Nicholas Johnson, defending Mr Teret, said: "Are you suggesting that he swore you to secrecy?"
The witness said: "I am not suggesting that. He said 'don't tell your friends' and I didn't."
Speaking to police in a video interview played to the court, the alleged victim said she had no sexual experience at the time, while Teret was "like some sort of celebrity".
She said at one point Mr Teret, who worked at pirate station Radio Caroline and Manchester's Piccadilly Radio, said to her: "I do things like this to special people."
Mr Johnson said to the witness that "none of the events you describe did happen".
She replied: "I'm not having that. It did happen. He did it.
"I have lived with it for 50 years. That is the truth and that is what happened."
Mr Johnson asked the witness why after the alleged assault she had walked back to the club with Mr Teret.
She said: "Don't ask me, I don't know. I was like a zombie. I was so shocked at what he had done to me."
