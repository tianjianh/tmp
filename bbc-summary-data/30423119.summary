The ex-DJ, a friend of paedophile broadcaster Jimmy Savile, was convicted last week of a series of rapes and indecent assaults.
Teret, 73, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, abused girls aged between 12 and 15 during the 1960s and 1970s.
He will be sentenced on Thursday. Police are now expected to formally investigate these new allegations.
Teret was convicted of seven counts of rape and 11 counts of indecent assault at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court.
He was found not guilty of aiding and abetting Savile in raping a 15-year-old girl in the early 1960s.
But the former Radio Caroline and Signal Radio DJ was found guilty of raping the complainant himself.
During the trial, Teret told jurors he had no interest in underage girls.
But the court heard he had a previous conviction for sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old girl in 1999.
Prosecutors said he had "consistently pursued" young teenage girls.
