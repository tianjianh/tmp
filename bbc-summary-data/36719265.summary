Wimbledon 2016: Nick Kyrgios needs to see a psychologist, says Woodforde

Nick Kyrgios needs to see a psychologist if he is to fulfil his talent, according to six-time Wimbledon doubles champion Mark Woodforde.

The 21-year-old Australian's attitude was questioned after he lost convincingly to Andy Murray in the fourth round at Wimbledon on Monday.
Kyrgios later revealed he played computer games on the morning of the match.
"Some of the choices he is making are quite questionable," said Woodforde.
"Look at his preparation yesterday, getting up and playing computer games. Not what you would expect from a future champion."
Kyrgios has not employed a coach for over a year, but Woodforde said: "Maybe it is not a coach, maybe it is a psychologist or doctor of some sort who can help him with issues because I think it does start off the court with him."
Three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe has also said the world number 18 "doesn't understand" what it takes to become a Grand Slam champion.
The 1987 champion Pat Cash, meanwhile, said Kyrgios needs "some rewiring".
He added: "I don't think he is trying sometimes, there's no doubt about it."
A number of former players have been suggested as a coach for Kyrgios, including 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt, Australia's current Davis Cup captain.
Asked if he would coach his compatriot, Woodforde said it would be a "big no" for him.
"I wouldn't be sitting in the stand being told to stand up and down, clap, and being spoken to in that manner," he added.
