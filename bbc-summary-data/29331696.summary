Kirkcudbright building society staff help foil scam

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have praised building society staff in Kirkcudbright for helping to prevent a woman being conned out of a "substantial" amount of money.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They intervened when she asked to withdraw money to pay for roof repairs after being visited by a bogus workman.
He had driven her to the building society to withdraw the cash.
Staff in the branch did not let her take out the money and contacted a local solicitor who challenged the workman who made off when questioned.
However, the building society employees had already noted down his car registration number and have been able to provide a good description.
Police Scotland and Trading Standards are investigating the incident.
Insp Stuart Wilson said: "This was a tremendous intervention by staff at the building society and it is what we have been asking financial institutions, such as local banks and building societies, to be aware of.
"They spoke with the customer as the pattern of such a large withdrawal was unusual and when they had doubts about the reason for the withdrawal of money they intervened and obtained valuable information which will allow us to investigate the person involved.
"I would advise everybody to be wary of people touting for work.
"Always ask for identification and never let people into your home that you have not asked to attend."
He said anyone with doubts about a caller should contact police on their non-emergency number 101.
"If you are looking for work to be done ask for recommendations from friends or family for workmen they have used," he said.
"Ask for at least three quotes from different firms and have somebody with you when they come to see you.
"Never leave people alone in your home."
