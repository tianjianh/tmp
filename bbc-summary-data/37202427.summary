Barnet were left frustrated after leading Newport County in a League Two match that was abandoned at half-time because of heavy rain.

The visitors led after just 23 seconds through John Akinde, in what was the fastest goal scored in the English Football League this season.
However, it will not count as a goal now.
The Bees also hit the crossbar but will have to start again at 0-0 when the game is eventually replayed.
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It was a good 45 minutes for our team, 1-0 up, who knows what would have happened?
"I don't think it was a good decision [to call the game off], surely you give it 20 minutes?
"There were three puddles, but none of them were bigger than the paddling pool I have got in the garden for my dog.
"The rain was no big deal. There were three little patches and it is a big football pitch. But we respect the referee's decision."
Newport manager Warren Feeney told BBC Radio Wales Sport; "I am disappointed, but I can understand the referee's decision.
"You could quite clearly see the issues with the puddles and the ball getting caught under people's feet.
"The players' safety has got to come first. The referee probably had to look at it and I understand his decision."
