Adeshola Adediwura, 32, Anita Ray, 46, and Lorna Clark, 44, are accused of offences allegedly committed at the Old Deanery care home in Braintree.
They entered not guilty pleas during a hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court, before being bailed by Judge Charles Gratwicke.
The three are scheduled to stand trial on 15 June.
They were arrested following an investigation by the BBC's Panorama programme.
Ms Ray and Ms Adediwura both deny assault by beating and ill-treatment or neglect of a person whose capacity was limited.
Ms Clark pleaded not guilty to putting a person in fear of violence by harassment and ill-treatment or neglect.
The alleged offences date between October 2013 and February this year and relate to one alleged victim.
