A supermarket has introduced a new shopping experience to help people with mental and physical disabilities.

During the weekly "slow shopping" sessions at Sainsbury's in Gosforth, staff have been trained to offer a helping hand.
The store also provides seats and help desks, offers fruit and cake samples, and packs items for customers.
Customer Katherine Vero campaigned for slow shopping after her mother suffered from dementia.
She said: "My mum used to love shopping, but as her dementia developed it became increasingly difficult and stressful for us both.
"When she passed away I wanted to make the experience better for other people.
"I was delighted when Sainsbury's agreed to help me trial it. I hope other retailers will follow."
Lesley Howson is one of those to take advantage of the two-hour sessions on Tuesday afternoons.
She said her autism meant she needed more time to shop.
"I like coming here because the staff are nice", she said.
"They're very understanding and you can take your time."
