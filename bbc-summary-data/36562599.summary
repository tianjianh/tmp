[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leigh Halfpenny will make his long-awaited return when Toulon play Montpellier in the semi-final of the French Top 14 on Saturday.

Full-back Halfpenny has not played since injuring a knee playing for Wales against Italy in September 2015.
Toulon coach Bernard Laporte confirmed the British and Irish Lion will be in the 23 to face Montpellier.
"Yes, I can confirm that Leigh Halfpenny will play," said Laporte on Toulon's Twitter feed.
"He has trained and is ready."
Halfpenny had an operation on a knee injury suffered playing in Wales' final warm-up game, against Italy, before the 2015 World Cup.
The former Cardiff Blues player was scheduled to come back in April before suffering a setback which meant he was not considered for Wales' current tour of New Zealand.
Halfpenny has scored 508 points in 62 Tests, and was man of the series on the Lions' tour of Australia in 2013.
