The UK's largest ferry network operator has reported an increase in the number of cars and passengers carried last year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Caledonian MacBrayne, which runs 26 routes, said it carried 4,653,958 passengers and 1,095,816 cars.
The number of passengers was at a four-year high, while the number of cars was at its highest level since 2009.
Calmac said that its Ardrossan to Brodick service had carried the most passengers (715,048),.
The Wemyss Bay to Rothesay service saw the highest number of cars (147,501).
The route with the lowest carriage was the Mallaig to Lochboisdale run.
However, Calmac added that this new winter-only service also posted the highest percentage increase in the numbers carried.
