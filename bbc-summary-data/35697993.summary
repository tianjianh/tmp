Kevin Sloane was jailed for eight years over the raid at the Martin McColls branch in Newton Mearns in 2011.
He was caught after leaving his photo ID driving licence, a rental agreement, and a mask which had his DNA and the shotgun residue, in the getaway van.
The Scottish Prison Service said the 31-year-old was found dead at Castle Huntly open jail in Perth and Kinross.
A spokesman said: "Next of kin have been informed and a Fatal Accident Inquiry may be held in due course."
Sloane was jailed at the High Court in Edinburgh in July 2012 over the robbery.
The court heard that he and another man were both wearing masks when they targeted the store at 09:00 on 2 November 2011.
The Post Office section was behind a secure glass screen and a locked door.
The lock was blasted off and while Sloan held the gun, the other man grabbed the money from drawers.
Sloane admitted threatening to shoot two people and discharging a shotgun before escaping with Â£5,705 in cash.
The court was told that Sloane, who was from Paisley, Renfrewshire, had agreed to carry out the robbery to clear a drugs debt.
