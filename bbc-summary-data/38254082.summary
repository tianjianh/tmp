Corrie Mckeague, 23, based at RAF Honington in Suffolk, vanished after a night out in Bury St Edmunds on 24 September.
The newly-released images were captured in the town centre between 03:15 and 05:20 that day.
Suffolk Police said they show people who are yet to be traced and could be potential witnesses.
Det Supt Katie Elliott is appealing for those pictured to come forward.
She said: "Officers have trawled through hundreds of hours of CCTV images.
"It is important that we identify everyone who was in the area the night Corrie went missing as someone could, unknowingly, hold a clue that can help us find him.
"It should be stressed that these are just potential witnesses and it's possible they may not be aware that they may be able to assist.
Mr Mckeague's mother, Nicola Urquhart, said she had "no faith" police would find him but Suffolk's Police and Crime Commissioner, Tim Passmore, said the force was doing everything it can.
He said: "Let me make it quite clear, if the reserves are needed to get more resources, they will be used, I will not stop that happening. They will be used to find Corrie.
"It's not just about Suffolk Police, help is coming from far and beyond to try and find Corrie.
"We will keep going on until we find Corrie. We really, really will, I promise you that."
