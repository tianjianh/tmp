Chancellor George Osborne sets date for next Budget

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The 2016 Budget will be held on Wednesday 16 March, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne has told MPs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A week after unveiling his Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne must now prepare for this annual speech outlining fiscal forecasts and tax changes for the following financial year.
Last year there was a Budget on 18 March, the Chancellor's sixth.
However, following the General Election two months later, Mr Osborne held another Budget on 8 July.
This summer Budget was the first all-Tory presentation of Conservative plans to balance the books and raise revenue following the ending of the Coalition government.
On that occasion, the date of the summer Budget was announced in an article for the Sun newspaper, rather than the more conventional statement to Parliament, because MPs were not sitting.
