Hibernian boss Neil Lennon praised his players' professional approach after opening their Scottish Cup defence with a thumping win over Bonnyrigg Rose.

The holders go into Sunday's fifth round draw after routing the junior side 8-1 at Tynecastle.
"We were in a no-win situation, so we have made a good start to our defence of the cup," said Lennon, who took over in the summer.
"The tie was always fraught with danger but I think the fans enjoyed it."
James Keatings and Jason Cummings both hit doubles as Hibs thrashed the East Super League outfit. Andrew Shinnie, Chris Humphrey, Lewis Stevenson and Jordon Forster were also on target.
Rose, who had beaten Dumbarton in a third-round replay, went into the interval 3-1 down after Dean Hoskins converted a penalty.
"We went strong and gave Bonnyrigg the respect they deserved," added Lennon. "They beat Dumbarton in the last round and that's not an easy achievement but I'm very, very pleased with the way we approached the game.
"We got a little bit sloppy just before half-time so I had a few words with them at half-time and we had a really good second half."
Last season's beaten finalists Rangers also progressed to the last 16, coming from behind to beat Motherwell 2-1 at Ibrox.
Kenny Miller grabbed both goals after Louis Moult's 74th-minute header for the visitors and manager Mark Warburton was full of admiration for the veteran striker.
"We see it week in, week out," he said. "It was two quality finishes, a great ball in from Waggy [Martyn Waghorn] and then the composure and the poise from Kenny.
"The second is a great ball in from Emerson [Hyndman] and he finishes it with aplomb so it is no coincidence. It is the way he works on the training field, the way he eats. It is all credit to him and the other senior players.
"I'm delighted we're through. I thought we deserved to win the game but you find yourself 1-0 down with 15 minutes to go so that is the harsh reality of it.
"The positives were we passed the ball well. But we never penetrated, we never tested their keeper and we didn't have enough bravery in the final third.
"All credit to Motherwell - they were very hard working, very well organised and well marshalled. Our goals came late because that is when their players tire. Again two late goals is credit to our team, to their fitness and their desire."
