Aldershot Town 1-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt McClure scored from the spot as Aldershot claimed a vital 1-0 victory over Dover to leapfrog their National League play-off rivals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nick Arnold and Scott Rendell threatened as Aldershot edged the first half, although goalscoring chances proved hard to come by for both sides.
Jake Gallagher was brought down in the box with 17 minutes remaining to give the hosts a chance from the spot and substitute McClure made no mistake to secure the crucial victory.
The hosts, who had Idris Kanu sent off for a second yellow late on, are now a point ahead of sixth-placed Dover but have played a game more.
