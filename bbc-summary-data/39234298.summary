Northumbria Police said the boy was seen driving a blue Renault Clio in South Shields at 10:10 GMT.
A force spokesman said they found the car parked in a lay-by near Temple Park Road and seized it for not having insurance.
In a tweet, the force's roads unit said the boy "denied all knowledge but forgot his books were in the boot".
The spokesman said: "The male teenager has been spoken to by officers and inquiries into the incident are ongoing."
