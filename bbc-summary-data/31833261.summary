Unusual Scottish baby names for 2014 revealed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three baby boys born in Scotland last year were called M, R and T.

The names were revealed as the National Records of Scotland published the forenames of the 56,725 births that were registered in 2014.
The independence referendum may have had an influence on some parents, as two children were named Freedom and another three named Indy.
Some other names featured included Bluebell-Fawn, Nicholas-Darius, Leonidas and Dodge.
In December, it was announced that Jack and Emily were the most popular names for babies registered in Scotland.
Some of the other more unusual names in the 2014 list include Arrlo, Draven, Daiquiri, Emmett, Spartacus and Thor.
Juniper, Jolynn-Diamond, Maddyson-Dyamonds, Thirteena-Starr and Lilias-Anne were also names given to Scots born last year.
Scots mothers were perhaps inspired by the hit TV show Game of Thrones, as Khaleesi was the name given to three girls.
In total 3,359 different forenames for boys were used, while 4,427 different girls names were registered.
