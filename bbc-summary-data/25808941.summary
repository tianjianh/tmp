The actor, who has been in the BBC One soap since 2012, has already filmed his last scenes as Danny Pennant.
A spokesperson for the drama said: "We can confirm that Gary is leaving EastEnders later this year and we wish him all the best for the future."
The actor, who rose to fame in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, went on Twitter to thank his fans.
"Thank you for your messages loved my time @Ee interesting character with lots of scope see u later rather than good bye ;-) ps more 2 come," he wrote.
The Essex actor was responding to fans who were tweeting about his exit from EastEnders but mistakenly included the Twitter handle for telecommunications company EE.
Danny Pennant is a bisexual character who has had relationships with both men and women in the programme.
In December an episode which saw him kiss another male character, Johnny Carter, drew a small number of complaints from viewers.
At the time, EastEnders writer Pete Lawson tweeted: "2014, and gay teens kissing on a soap still draws complaints. Makes me even prouder to have written that ep."
Lucy, 32, featured in the final series of Dancing on Ice.
However, he was knocked out of the ITV competition in the second week.
