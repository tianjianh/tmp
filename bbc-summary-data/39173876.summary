The 26-year-old Scot missed out on a medal by 1.5 seconds after working his way through the elite field in Lahti, Finland.
The race was won by Canadian Alex Harvey in 1:46:28.9.
Russia's Sergey Ustiugov took silver, with Finland's Matti Heikkinen third.
He said: "I am pretty happy, it was a good race, but at the same time I am a little bit disappointed that I didn't have a stronger finish and get onto the podium.
"I have got stronger in every race I have done and I have never done so well in a 50km so it is awesome.
"I have a lot of confidence going into the next World Cup and hopefully I can pull out a few more good races."
It was a tremendous performance by Musgrave, whose previous best result was sixth in a World Cup 15km.
Elsewhere at the 2017 World Championships, he finished 12th in the 15km Classic and 11th in the 30km skiathlon.
