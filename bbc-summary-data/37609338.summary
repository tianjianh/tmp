Marcus Bignot: National League survival would be bigger than promotion for Solihull

Manager Marcus Bignot says if Solihull Moors can avoid relegation from the National League this season, it would eclipse their feat of winning promotion last term.

The Moors, playing at the highest level of non-league football for the first time, are currently nine points clear of the bottom four after 15 games.
"We're on track," the 42-year-old told BBC WM 95.6.
"If we manage to stay up it will be a bigger achievement than last season."
Despite their 2-0 defeat by Aldershot on Saturday, the part-time Moors have a comfortable cushion above the relegation zone, after collecting 19 points so far.
And Bignot says he could not have asked for much more from his squad in that time.
"I didn't tell the players, but I wanted 20 points from the first 15 games and we've got 19," he said.
"I love going up against these full-time and ex-league teams, it challenges me as a manager."
Former Crewe, Bristol Rovers and QPR full-back Bignot has worked without a contract since taking charge at Damsen Park in summer 2011.
He has been pressing to sign terms officially and hopes to finalise a deal following talks with the board this week.
"The club's changing and it has to meet the needs of a professional set-up - we're not far off," Bignot added.
"We're giving players contracts and it comes to a stage now where I have to commit. I'm delighted they want to sit down and talk and see where that goes."
