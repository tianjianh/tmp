Vic and Bob cancelled the first leg of their 25th anniversary UK tour last October because he needed surgery.
Mortimer wrote on Twitter on Monday: "Doctors just passed me fit to do second leg of tour next month."
The dates begin in Leeds on 30 January and continue until 16 February at Hammersmith Apollo in London.
Reeves added on Twitter: "Yes, yes, we're doing it. Here we come. Pull your pants up nice and high."
The tour, 25 Years Of Reeves And Mortimer: The Poignant Moments, was due to have started in Glasgow on 8 November.
They also scrapped shows in Newcastle, Liverpool, Manchester, Blackpool, Birmingham, Cardiff, Sheffield, Bristol, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Sheffield, Ipswich, Nottingham and Brighton.
At the time, Mortimer wrote: "So sorry to those who bought tickets that we had to cancel 1st leg of tour. 3 consultants said I had to have the op immediately."
Reeves told fans at the end of October: "Thank you for all of your messages about Bob. He is doing well. He will return bigger, faster, stronger, better."
The tour is expected to combine elements from TV shows like Shooting Stars and Vic Reeves Big Night Out, with characters such as Man With The Stick, The Stotts and Mulligan and O'Hare.
It will now visit Edinburgh, Newcastle, Manchester, Leicester, Oxford, Ipswich, Southend, Stoke, Cambridge, Nottingham and Brighton as well as Leeds and London.
When the tour was first announced, Mortimer said: "Playing in front of a living audience is where it all began for us.
"I will ensure that Vic arrives at all dates smartly dressed and unarmed. I promise not to mention football, JLS or apricots during the performances.
"Should you choose to attend, be warned - I will be not be wearing a toupee."
