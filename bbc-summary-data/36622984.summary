Euro 2016: Welsh football fans 'confident' for last-16 game

Welsh football fans in Paris have said they are "buzzing" and "confident" ahead of the team's last-16 Euro 2016 tie with Northern Ireland.

The game will kick off at the Parc des Princes at 17:00 BST on Saturday.
Reports have suggested up to 50,000 Welsh fans could flock to Paris, with many heading to the city's 90,000-capacity fan zone.
Fans already there said they are starting to believe the team could go even further.
Thomas Frederick, 30, of Penygraig, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he was feeling "cautious optimism" about the game.
"I think we've earned the right to be favourites [against Northern Ireland]," he said. "I'm buzzing, I can't wait."
Wales finished top of Group B after two wins and a loss. If they win on Saturday, they would face either Hungary or Belgium in a quarter final in Lille on 1 July.
Mr Frederick said he was "secretly" starting to think Wales could even lift the trophy.
"We couldn't have asked for a more favourable draw. To see Spain, England, Italy, France, Germany on the opposite end, I think that breeds confidence in itself," he said.
"Just to know that a passage to the final, if we play to our capabilities, is probably within our targets."
Steffan Griffiths, 24, of the Swansea valleys, is also in Paris ahead of the game and said he was also starting to believe something big was on the horizon.
He said: "Welsh football has had some bad luck over the years... but if we get a bit of luck here we've only got one big team to face and that would be in the final. One game then, who knows?"
Ryan Everson, 32, of Tonypandy, who travelled to Paris after watching Wales' 3-0 win over Russia in Toulouse, was also confident. He predicted a 2-0 win against Northern Ireland.
"It'll be 60-40 in our favour, we'll have more possession, I think," he said.
Antonio Costanza, 28, of Hirwaun, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said he was "very excited" about the match but also nervous.
"I don't like being favourites. I like being underdogs. We've lived with the underdog tag for so many years."
Welsh fans staying in France for the championships awoke on Friday to find the UK had voted to leave the European Union after Thursday's referendum.
Mr Constanza, who was among the majority of Welsh voters who opted to leave, said he was "happy" to receive the news.
"When we're in the EU we can't save the steel industry, because of the quotas that China have with the EU, but also the fishing industry, we've seen that go downhill with the EU," he said.
But fellow Wales fan Paul Jones, 59, of Llandrindod Wells, Powys, said it had been "strange" to receive the news while staying in the French capital.
"I voted to remain in," he said. "I don't think the full truth has come out of the impact of it [a Brexit] will be.
"It's been maybe rushed through. I was a bit 50/50 myself but I thought better the one you know."
And those travelling to France for the knockout stages could find their pounds buy less than before the vote as the currency has seen fluctuations in light of the perceived uncertainty the result has created.
But Mr Jones was more certain about Wales remaining in Euro 2016 after Saturday's game.
"I think we've got a good chance of getting through," he said.
Wales fans with a Follow My Team voucher have been collecting their tickets for the game from the official exchange at Theatre du Chatelet across the city.
Some 5,000 will have to head to the voucher exchange, with fans being told each individual voucher holder must attend with ID to collect their ticket.
The fan zone, situated near the base of the Eiffel Tower, is able to hold 90,000 people - almost double the capacity of the stadium. It has a 420 sqm screen, entertainment and amenities.
Security at the site, located at the Parc du Champ du Mars, is extremely tight, with a perimeter guarded by law enforcement authorities and tight checks and restrictions on items allowed inside.
The fan zone will be open from noon till midnight on Saturday.
