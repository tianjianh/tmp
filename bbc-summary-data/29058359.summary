Liverpool: Fabio Borini included in Premier League squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Striker Fabio Borini has been included in Liverpool's Premier League squad despite his long-term future at the club being seemingly in doubt.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old striker, who spent most of last season on loan at Sunderland, rejected moves to the Black Cats and QPR over the summer.
Clubs submitted a maximum 25-man squad on 3 September, and Tottenham's Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been left out.
Players under the age of 21 are eligible above the limit of 25 players.
Both Liverpool and Manchester City registered 59 under-21 players.
Liverpool accepted an offer from QPR for Borini during Monday's transfer deadline day.
But the Italian rejected the move, later tweeting: "Finally the madness is finished! I protected the MAN and the player that I am today, taking all the responsibility of the situation and for people who didn't want it.
"I'm VERY happy with myself to have taken such an important decision!"
Borini has made 13 Premier League appearances for Liverpool since joining from Roma in July 2012.
Meanwhile, Cameroon international Assou-Ekotto, who spent much of last season on loan at QPR, looks to have an uncertain future at Spurs after he was omitted.
Manchester United pair Marouane Fellaini and Anderson, who were both linked with moves away from Old Trafford, have been included in Louis van Gaal's squad.
Peter Odemwingie was not named in in Stoke's squad, with the striker facing the possibility of being ruled out for the season with a cruciate knee ligament injury.
