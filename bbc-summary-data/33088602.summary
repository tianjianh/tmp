The showjumping event will be held at the Echo Arena from 1-3 January.
Liverpool-born Peter Charles, who won Olympic gold in 2012, said it would be "the hottest event for the world's best showjumpers" ahead of next summer's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Liverpool International Horse Show will also host a "Grand National" of Shetland ponies as well as a range of musical entertainment.
Iain Graham, chief executive of British Showjumping, said that having the event in Liverpool city centre "will bring our sport to a new generation of equestrian fans".
The show is being organised by equestrian promoter Nina Barbour, who manages the Bolesworth International competition in Cheshire.
She said the new Liverpool event was an "Olympic legacy", adding: "I watched the equestrian events in the heart of London at the 2012 Olympics and I wanted to bring that kind of world-class sport to the north-west of England."
The show is expected to attract thousands of visitors and become an annual event.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: "It will be a great start to the New Year and the event will contribute a huge amount to the city's economy."
