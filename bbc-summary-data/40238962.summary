The attack happened near the Water of Leith Walkway at Anderson Place shortly after midnight on Saturday.
Police said the man, who was white and aged between 18 and 24, subjected the woman to a "terrifying ordeal".
He was about 5ft 8in tall, of slim build with short, brown hair, close-cropped at the back and sides. He had dark stubble.
He also had a prominent dark circular earring in one or both ears.
At the time of the attack he was wearing a camouflage patterned hooded jacket, blue jeans and trainers, and had earphones, a rucksack on his back, and a skateboard.
A police spokesman said: "The suspect is thought to have an accent, possibly Irish, although this is not certain, and he seems not to know Edinburgh well."
The woman had been out in the Leith area and was returning home via Bonnington Road and Anderson Place.
The man, who had been walking in the same direction, asked for directions to Ferry Road and then ushered her on to the path leading to the Water of Leith Walkway and attacked her.
After he left, a passing driver stopped to help and contacted police.
Det Ch Insp Martin MacLean said: "This was and remains a terrifying ordeal for this woman.
"I would urge anyone who recognises the description of the suspect, or who was in or around Bonnington Road, Anderson Place or the Water of Leith Walkway at Anderson Place on Friday evening into the early hours of Saturday morning and remembers seeing anything suspicious to contact us immediately.
"The suspect is distinctive as, unusually for that time in the morning, he was seen both on his skateboard and carrying it."
"I also now know that our suspect hailed a black hackney taxi on Ferry Road shortly after the attack at around 00:15 on the Saturday morning, and headed westwards.
"The taxi driver might remember the male carrying his skateboard, and I urge that taxi driver to come forward."
