Colombia's Farc rebels - 50 years of conflict

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One of the world's longest-running insurgencies has ended after nearly four years of negotiations between the Colombian government and the left-wing Farc rebel group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The insurrection has lasted more than 50 years, during which according to the latest official figures 260,000 people were killed and millions displaced.
Farc, or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, was formed in 1964 with the stated intention of overthrowing the government and installing a Marxist regime.
After modest beginnings, the group rose to prominence through the 1980s and 90s as its association with the drugs trade improved its financial standing. At its peak it was the largest and best equipped guerrilla force in Latin America.
