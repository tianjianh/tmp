Daniel Ricciardo: Red Bull driver welcomes head protection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo says Formula 1 drivers will welcome increased head protection in 2017.

Governing body the FIA has told teams it wants to introduce a device called a 'halo', designed to protect drivers' heads from large airborne debris.
"It's not taking away anything from the driver in terms of courage or anything like that," said Australian Ricciardo.
"It's a simple little benefit that we can all gain from and no-one wants to see another fatality."
Frenchman Jules Bianchi died in July 2015, nine months after suffering severe head injuries in a crash at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.
British former F1 driver Justin Wilson died in August after being struck on the helmet by debris from another car during a race in the IndyCar Series in the United States.
The FIA is working with F1 teams to finalise safety plans for next year.
The 'halo' is the FIA's preferred option and would be attached to the car on each side of the rear of the cockpit, with a single strut in front of the driver.
"Our head is the only really vulnerable thing at the moment," added Ricciardo.
"I honestly don't think anyone is against it. Sure, some people probably didn't have an opinion, but most people spoke up about it and said 'it's what we want'.
"With Jules and then Justin, it just seems like a bit of tradition, for what in the end?
"If this is just a little 'halo', within a race or two people will think it looks normal."
Red Bull plan to put forward an alternative concept to the halo which team principal Christian Horner said is more of a canopy design.
"It needs to be tested, which hopefully can be done very quickly," Horner said.
