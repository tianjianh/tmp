[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Team manager Richie Richardson will take charge on an interim basis, starting with Wednesday's one-day international against Bangladesh.
West Indies won nine of 36 Tests under 45-year-old Gibson, who took up the post in February 2010.
Gibson's finest moment as West Indies coach was guiding the team to victory in the ICC World Twenty20 in 2012.
West Indies will play three ODIs, a Twenty20 international and two Test matches against Bangladesh.
"The WICB wishes to express its gratitude to Mr Gibson for his unwavering commitment and professionalism during his tenure as the coach of the West Indies team," said a statement on the West Indies Cricket Board website.
