No sharing platforms

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
While David Cameron and the new London mayor Sadiq Khan were happy to share a stage for the remain cause, it's highly unlikely that any such Conservative Labour tie-up will happen in Wales between now and June 23.

I caught up with the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan in the blazing sunshine on Barry Island this week when he joined the man leading Labour's remain campaign Alan Johnson for an ice-cream and a walkabout.
Rhodri Morgan said: "We all have this terrible fear about what happened to the Scottish Labour party after appearing with Scottish Tories in the independence referendum.
"It was an absolute killer blow then. Wonderful for the SNP, killer for Scottish Labour.
"A fear that is deeply implanted now in every Labour person like me is do not appear on a platform with Tories unless you absolutely have to."
He also had plenty to say on the danger of the referendum campaign appearing to many traditional Labour supporters as a series of internal problems for the Conservative party, or as he put it in reference to the David Cameron versus Boris Johnson dynamic: "This is not about civil war on the playgrounds of Eton."
There is a sense that Labour voters are not appearing as engaged in the campaign as Conservative supporters, a feeling heightened by the dominance of Tories in most of the headlines.
There are clear fears within Labour that this is a danger. Jeremy Corbyn, who has been lukewarm about the EU, will be putting the case to stay in at a rally in Cardiff on Friday.
In the meantime, remain campaigners are continuing to warn of the potential economic dangers of a Brexit.
The latest is a warning from the Centre for Economic and Business Research, commissioned by Britain Stronger in Europe, saying that the potential creation of 6,000 jobs over the next 14 years could be at risk.
Just to be clear, this isn't saying 6,000 jobs would be lost, but instead it's saying that the 6,000 jobs that may be created in the future in the single market would be in doubt.
The problem is that it's saying that jobs could be lost before they are even created.
And it's that point which leave campaigners have latched on to, describing the figures as absurd.
There has been a barrage of economic warnings about a Brexit but relatively few with specific Wales figures.
That could begin to change. I understand that next week leave campaigners will give their projections on the population rise in Wales as a result of EU migration, and the corresponding rise in pressure on the NHS.
And there we have in a nutshell the two focal points from both sides in the debate: the economy for remain and immigration and pressure on public services for leave.
