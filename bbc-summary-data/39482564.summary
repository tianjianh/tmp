It is the only Scottish university to become a government-approved centre of excellence.
It will specialise in developing the latest cyber security techniques.
Cabinet Office Minister Ben Gummer said the research at Edinburgh and other centres, worth Â£1.9bn, would help the country develop the skills to tackle a growing threat.
Mr Gummer, said: "This government is determined to make the UK the safest place in the world to live, work and do business online.
"That is why we need truly ground-breaking research to stay one step ahead of the growing threat of cyber attacks. I am pleased to announce the University of Edinburgh as the latest academic institution to contribute their expertise to this vital field, joining 13 other universities from around the country.
"By engaging with business, industry and academia, we will ensure that we develop the skills and research we need to tackle this growing threat to the UK."
Chris Ensor, deputy director for cyber security skills and growth at the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said: "It's fantastic to see so many leading universities committed to trailblazing improvements to the UK's cyber security research, and it is particularly good to see Scotland represented for the first time."
He added: "At the NCSC, we are absolutely committed to maintaining and improving our already strong reputation as a global leader in cutting-edge research, and look forward to collaborating with these establishments to make the UK the safest place to live and work online.
"These universities conduct world-class cyber security research and this initiative will improve the way academics, government and business work together - benefiting the whole of the country."
Prof David Aspinall, of Edinburgh University's school of informatics, said: "Cyber security and privacy is now an essential aspect of modern life which impacts the technology we see and use, as well as the behind-the-scenes technology we rely on that supports the physical and virtual infrastructures.
"Our recognition as a centre of excellence will bring fresh impetus to our research, to help make the digital world safer for everyone."
