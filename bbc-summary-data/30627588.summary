The body of Lewis Paul Mullan was recovered from the Diglis Basin by search and rescue teams on Saturday.
Officers are trying to trace his last movements and have appealed for witnesses.
"His death is not being treated as suspicious and the coroner has been informed," a West Mercia Police spokesman said.

"Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family at this very sad time," the spokesman added.
