[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Four residents of TV's Benefits Street ran a drugs operation, a jury in Birmingham has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tina Thomas, 47, Charlene Wilson, 31, Samora Roberts, 33, who was known as Black Dee in the Channel 4 show, and Ian Wright, 39, were charged after raids in Birmingham in June 2013.
The four, from James Turner Street, Winson Green, deny charges of conspiracy to supply drugs.
Two other men also deny charges relating to the supply of drugs.
Omari George, 22, of Dora Road, Handsworth, and Marvin Scott, 38, of City Road, Edgbaston, pleaded not guilty to three charges of conspiracy to supply crack cocaine, cannabis and heroin.
The court heard officers raided homes in the street and found "quite significant quantities of drugs".
Ms Roberts and Ms Thomas deny two further charges of illegally having ammunition.
The jury was told officers found a pink shoe containing 13 bullets inside Ms Roberts' home, while in a neighbour's home a sock with her DNA on it was found to contain a further five shells.
Under her bed, officers found a key to a Ford Focus parked in the street, inside which a bag of crack cocaine with a street value of Â£5,000 was recovered.
Samantha Forsyth, opening the case for the prosecution at Birmingham Crown Court, said the street had "gained a degree of publicity because there was a TV programme based on some of the residents."
She said: "The police secretly filmed the defendants going about what we say was their unlawful business: the selling of drugs.
"Each and every one, to a lesser or greater extent, were involved in selling drugs from that street."
When arrested and searched, Ms Roberts had Â£200 in her waistband, and a further two bags of cannabis, the court was told.
The jury heard she told officers: "You didn't even get the guy or four others involved - this makes me laugh".
Roberts denied the drugs were hers while the cash "had come from her grandmother".
Ms Forsyth said Ms Roberts "described her house as an open house, and items such as the car keys" were nothing to do with her.
The car was found to be insured in the name of Ms Roberts' co-accused, Mr George.
The case continues.
