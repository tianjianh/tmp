Anthony Grainger shooting: Officer met PC who shot Mark Duggan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police officer who shot dead an unarmed man met with the officer who shot Mark Duggan before making his full statement, a public inquiry has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anthony Grainger, 36, from Bolton was killed when he was shot in the chest during a Greater Manchester Police operation in Cheshire on 3 March 2012.
He was shot through the windscreen of a stolen Audi in a car park in Culcheth.
The inquiry into his death heard firearms officers involved did not give full statements for six days.
Liverpool Crown Court heard an officer, referred to as W9 to protect his identity, told the court that on 8 March 2012 there had been a meeting with firearm officers involved in the investigation which led to Mr Grainger's shooting death and V53, the officer who fatally shot 29-year-old Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London in 2011.
W9 said it was held to discuss their welfare and post-incident procedure.
Q9 - the officer who shot Mr Grainger - also attended.
W9 told the inquiry he could not recall if  Q9 and V53 went for a private meeting.
Leslie Thomas QC, representing Mr Grainger's family, asked W9 if he thought it "a bit odd"  the man who shot Mark Duggan - came up to Manchester for  a meeting with all the firearms officers in this case.
W9 said: "No, because we'd not been in that situation before.
"He's saying what's happened to him, he's not giving, or he wasn't giving me, advice."
The inquiry heard details of the meeting had only come to light on Tuesday.
W9 told the court some officers were getting a "bit frustrated" at the delay in giving statements.
The inquiry heard the officers were all taken to the same room - which had a flip chart with details about the day on - to write statements on 9 March.
W9 said it only had information such as timings which could have been found on logs.
Q9 a serving officer who had be began giving evidence to the inquiry earlier. He said he had been an authorised firearms officer for six years when Mr Grainger died.
The inquiry continues.
