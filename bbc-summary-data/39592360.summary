Michael O'Halloran will not be in the Rangers squad for Saturday's visit of Partick Thistle, with manager Pedro Caixinha saying an "internal affair" has been "solved".

The 26-year-old winger reportedly failed to show up for an under-20s match on Monday.
"Michael is from our family," said Caixinha. "When I have a problem with my family I sort it at home.
"The only thing I can tell you is he is not part of the next squad."
O'Halloran last featured as a substitute in a 1-1 home draw with Motherwell but has not been involved in the 18-man pools for the subsequent two matches.
"What happens at home stays at home, and it is going to be solved, has been solved, at home," added Caixinha.
