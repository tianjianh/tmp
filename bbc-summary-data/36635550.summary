Brexit deal must be put to assembly, Carwyn Jones says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The people of Wales must be given a say in the final deal that sees the UK leave the European Union, First Minister Carwyn Jones has said.

He said the final settlement should be approved by all four UK parliaments, "without revisiting the result".
Mr Jones will also contact police commissioners after non-British and ethnic minority people were reportedly abused over the weekend.
He blamed "the ugly atmosphere created by elements of the Leave campaign".
Mr Jones led a meeting of his cabinet in Cardiff Bay on Monday, the first since Thursday's referendum result in favour of Brexit.
He said the Welsh Government would use "every lever at our disposal" to protect jobs and communities.
The Â£500m-a-year grant aid to support Welsh farming was "one of the most immediate concerns", and Mr Jones said he had written to the prime minister asking him to confirm that "every penny of this funding is safe", as promised by the Leave camp.
He said there were hundreds of vital EU-funded projects across Wales whose future was "now in the balance" without a funding guarantee.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates would shortly announce measures designed to build confidence in business, the first minister added.
Mr Jones said cabinet members also condemned an "ugly atmosphere" leading to a series of "hateful incidents" over the weekend, against both foreigners and Welsh-born ethnic minorities.
"Such racism is completely unacceptable in Welsh society," the first minister said.
Meanwhile former Welsh Secretary David Jones - who led Vote Leave Cymru - urged Mr Jones to be "gracious in defeat" and ask the pro-Leave Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies to chair an advisory committee of AMs on Brexit negotiations.
The Welsh cabinet meeting took place against a background of Labour turmoil in Westminster.
Jeremy Corbyn faced a front bench revolt on Sunday and Monday as critics attacked his contribution to the Remain campaign.
Rhondda MP Chris Bryant was the first Welsh MP to resign from the opposition front bench in protest.
He was followed by others on Monday, including Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, Pontypridd MP Owen Smith, and the Shadow Welsh Secretary, Llanelli MP Nia Griffith.
Meanwhile, about 100 students marched to the steps of the Senedd in protest at the outcome of the EU referendum results.
Felix Millbank, head of Students for the EU, wants a second referendum and 16 and 17 year olds to be allowed to vote.
Members of the group will meet AMs Jane Hutt and Julie Morgan to discuss what the Welsh Government can do to reassure young people.
The group said it would protest every Monday outside the Senedd until they get a result that benefits them.
Plaid Cymru politicians have disagreed on whether they should work with Labour.
The row came after Plaid's leader Leanne Wood, another Remain campaigner, said she would not rule out a coalition Welsh Government with Labour, after the vote to leave the EU.
Ms Wood said: "We cannot allow Wales to be subsumed by England as the face of the UK changes.
"We now need to have a conversation as a nation, and all options, including independence, need to be considered as part of that conversation."
On Monday, Ms Wood proposed a new union of independent nations.
She said that "redesigning the current UK is the only option", adding: "Wales cannot afford to become a forgotten part of an 'England and Wales' entity."
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, a Leave campaigner, said the UK's Brexit deal may have to be put before the devolved legislatures.
Wales voted 52.5% for Leave, with 47.5% backing Remain.
