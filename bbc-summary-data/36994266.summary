Notts County 1-1 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Stead scored his first goal of the season to salvage a point for Notts County against Stevenage at Meadow Lane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stevenage made a bright start and made the most of a mistake by Haydn Hollis, who should have cleared the ball, but midfielder Jobi McAnuff nipped in to tee up Ben Kennedy.
That goal rattled Notts for a while, but they hauled themselves back level in the 18th minute with a peach of a goal.
A long 50-yard pass by Carl Dickinson picked out the run of Stead who lobbed the advancing Jamie Jones to open his account for the campaign.
Notts then poured forward in the search of further goals and were denied by the woodwork on two occasions.
Stead hit the post when he fired across goal following neat work by Hollis, before Thierry Audel rattled the crossbar from close range.
Both sides tried to fashion chances in the second half, but defences were in no mood to surrender opportunities as both sides settled for a point.
