Micronesia went down to an eye-watering 46-0 defeat against Vanuatu on Tuesday to heap further embarrassment on a team that has now conceded 114 goals in three matches at the Pacific Games.

An opening 30-0 loss to Tahiti set the tone for an inglorious run of results, with a 38-0 demolition at the hands of Fiji following on Sunday.
Micronesia's beleaguered players would have been forgiven for thinking they'd hit rock bottom, but shipping close to a half-century of goals against Vanuatu - a team ranked 200th in the world - marked a new nadir.
Micronesia will at least escape an unwanted place in the record books as they are not affiliated to Fifa and squads at the Pacific Games are comprised of under-23 players as the event doubles as Olympic qualifying.
The official world record remains Australia's 31-0 win over American Samoa in a World Cup qualifier back in 2001.
The Federated States of Micronesia, in the western Pacific, consists of about 600 islands grouped into four states: Kosrae, Pohnpei, Chuuk (Truk) and Yap.
Occupying a very small total land mass, it is scattered over an ocean expanse five times the size of France and has a population of about 100,000.
Though formally independent, in 1986 Micronesia signed a "Compact of Free Association" with the US. Under this, Washington took on responsibility for defence and gained the right to set up military bases and deny other nations access to Micronesia.
