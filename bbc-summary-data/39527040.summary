Reports in the manager's home country - quoting an agent, Federico Pastorello - had suggested he was considering a move, with Inter Milan the most likely destination.
"I'm very happy to stay," Conte said.
"I read this interview about Pastorello. I don't know him and I don't know why this person has spoken about me."
He added: "I worked in Italy. They want to come back for me in Italy. It's normal. I have two more years of contract with Chelsea.
"This is the truth. This is the most important thing. I don't like when I listen to other persons talking about me."
Conte, 47, also addressed speculation linking the Blues with New York City midfielder Andrea Pirlo - who played under Conte at Juventus.
Ray Wilkins, a former Chelsea player and assistant manager, told Talksport he had seen the 37-year-old at Stamford Bridge "on a number of occasions this year".
"He's the one that Antonio Conte would like to come in and replace assistant manager Steve Holland," he added.
But Conte said: "Andrea Pirlo is playing and he wants to continue to play. I don't know why someone wants to put this type of situation for me."
