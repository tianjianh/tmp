[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jack Adcock death: Medics deny boy's manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor called off attempts to save a six-year-old boy because she mistakenly believed he had a "do not resuscitate" order, a trial has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jack Adcock of Glen Parva died after being admitted to Leicester Royal Infirmary with pneumonia in 2011.
Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba, who denies manslaughter due to negligence, had mixed him up with another patient, Nottingham Crown Court was told.
Two nurses also deny charges of manslaughter by gross negligence.
Dr Bawa-Garba, 38, ordered resuscitation to start again a few minutes later after another doctor checked the boy's notes.
The jury was told that the youngster was already beyond the point of no return, but the "remarkable error" showed how he was neglected by Dr Bawa-Garba in February 2011.
Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and died from a cardiac arrest after sepsis was triggered by a bacterial infection about 11 hours later.
The two other hospital workers on trial are Sister Theresa Taylor, 55, and 47-year-old Portuguese-born agency nurse Isabel Amaro.
Prosecutor Andrew Thomas told the jury that the boy's death was caused by serious neglect on the part of the doctor and two nurses.
The medics failed to recognise that a six-year-old boy's body was "shutting down" due to sepsis and close to death, he said.
Mr Thomas claimed the three medical staff failed to recognise the sepsis, which is inflammation caused by infection, and failed to act on it.
He said the staff did not monitor Jack's condition effectively, and failed to recognise high levels of blood gas and lactate.
The case is expected to last up to five weeks.
