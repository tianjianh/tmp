[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts came from two goals down to deny St Johnstone a 100% record in their post-split fixtures on a thrilling final day of the season at Tynecastle.

Saints led 2-0 inside 12 minutes after Liam Craig's opener from the penalty spot and a header from Graham Cummins.
But the hosts were level by the 21st minute, Arnaud Djoum looping a header in before Joe Shaughnessy's own goal.
Hearts had striker Abiola Dauda sent off for a lunge after 57 minutes, but held on as Saints threatened a winner.
Alim Ozturk denied Danny Swanson and Steven MacLean fired wide, before one final chance saw Tam Scobbie's header saved brilliantly by Hamilton.
But the visitors had to settle for remaining unbeaten in their final five matches.
They finished nine points adrift of Hearts in third, but both sides can take satisfaction from excellent seasons.
The Hearts players revealed a banner before kick-off thanking their fans for their "incredible" support during the season, and another full house of 16,046 were treated to a feast of early goals.
Hearts almost had the perfect start when Djoum found space on the edge of the 18-yard box but his shot was deflected wide for a corner.
Saints took the lead in the ninth minute when John Souttar tangled with Cummins in the box from a long throw-in.
Referee Greg Aitken pointed to the spot despite the hosts' protests and Craig fired the ball into the bottom right-hand corner.
Saints doubled their advantage three minutes later as the home defence again failed to cope with a set piece, Cummins meeting a corner from the left on the volley for his eighth goal of the season.
Hearts looked as if they were going to be overrun by Tommy Wright's hungry side but they bounced back quickly when Djoum sent a looping header beyond Alan Mannus into the top corner.
And Robbie Neilson's side were back on level terms four minutes later.
Prince Buaben sent in a cross aimed at top scorer Juanma, but Shaughnessy arrived first and sent a header over his own goalkeeper into the net.
Hearts' players now looked as if they believed in themselves and only the feet of Mannus denied Dauda the lead.
The recalled keeper then made a wonderful save from the same player moments late, diving low to his right to keep his goal intact.
Danny Swanson looked as if he had regained the lead for Saints with an angled shot from close range but a last-gasp clearance from Callum Paterson kept the sides level at the interval.
Saints striker Chris Kane missed a good chance when clean through on goal, clipping the ball over Jack Hamilton but also over the Hearts crossbar.
Challenges were flying in from both teams with referee Aitken struggling to keep control of affairs.
And the home side were reduced to 10 men when Dauda saw red for a thumping challenge on Craig, who was fortunate to avoid a card himself for his reaction.
Only Hamilton in the Hearts goal stood back as the other 21 players on the pitch joined the melee that followed.
Hearts continued to press forward despite being a man down and Alim Ozturk's free-kick brought another wonderful save from Mannus.
But after Ozturk denied Danny Swanson and MacLean fired wide, Saints had one final chance but Tam Scobbie's header was brilliantly saved by Hamilton.
