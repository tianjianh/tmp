It happened at about 00:05 at her house in East Cluden Village in Dumfries.
Police said the woman was woken by the men in her bedroom. One they fled she managed to untie herself and seek help from a neighbour.
She was unharmed but said to be "very distressed". Detectives appealed for information to trace the men who they said "preyed upon a vulnerable lady".
The two suspects were described as white, well spoken, possibly with English accents and aged between 30 and 40.
At the time of the incident their faces were covered and they were wearing dark clothing.
Det Ch InspColin Burnie said: "Although unharmed, this was a very distressing experience for this elderly lady and it is important that we trace the men responsible as soon as possible.
"I would like appeal to anyone who may have any information as to who is responsible. These men need to be apprehended as they have preyed upon a vulnerable lady within her own home.
"I would like to reassure the community that despicable crimes like this are rare and we all must do what we can to trace these men as soon as possible. Any information you may have, no matter however small you feel it is, may make all the difference as part of our broader investigation.
Officers were conducting door-to-door inquiries and had deployed specialist resources, including the dog branch, to assist with the investigation.
