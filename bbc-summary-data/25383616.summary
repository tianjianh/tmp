Hill finished the season ranked number one senior in Great Britain and number five in the world.
She pipped athlete Dina Asher-Smith and golfer Charley Hull, who were also shortlisted for the prize by an expert panel.
"This year has honestly been incredible, and I can't believe I've won out of so many amazing athletes who were nominated," said Hill.
Footballer Wayne Rooney, tennis star Andy Murray and diver Tom Daley are among previous winners on the roll of honour.
Hill played hockey at county level but became a shooting prodigy with her grandfather's help.
Much of her success in 2013 came at the age of 15, including winning a senior World Cup - unheard of for a competitor so young.
The BBC award is given to the outstanding young sportsperson of the year, who was aged 17 or under on 1 January 2013.
A shortlist was created through a combination of nominations made directly to the BBC, and names of young sports people suggested to the Youth Sport Trust by governing bodies.
The list was compiled from the nominations of a panel of judges including Olympic triathletes Alistair and Jonathan Brownlee, 2001 Young Sports Personality winner Amy Spencer, BBC Radio 1's Tina Daheley, Blue Peter and MOTD Kickabout presenter Radzi Chinyanganya and Blue Peter Sport Champion Daniel Allen.
