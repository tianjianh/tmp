Women's Super League One club Birmingham City Ladies have appointed Marc Skinner as their new manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He replaces David Parker, who resigned on Monday after five years in charge.
Skinner had been director of Blues Ladies' centre of excellence since July 2015, having previously filled a number of other coaching roles at the club.
"Over the next year or so, we're going to look to develop a slightly different brand of football," Skinner told the club's YouTube channel.
"Going ahead, it's about getting the team to play the way that I want them to play to bring a bit of excitement to the games and really push forward."
