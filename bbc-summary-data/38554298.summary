[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour support in Wales has reached new lows, an opinion poll has suggested.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A poll by YouGov for ITV Wales and Cardiff University suggests 31% of people would vote for Labour in assembly constituency elections, down three points from September.
That is the lowest rating since YouGov's first Welsh poll in July 2009.
Both Tory and Plaid Cymru support rose by one point to 25% and 21% respectively, UKIP was down one to 12% and the Liberal Democrats up two to 8%.
There was also a dip in support for Labour when respondents were asked how they would vote in a Westminster election, with Labour support falling by two points to 33%.
This is the lowest point in any Welsh poll on Westminster voting intention since a YouGov poll in April 2010, according to Prof Roger Scully.
Conservative support fell by one point to 28%, while Plaid and UKIP support was tied on 13%, with no change in the Plaid rating from September and a slight dip of one point for UKIP.
Support for the Liberal Democrats rose by two points to 9%.
"The saving grace for Welsh Labour continues to be the lack of a single strong opponent," said Prof Scully of Cardiff University.
"While Labour's performance in our new poll is weak, none of their opponents are exactly achieving glittering ratings either," he said.
A Welsh Labour spokeswoman said: "It's heartening that despite the turbulent political year we have faced, Welsh Labour and Carwyn Jones remain the most trusted by the people of Wales.
"We take nothing for granted and as we look ahead to the elections in May and the challenges beyond, Welsh Labour will continue to deliver for people right across Wales."
A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said it was "worth remembering that pollsters failed to anticipate Brexit, Trump's victory, or the General Election result in 2015".
"That's why we remain undistracted from the job at hand, which is to demonstrate that only the Welsh Conservatives, working with colleagues at Westminster, can deliver stability and security, and a Wales that works for everyone."
The poll was of 1,034 adults and  carried out from 3-6 January 2017.
