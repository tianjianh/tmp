The 21-year-old made two appearances for the League Two club, the most recent coming against Southampton's under-21 team on 4 October.
Bransgrove joined the U's in 2013 from Brentford and had loan spells with Bishop's Stortford and Wealdstone.
"It's a big decision, and I've thought about it long and hard with family and friends, but it feels right," he said.
He has previously been called up by Scotland at under-18 and under-21 level.
"I've been doing a part-time Business Management degree with the Open University over the past 18 months and it's been going better than expected," Bransgrove added.
"I've really enjoyed it and I've always had a passion for the accountancy side of business, so I think now is the right time to make that call.
"I know that almost every boy would want to be a professional footballer, but I've always been a footballer because I've been lucky enough to have had that talent."
