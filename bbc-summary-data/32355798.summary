One of a handful of deckchairs recovered from the Titanic has sold for £85,000 at auction in Wiltshire.

The Nantucket wooden chair was on the first class promenade deck of the luxury liner when it sank in 1912.
Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge said he was "delighted" with the sale, which highlighted "one of the rarest types of Titanic collectable".
The chair, which is for decorative use only, came with extensive paperwork to prove its provenance.
Mr Aldridge said: "The sale price reflected not only the importance of the deckchair as a relic from the Titanic but also the ongoing interest in the liner 103 years after her demise"
"The winning bidder is a UK-based collector of iconic pieces of history."
The deckchair was picked up by the crew of the Mackay-Bennett which was sent to recover the bodies of the victims after the Titanic sank.
According to the ship's log records, it was one of six or seven taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Mr Aldridge said it was probably given to French cable ship captain Julien Lemarteleur by a crew member of the Mackay-Bennett, along with the piece of cork from a Titanic lifejacket.
"The in-depth provenance documentation confirms the chain of custody of the deckchair through from Capt Lemarteleur in 1912 through to the present day," he said.
The previous owner, an English Titanic collector, had kept it for 15 years.
About 1,500 people died when the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg on 14 April during its maiden voyage to New York from Southampton.
The auction took place at Henry Aldridge and Son in Devizes.
