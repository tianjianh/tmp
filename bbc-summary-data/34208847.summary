Owners Benson Elliot hope more than 250 jobs will be created at the Fishergate centre in Preston.
The redundant T J Hughes store would be replaced with six modern shop units, a new mall, five restaurants and a cinema.
A planning application will now be submitted to the city council before a public consultation starts on Friday.
