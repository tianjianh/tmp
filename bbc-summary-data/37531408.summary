The 46-year-old has assisted Southgate for the past three years in his role as England Under-21 boss.
Holland will be England first-team coach alongside his Chelsea job.
Leicester assistant coach Craig Shakespeare, who was part of the England set-up, has left in the wake of manager Sam Allardyce's departure.
"The FA will maintain close ties with the highly regarded Leicester City assistant moving forward," read a statement from the Football Association.
Allardyce left his post on Tuesday after being filmed by undercover reporters apparently offering advice on circumventing the Football Association's player ownership rules. He said he was "deeply disappointed" to leave his job, adding that "entrapment has won".
Sammy Lee will continue as England assistant manager with Martyn Margetson remaining as goalkeeping coach.
