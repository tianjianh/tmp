A campaign organised by Victoria Wood's brother to create a statue of the entertainer for her home town of Bury has reached its £20,000 target.

Chris Foote Wood, from Darlington, has run a crowdfunding campaign to erect a life-size sculpture of his sister, who died of cancer in April aged 62.
However he is now seeking a further £10,000 to cast and transport the solid bronze statue and fix it in place.
"Thanks to hundreds of Victoria's fans, we can now pay the sculptor," he said.
"Casting in bronze is an expensive exercise, and there are transport and fixing costs."
Bury Council is providing the site in Library Gardens in Manchester Road and will maintain the sculpture.
Dame Judi Dench has pledged £1,000 to the fund, while an anonymous donor gave £740 on Tuesday to push it over the £20,000 mark.
That donor wrote: "Your sister made me laugh hard from the age of 14 until she left us (a whopping 32 years)... will continue to do so for the remainder of my days. This feels the least I can do in return. Made it!"
Foote Wood is also asking fans to vote on whether the statue depicts her as Bren from Dinnerladies or Kimberley's friend.
Kimberley's friend is currently in the lead with 56% of the vote. It costs £2 to cast a vote and the poll closes at noon on Monday 17 October.
If the full funds can be raised, the statue is expected to be erected by May or June next year.
