Two men suffered serious injuries when their BMW hit railings after fleeing police in Wigston, Leicestershire, in January 2016.
An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation found officers acted appropriately throughout the chase.
The driver who crashed has since been jailed for dangerous driving.
The collision happened about five minutes after the BMW had failed to stop for police in countryside near Wigston.
Two people inside the car were given first aid by officers at the scene.
The IPCC said: "The police constable driving a marked Vauxhall Astra was pursuit trained and the pursuit was suitably authorised.
"Body worn camera footage records the officer updating the control room and assessing the level of risk consistently throughout."
The 21-year-old driver of the car, Lewis Folwell, from Oadby, Leicester, was jailed for 33 months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving without insurance.
He also received a five-year driving ban.
