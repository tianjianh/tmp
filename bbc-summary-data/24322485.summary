A 1,000-tonne bridge which will form part of an elevated tram route through a Nottingham hospital site has been moved into place.

The new steel, bowstring arch bridge was jacked up 6m (20ft) to its installation height earlier in the week and was moved overnight on Saturday.
Part of the A52 in Nottingham was closed while the "feat of engineering" took place.
The Â£570m tram extension should be completed by the end of the year.
Several hundred people turned out to watch the bridge being moved into place near Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre on Saturday night.
Pamela Turner, a resident from Chilwell who came to see the new bridge, said: "It's a fantastic engineering feat - even though I'm not in favour of the tram as it's going to go across the bottom of my garden.
"But nevertheless it's something to see and it's a memorable occasion."
Dr Peter Homa, chief executive of Nottingham University Hospitals Trust, added: "This is a significant milestone and the reality of being the only hospital in the country to link to a tram network is one step closer."
The work to move the bridge, which was inched into place with four, 40-wheel, self-propelled transporters, was completed by 06:00 BST on Sunday.
