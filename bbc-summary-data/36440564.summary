Staff at the Pairi Daiza wildlife park called it a "true miracle", as pandas struggle to reproduce in captivity.
There are fewer than 2,000 pandas alive in the wild, though numbers have increased in the past decade.
The cub, which weighs  just 171g (6oz) and has yet to be named, was described as "a little pink sausage" and let out a healthy squeal immediately after birth.
