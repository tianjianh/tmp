Guardiola said contact has been made about the Germany international but the clubs have not agreed a fee.
Schalke reportedly want Â£45m for the 20-year-old, with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid said to be interested.
"Of course we talk to him - Schalke know we are interested but at this moment we don't have many possibilities to get him," Guardiola said.
Sane, who made his international debut last year, scored eight goals in 33 Bundesliga appearances for Schalke last season.
"There is a difference [in opinion] between Manchester City and Schalke and it is quite big. I do not know what is going to happen but right now he is with Schalke," Guardiola added.
