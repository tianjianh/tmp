The award honours and recognises those who have made an outstanding contribution to broadcast entertainment throughout their careers.
Jean Philip De Tender, of European Broadcasting Union, said Fry represented "all that is best about entertainment broadcasting".
Fry, who previously won a Rose d'Or as host of QI, said he was "honoured".
He tweeted: "*blush* *giggle* *simper* - thank you very much, nice Golden Rose people."
Fry's career took off in the mid-'80s with his comedy show A Bit of Fry and Laurie, alongside House star Hugh Laurie. He went on to establish himself as a household name in series such as Blackadder, Jeeves and Wooster and dramatic adaptations such as Gormenghast. His film career has included Peter's Friends, Wilde and Gosford Park.
More recently he has fronted a number of documentaries, and voices the character of Colonel K in the new series of Danger Mouse. He also played the Master of Laketown in the film adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit.
Fry began hosting BBC game show QI in 2003. Last month he announced he was stepping down from his role fronting the panel show after 13 years. He will be replaced by Sandi Toksvig.
"Stephen Fry represents all that is best about entertainment broadcasting in the UK, throughout Europe and across the globe," said Mr De Tender.
"Not only has he entertained generations and made us laugh, he has also, through his documentary work, shone light on challenging issues such as mental health.
"It's only fitting that the industry will show its appreciation for him in London on December 9th with an award that represents the gold standard."
The Rose d'Or 2015 will present awards next month in six categories for television and online video and five categories for radio.
Paddy O'Connell, who will host the award ceremony, said: "Stephen Fry has tried to remember to be good to people and also that the industry is made up of many, many thousands of people who don't get the credit.
"For me, I'm pleased that someone who has tried to put in the occasional word for the work of others is being honoured in London."
