The money for Kingston Maurward College, near Dorchester, will go towards a £3.24m project that includes a new animal sciences building.
Weymouth College has also been awarded £0.5m towards its £1.5m project to refurbish two buildings.
The grants form part of a £214m investment in 47 colleges in England.
Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said of the Enhanced Renewal Grant that it was to "ensure" investment in "first rate facilities".
Kingston Maurward principal Clare Davison said she was "thrilled" with the grant.
She said the animal science building would include aquatic, reptile and mammal rooms, a laboratory and six teaching classrooms.
She added: "This building will help ensure that we continue to deliver high quality teaching and learning to give young people the appropriate skills required to gain employment in animal science-related fields."
Construction is planned to start this summer and is expected to be completed by mid-summer 2014.
The grants go alongside plans for the government's new skills strategy to "support the majority of good and outstanding colleges" while intervening if colleges are failing.
