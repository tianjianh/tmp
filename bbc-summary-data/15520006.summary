Darcy Austin-Bruce, 20, was visiting an inmate at Wandsworth Prison on 1 May 2009 when he was shot five times, the Old Bailey heard.
Rupert Ross and Leon de St Aubin, both from Fulham, west London, were found guilty of murder.
Ross, 30, disguised himself as a lawyer to gun down the victim while de St Aubin, 34, was the getaway driver.
The jury, which deliberated for 50 hours, was unable to reach a verdict on Khori Hines, 34, of Fulham, and on Casper Smith, 30, of Shepherds Bush. Both men denied the murder.
Ross, who came from a wealthy family and went to private Dulwich College, and de St Aubin, who was a fireman, will be sentenced on Thursday.
During the trial Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said the smartly dressed gunman, who was wearing a crash helmet, and his accomplice escaped on a stolen moped after the attack.
The jury heard Ross, de St Aubin and Mr Austin-Bruce had been friends and were involved in drug dealing but they had fallen out.
Mr Aylett told the court: "To anyone who noticed him, the smartly dressed man must have looked like a lawyer making a legal visit to a client in the prison.
"There was, however, something slightly unusual about the man, in that he was wearing a crash helmet he had not removed from his head.
"This was, in the most literal sense, an inside job. The killers had been tipped off by someone inside the prison."
