One in five older people in Northern Ireland is affected by financial abuse, according to a report by the Commissioner for Older People.

The first study of its kind in NI charts theft, fraud and the misuse of money among crimes committed.
It found that the emotional impact can be devastating, as often the crime is committed by people the victims know including family and friends.
Some 1,025 people, aged 60 and over, took part in the survey.
The report, entitled The Unsettling Truth, found some 7% of those surveyed had experienced abuse. That equates to more than 25,000 men and women, if extrapolated against the total population in Northern Ireland.
According to the testimonies of those polled, there are many different types of financial abuse, ranging from charitable contributions and buying goods, to issues relating to inheritance and coercion.
The survey indicated that incidents were highest in Ards and North Down (32%) and lowest in Causeway Coast and Glens (9%) with Belfast about average at 21%.
The Commissioner for Older People, Eddie Lynch, said he was both shocked and saddened by the findings.
"Aside from the financial loss itself, this crime affects the emotional wellbeing of older people, bringing with it feelings of betrayal, embarrassment and fear," he told BBC News NI.
Questions did not cover phone scams or junk mail, instead focusing on:
Mr Lynch said he had commissioned the report after realising there was widespread confusion around the scale of the problem among professionals, academics and others working in the field.
It is hoped that by increasing awareness of the problem, more people will have the confidence to report it.
Currently, there are about 400,000 elderly people in Northern Ireland, but that figure is estimated to rise to 507,000 by 2026.
