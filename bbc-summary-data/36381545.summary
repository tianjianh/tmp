Giant puppets which drew tens of thousands of people to Liverpool two years ago are set to make a return, the city's mayor has revealed.

The huge figures were paraded through the city in July 2014 in a spectacular display commemorating the centenary of the outbreak of World War One.
Mayor Joe Anderson said the 25ft (7.5m) tall marionettes would return in 2018.
They would form part of a year-long programme of 18 major cultural events, he said.
The celebration - dubbed 'Eighteen for 18' - would mark 10 years since Liverpool was awarded European Capital of Culture status.
It could also see the return of the Tall Ships, Mr Anderson said.
The full 2018 programme will be announced in the autumn.
The event aims to attract up to five million people to the city and generate Â£50m for the local economy.
It will be themed around the end of World War One and organised in collaboration with Wirral Council, he said.
Mr Anderson said the celebration would "make everyone who lives here proud and everyone that doesn't live here wonder why they don't".
