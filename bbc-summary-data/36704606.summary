Oxford have completed the signing of former Plymouth captain Curtis Nelson on a two-year deal.

The 23-year-old centre-back joins the U's after leading Argyle to the League Two play-off final last season.
Nelson turned down a deal to stay at the Devon club after his previous contract had expired and had been the subject of a bid from Barnsley.
"It's a step up in league from last season and Oxford is a huge club," he told BBC Radio Oxford.
Nelson spent seven years at Stoke's academy, finishing his scholarship at Argyle before going on to make more than 200 senior appearances for Plymouth.
"I can't wait to get started at Oxford and I'm looking forward to it," he added. "You've got to pay credit to the manager for what he did last season as they did the job going up automatically.
"They played some really good football and were a difficult team to play against and hopefully it will be the same again next season."
Argyle will be entitled to compensation from the deal, which will be set at a tribunal as Nelson is under 24 and came through the club's academy.
