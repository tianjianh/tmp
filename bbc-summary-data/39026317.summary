Jamie Mines was injured at Kendrick Industrial Estate, Swindon, in December.
The Health and Safety Executive is investigating.
The semi-professional player, from Frome, remains in hospital and said the support he has received has given him a "huge lift".
He thanked well-wishers and donors for their "generosity".
Mr Mines, well-known locally as a player for Frome Town, Radstock, Larkhall and Paulton football clubs, is described as a "goal machine".
His friend Ian Kennedy, who set the fund-raising page up, initially put a target of £20,000, but after Mr Mines' second hand was amputated it was raised to £100,000.
The page has received more than 2,500 donations from across the world.
He said: "The support everyone has shown is admirable, humbling and simply amazing.
"We're not stopping here, this is only the start of Jamie's recovery and this is only the start of our show of support and love for him and his family."
Mr Mines was placed in an induced coma and also had the toes on his remaining foot removed.
Due to the accident he missed his first Christmas with his five-month-old twins Isabella and Savannah.
He is recovering in the intensive care unit at Southmead Hospital in Bristol.
