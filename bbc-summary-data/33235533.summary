Fire broke out at The Unruly Pig on Orford Road in Bromeswell, near Woodbridge, at about 02:15 BST.
Flames spread through the two-storey building, damaging the roof, and also to outbuildings housing a gas cylinder.
The operation was scaled down at about 06:20 BST. No-one was in the building at the time the fire broke out, a Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said.
He said "about 30%" of the building had been destroyed in the blaze.
Station commander Steve Rhind, who arrived at the scene at about 02:30 BST, said officers were "greeted by a fire involving a propane cylinder and... about 20ft to 30ft flames".
"Because of that we took defensive action until the cylinder was safe and then we were able to enter the pub and extinguish the fire."
An aerial appliance will remain to tackle any hotspots in the building, after which fire investigators will take over, he said.
It is thought the blaze broke out "somewhere between the pub and the food preparation area".
"We'll look at the CCTV to ascertain whether this was a deliberate act or accidental," Mr Rhind added.
A notice on the pub's website said: "Dear customers, we are devastated to report that due to a fire in the early hours of this morning, The Unruly Pig is closed for business until further notice."
