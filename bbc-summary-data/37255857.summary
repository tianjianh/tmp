The staff member became entangled with the hydraulically operated machine at the firm's shop in Middlesbrough's Captain Cook Square in December 2013.
The company must also pay £4,800 in costs.
It was sentenced at Teesside Crown Court having pleaded guilty to a health and safety offence at a previous hearing.
Easi Recycling Solutions Limited, which supplied and installed the machine, was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £6,800 costs having also previously admitted its guilt.
Judith Hedgley, Middlesbrough Council's environmental health and trading standards manager, said the woman's "serious crushing injuries" would have been avoided "if better safety procedures, supervision and training had been implemented for the users of the machine".
