[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Giants are giving a trial to ex-St Helens winger Jamie Foster.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old, who can play any role in the backs, began his career with Saints and has made 98 appearances in the Super League.
He also played for Hull FC and Bradford Bulls before switching codes in 2014 to join Hull RUFC as a centre.
The Giants are struggling with injuries after captain Danny Brough and Scott Grix failed to make it through Friday's defeat at St Helens.
