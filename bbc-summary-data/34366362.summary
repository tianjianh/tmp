Striker Taylor met a George Francomb pass to give the hosts a seventh-minute lead from close range.
Francomb was then denied from the penalty spot by Max Crocombe after Michael Nelson's foul on Adebayo Azeez.
Rigg came off the bench to ensure all three points in stoppage time as Barnet pushed forward in search of a leveller.

"I'm proud. It was an ugly game of football. It's hard when they put four up against you. You have to defend resiliently.
"They were tired. It's not an excuse. They were at the end of a long week, but they stuck with it, they defended for their lives.
"And, for the first 25 minutes we were excellent. We got it down, we passed, we moved, we were the footballing team."
Barnet manager Martin Allen told BBC London 94.9:

"It was a disappointing performance. I don't think we really deserved anything.
"After what has been a good week for us, performance wise at Plymouth and last Saturday, we were second best all over the pitch.
"Not very often that I have to say we weren't quite at the races, but we were average."
