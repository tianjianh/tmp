[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lee Jefferies-Jones, 31, stabbed three people in the attack on a street in Yeovil, Somerset, last June.
Jefferies-Jones, who was told he would serve at least 10 years, shouted "I'm going to kill 20 people" as he went on the rampage, Taunton Crown Court heard.
The attacks only stopped when one of his victims overpowered him and held him until police arrived.
Jefferies-Jones, of no fixed address, had already pleaded guilty to one charge of attempted murder, one of wounding with intent and one of attempted wounding at an earlier hearing.
The court heard he was suffering from mental health problems, had a personality disorder and was addicted to drugs when the the attack took place in King Arthur's Drive.
Judge Jamie Tabor QC said Jefferies-Jones was a "danger to the public".
