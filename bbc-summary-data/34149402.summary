Fight to retain Wrexham Maelor Hospital maternity care level

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 40 people against downgrading hospital maternity services in Wrexham have met to discuss the issue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Health officials have suggested withdrawing consultant-led care at one of the region's three district hospitals due to a staffing shortage.
A protest was held in Rhyl this week to defend the unit at nearby Glan Clwyd Hospital with support now growing for the service at Wrexham Maelor Hospital.
The health board said it looked forward to hearing feedback from the meeting.
Bosses, who are still consulting on a range of proposals, including retaining all services, said the quality and safety of maternity services was hugely important.
The other service at risk is at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor.
Prestatyn GP Dr Eamonn Jessup, chairman of the North Wales Local Medical Committee, said: "We have to have three fully staffed maternity and obstetric units in north Wales.
"Any change to that particular system is going to increase risk for mothers and babies."
The meeting is being held at the Catrin Finch Centre at Glyndwr University from 19:00 BST.
