[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Dundee United player cleared of threatening behaviour charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Scotland and Dundee United footballer Garry Kenneth has been cleared of a charge of threatening and abusive behaviour.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Kenneth had denied banging on a door at his Dundee home in December during a row with his girlfriend Reagan Kelbie.
Ms Kelbie told Dundee Sheriff Court during a brief trial that she had not been in a state of "fear or alarm" when Mr Kenneth was at her door.
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC found Mr Kenneth not guilty of the charge.
The 29-year-old was fined Â£300 at a previous court hearing after admitting driving away without insurance after the row last December.
