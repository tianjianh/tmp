Spratt, 25, joins on a one-year deal, and Samson, 23, on a two-year-deal.
Wales international Spratt said: "I'm excited to be joining London Irish. They play an exciting brand of rugby that appeals to me."
Samson, who has played for Scotland at U20 level, said: "I've enjoyed my time at Edinburgh but a chance to play in the Premiership was not to be missed."
The duo will join the Exiles squad this summer for pre-season training.
Jonathan is a strong, powerful runner, with great feet and good distribution skills.
Spratt made his Wales debut in 2009 in a Test against Canada.
The centre also played for Taranaki in New Zealand's domestic rugby tournament, the Air New Zealand Cup in 2008.
He has not played for Ospreys this season, having damaged his anterior cruciate ligament in pre-season, on his return from an earlier injury.
Samson is a product of Newcastle Falcons' academy and has represented Scotland at all age-group levels.
The Edinburgh-born scrum-half featured in the IRB Junior World Championship in 2008 and this season's IRB sevens circuit tournament.
Ross has a strong pass on him, an eye for the gap and he reads the game well.
London Irish head coach Toby Booth said: "Jonathan is a highly talented young player and another very useful addition to our squad.
"He is a strong, powerful runner, with great feet and good distribution skills.
"Ross is an exciting young talent in Scottish rugby. He has a strong pass on him, an eye for the gap and he reads the game well."
