[SN]TITLE[SN]
Zambia FA may face legal conflict over anti-discrimination proposals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Football Association of Zambia (Faz) has proposed changes to its constitution which contradict the country's laws regarding homosexuality.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Zambia forbids homosexuality and can pass a jail sentence of up to 15 years.
But Faz is undertaking a constitutional review aimed at upgrading its statutes to put them in line with football's world governing body Fifa.
Fifa prohibits discrimination against sexual orientation and can suspend or expel offenders from football.
A draft constitution circulated by Faz reads: "Discrimination of any kind against a country, private person or group of people on account of race, skin colour, ethnic, national or social origin, gender, language, religion, political opinion or any other opinion, wealth, birth or any other status, sexual orientation or any other reason is strictly prohibited and punishable by suspension or expulsion."
While that is precisely in line with the statutes of Fifa, should Faz's members adopt the sexual orientation clause it would put the association in conflict with the country's legal constitution.
According to human rights organisation Amnesty, Zambia is one of 35 African nations where homosexuality is illegal.
Faz general secretary Ponga Liwewe played down any potential issues with his association's proposals - despite a widely held conservative view in the country in line with the legal position on homosexuality.
"The draft constitution is in line with Fifa statutes and it is these that are up for discussion," Liwewe said.
"It is the prerogative of Faz members to agree or disagree with the statutes and to make recommendations that will be incorporated in the final document."
Fifa delegate Primo Corvaro conducted a workshop with Faz officials on the constitutional amendments in August whereupon several clauses pertaining to the Fifa statutes were proposed for the new Faz constitution.
But Fifa refused to provide more details when contacted by BBC Sport.
"Fifa is currently working with Faz on the revision of their statutes," said a Fifa spokesperson. "We have no further comment at this stage."
