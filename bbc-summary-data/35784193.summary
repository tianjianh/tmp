Hull FC players asked their coaches to leave the dressing room following Thursday's heavy 46-6 defeat by Widnes.

Head coach Lee Radford said the loss was "the worst" he has seen from the club, where he played more than 200 games before becoming coach in 2013.
"As a group they asked to have five, 10 minutes by themselves," Radford told BBC Radio Humberside.
"They obviously want to air a few grievances and sit down and find out what they want to do."
Radford continued: "Never in my reign have we given in like we did tonight - it's categorically the worst performance since I've been here."

The defeat against Widnes was Hull's third consecutive loss, but it was the manner of the defeat that disappointed Radford.
Hull were 24-6 down at the break and failed to register another point in the match, leaving them seventh in the Super League table.
"I am responsible for tonight, I bear that," Radford said. "I'm looking forward to finding out what's been said (by the players).
"To put in that performance, with as little competitiveness as we did, I am solely responsible for that and I am solely responsible for fixing this up."
