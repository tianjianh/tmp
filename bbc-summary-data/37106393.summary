Burton Albion midfielder Matty Palmer has signed a new two-year contract.

Palmer, 21, has featured in all four of Burton's matches so far this season and has made a total of 110 appearances for the Championship club.
"He's certainly a big part of our plans," boss Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby.
"He was one of those we thought might actually find it better in the Championship with better players around him and a bit more time on the ball."
Palmer, who made his first-team debut for Burton in 2012, was not a first-team regular last season and spent part of the second half of the campaign on loan at Oldham.
"It's been a big turnaround for him. He's only young as well - he's 21 and there's plenty of time," Clough added.
"He's probably our most comfortable player on the ball. He gets moves started up and can play anywhere in midfield.
"He has to be better on the defensive side, but he did some work in the gym in the summer and we've seen the (physical) difference."
