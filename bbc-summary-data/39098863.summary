DUP MP Sammy Wilson has said he agrees with the message of murals in loyalist areas which equate the IRA and Sinn Féin with the so-called Islamic State.

He made the comments on US TV to the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).
PBS asked Mr Wilson what he made of murals comparing the 2015 Paris attacks admitted by ISIS with past IRA attacks.
The DUP MP replied that there "has always been an affiliation between the Irish republicans and terrorist groups, especially in the Middle East".
The Belfast mural shows the aftermath of IRA bombings in London's Hyde Park and Canary Wharf, beside photos of the aftermath of the Paris attacks.
The caption reads: "IRA - Sinn Féin - ISIS, no difference."
Mr Wilson was asked if he agreed with that phrase and he replied: "I do. Yes, of course, I do."
The MP was interviewed by PBS as part of its report on the potential impact of Brexit on the Northern Ireland peace process.
He dismissed arguments that leaving the European Union could be a setback for Stormont.
Mr Wilson told PBS: "I'm fairly sure that at the end of this process we will be wondering 'What was all the fuss about?'"
However, the former Good Friday Agreement talks chair, Senator George Mitchell, has expressed concern that the UK's withdrawal from the EU may limit the scope for co-operation between London and Dublin.
In an interview with Sky News, Senator Mitchell said: "I believe that the European Union was an important factor that led the United Kingdom and Ireland to co-operate in establishing a process that led to the Good Friday Agreement."
He added: "I think the UK being out of the European Union may reduce the prospect for further co-operation."
