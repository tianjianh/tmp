Vehicles are being routed down Flatgate in Howden following the closure of the A614 last week when a sink hole opened up near a railway bridge.
Resident Hannah Pears recorded footage of videos driving on the pavement close to the front of her house.
East Riding of Yorkshire Council said it was trying to alleviate the problem.

Ms Pears said she was "terrified" about the safety of her two-year-old son.
"My house is situated directly onto the footpath, I don't have a garden or a driveway," she said.
"Some days I can't get out of my house safely and I have to wait to be able to leave it until the traffic has subsided."
Eddie Holt, owner of a local haulage firm, claimed the diversion had not been properly considered causing large lorries to "try and squeeze through".
"There's no weight restrictions, no width restrictions, they are sending everything down the narrow streets," he said.
He added: "I can imagine some of the younger people pushing prams out the front door, pushchairs with kids in, it's quite horrific what could be coming."
In a statement, East Riding council said: "Following the emergency situation that has arisen on the A614 at Howden, a diversionary route including use of the M62 and other major roads in the area is being progressed as quickly as possible , but this is dependent on Highways England and Network Rail.
"We as a council are working hard to support Network Rail to alleviate the situation for residents of  Howden and motorists in the area."
Network Rail said a collapsed water tunnel had led to the sink hole which caused the closure of the A614.
The company said it was working to repair the road and it expected it "will be fully rebuilt in around five weeks."
