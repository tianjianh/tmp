Traws Link Cymru will film the 56-mile (90km) route between the two rail stations, with a camera on a microlight aircraft, to make a promotional video.
A report for ministers on reopening the line, which shut in 1965, is due to be published in the autumn and could lead to a feasibility study.
Traws Link Cymru hopes a 90 minute service can be established.
It hopes to reopen stations at Pencader/Llandysul, Llanybydder, Lampeter, Tregaron and Llanilar.
Fifty years ago the journey took nearly three hours, stopping at 20 stations.
Group chairman Adrian Kendon said: "Even after almost two years of rigorous campaigning and despite overwhelming support from politicians and the public alike, some people still believe that reopening the line will be impossible because of redevelopment.
"Less than 3% of the old line has been lost and we want to prove to everyone just how clear it is and show just how breathtakingly beautiful the Aberystwyth-Carmarthen line was."
Traws Link Cymru has estimated the cost of reopening the line as being around Â£500m.
