Historic bridge near Melrose closed for checks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 250-year-old Borders bridge near Melrose is to shut for five days for checks ahead of major repairs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The B-listed Lowood Bridge over the River Tweed is to close between 09:00 and 16:00 from Monday to Friday.
Motorists travelling between Galashiels and Melrose on the B6374 road will have to divert via the Melrose bypass.
It will allow the first phase of a Â£640,000 repairs programme to get under way later this year with work set to be completed by 2019.
