[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A girl who died as a result of anorexia could have survived if she had been admitted to hospital sooner, an inquest has been told.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emma Carpenter, 17, of Nottingham, had been treated at a unit for teenagers with eating disorders before her death in hospital, on 22 December 2006.
When the teenager was referred she weighed about four stone (25kg) and had a body mass index (BMI) of 10.
According to the NHS, an ideal BMI for an adult is between 18.5 and 24.9.
Emma died of organ failure 10 days after being admitted to the intensive care unit at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham.
Dr Timothy Bowling, a consultant gastroenterologist at Nottingham Universities Hospital Trust, told the coroner that if Emma had been referred to hospital when her BMI was 12 she would have survived.
The inquest also heard how the alcoholism of Emma's mother was "inextricably linked" to the girl's condition.
Glyn Flowerdew, Emma's grandfather, told the court that the teenager had lived with him and his wife for about a year before her death because her mother was an alcoholic and showed signs of suicidal behaviour.
Questions over the identity of his granddaughter's biological father had also caused concern, Dr Flowerdew said.
The inquest at Nottingham Coroner's Court is expected to last two weeks.
