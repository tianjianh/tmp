Jamie Lawson: Man of lucky breaks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
If there's one ingredient singer-songwriter Jamie Lawson isn't lacking, it's patience. He released his first album 12 years ago, tirelessly gigging ever since.

It was a run-in with Ed Sheeran and a series of subsequent fortunate events that eventually led the now 39-year-old to become the first signing to Sheeran's new record label, Gingerbread Man Records, thrusting him into the international spotlight.
As his now number one single suggests, he explains how he "Wasn't Expecting That".
Yes, you could say that! Especially on the scale that it's on, which is quite huge. When you're put in front of the world by one of the biggest stars in the world at the moment, then you're going to get some attention. It's definitely a life changer.
Pretty much. There's only been one point where I got a 'proper job' when I was living in Dublin. I worked in a record store but I realised I didn't want that. I still wanted to pursue a career - or a life - that my songs provided for me. Then about four years ago, Wasn't Expecting That became a hit in Ireland.
They love their storytelling songs and their singer-songwriters. There's a big singer-songwriter scene, which is one of the reasons I moved there. They took Wasn't Expecting That completely to heart and it took off but it just never got out of Ireland, which was quite strange. It just stayed there. I didn't make it swim.
Yes, now it's flying everywhere because of Ed Sheeran.
We met in London at a gig venue called The Bedford in Balham. He was obviously very talented and he liked what I did so we swapped numbers but we lost touch pretty much straight away.
Then he released his first album and then his second and became a huge star. About a year ago I got a text out of the blue saying that Ed was doing a secret show in Dublin and he wanted me to open up for him.
I asked him why he asked for me and he said he'd been over in Ireland for his cousin's wedding and they were out in a bar and he saw my poster.
It's crazy really. He said that he listened to Wasn't Expecting That a lot, particularly when he was making his song Afire Love. It helped him get the tone right for the song.
Ed invited me out on the European and UK tour that he was doing which was incredible. Over that time he said he was thinking of starting a record label and he thought I should be the first act.
Well he said that when he was drunk so I assumed he was joking. But it turned out he wasn't. He sent me a text the next day and all it said was: 'No, I'm serious.' It took me a while to get my head around the fact that he wasn't joking.
He told me that nobody could make a Jamie Lawson album better than Jamie Lawson so he really left me to my own devices to make the record I wanted to make. He put me in touch with a producer who he had been working with and we went through the songs to pick which should be on the album. That was his involvement really.
It's pretty simple acoustic-based music. Folk music but not in the traditional sense. Hopefully it's just a very warm and inviting record that you can step into and not feel too stressed about.
I wanted to create an open, spacious album because I find a lot of music quite claustrophobic at the moment. The songs that play on the radio - everything is massively compressed - and the beat of it all is quite insistent and incessant. I wanted to step back from that.
His main ethos is work as hard as you can, and be nice to everyone. I try and take that on board.
Right now I'm about to re-join One Direction on their UK tour, which is quite surreal and amazing.
I was a little apprehensive going into it, thinking they wouldn't get it, but the response has been overwhelmingly positive. I'm with them for the rest of October and then my album comes out. I'm doing my own tour of the UK and Europe in November and then I go back to the States in December. Next year I'll be on the road with Vance Joy in the US.
Jamie Lawson's eponymous album is out 16 October.
