Bank: Traffic banned to improve safety at dangerous junction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Traffic is set to be banned from a busy road junction in the City as part of safety measures.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
From Monday, only buses and cyclists will be allowed at Bank Junction from 07:00 to 19:00.
City of London Corporation say the scheme will see a 50-60% reduction in casualties and improved air quality.
The changes were voted through by the Corporation after 34 cyclists and 31 pedestrians were injured there between 2011 and 2015.
In 2015, Ying Tao, a 26-year-old female cyclist, was killed when she was hit by a lorry turning at the junction.
Following her death a protest was held at the junction, and months later more than 13,000 people signed a petition calling for lorries to be banned during rush-hour.
During the 18-month trial, vehicles will be rerouted around the junction and it will be enforced with automatic number plate recognition cameras.
New taxi ranks have been added and existing ones extended.
