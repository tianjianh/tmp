Trainer fans who camped out for four days have finally got their hands on a pair of limited edition Kanye West sneakers.

The devoted "sneakerheads" spent Â£150 on each pair of Adidas Yeezy Boost trainers but some were expected to re-sell them for up to Â£500.
The camp was set up outside Nottingham's 18Montrose shop, the only one to release them without a raffle.
The shop said it sold out of its 90 pairs in just more than an hour.
The fans brought tents, chairs and sleeping bags for the four-day wait.
Ben Rutter, 17, who had travelled from Manchester with friends to get his place in the queue, said: "We've been out here for a day or something.  It's been all right - I've got a high body temperature."
Up to 200 shoppers were queuing outside the shop on Saturday morning for a chance to purchase the mainly black footwear.
One sneaker fan, Ammo, 19, from London said: "I come from London and it is quite hectic there when it comes to releases like this so we have to leave London to get a chance to get them in-store.
"Otherwise we have to sign up to a raffle for a chance to get one."
Zaheed, from Birmingham, said: "I think there are only about 19,000 pairs released worldwide so obviously everybody is going to try to come and pick up their first pair."
