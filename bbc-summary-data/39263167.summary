[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jon Parkin inspired York to a breathtaking 5-3 win against rock-bottom Southport which involved the lead changing hands three times.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Minstermen went ahead in the fourth minute when Aidan Connolly slipped the ball to Sean Newton who skipped past a couple of defenders and fired home from 15 yards via a deflection.
However, the Sandgrounders surged in front with two goals inside a minute. First, Louis Almond left Shaun Rooney for dead near the corner flag and then curled home a brilliant 19th-minute equaliser.
Moments later, the visitors turned the game on its head with an even better goal as Rory McKeown let fly with a 30-yard rocket which found Kyle Letheren's top right-hand corner.
Almond then stretched the visitors' lead in the 41st minute with his second spectacular goal, turning sharply before rifling home a dipping 25-yard shot over Letheren.
However, City were given hope in first-half stoppage time when Parkin's lofted cross was headed in by Vadaine Oliver from a couple of yards out.
York deservedly equalised in the 64th minute when Parkin chested down Amari Morgan-Smith's cross and volleyed home from eight yards.
Parkin later turned provider for Morgan-Smith to score past the advancing Craig King eight minutes later.
Oliver then hit the post before City made the points safe in the 78th minute following a long throw from substitute Sam Muggleton, making his debut, which Parkin simply headed in from eight yards.
