Scottish Challenge Cup: Celtic's colts drawn to face Livingston

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic Under-20s will travel to face League One's Livingston in the third round of the Scottish Challenge Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are the only survivors after Premiership colt teams were introduced to the competition this season.
Highland League survivors Turriff Utd host Hibernian, whose Championship rivals, Dundee Utd, entertain last season's beaten finalists, Peterhead.
Two other League One sides, Albion Rovers and Brechin City, host St Mirren and Dunfermline Athletic respectively.
Championship teams enter the competition at the third-round stage and three others have home ties, while three more are away from home.
Ayr United, Queen of the South and Falkirk entertain Airdrieonians and Stenhousemuir, both of League One, and League Two's Elgin City respectively.
Dumbarton face a trip south to play Stranraer, whose League One rivals, Queen's Park host Greenock Morton, while Raith Rovers travel to take on Forfar Athletic of League Two.
The 12 winners will be joined by two sides each from the Welsh Premier League and Northern Ireland Football League in the last 16 of the new-style competition.
Four teams each from the Highland League and Lowland League had started the competition, but only Turriff survive after having knocked out Montrose in the second round.
Montrose's League Two rivals, Cowdenbeath, were 2-1 victims of Celtic's youths, one of 12 colt sides who began the competition from top-flight clubs.
