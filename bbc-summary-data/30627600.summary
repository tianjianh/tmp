Carlton Fairweather: Sunderland Ladies name new head coach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sunderland Ladies have named academy boss Carlton Fairweather as their new head coach.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 53-year-old former Wimbledon and Carlisle midfielder joined the club's coaching staff in 2003.
The club will play in the Women's Super League in 2015 after winning promotion, and the WSL2 title, in October.
Mick Mulhern stepped down in November after six-and-a-half years as boss as he could not commit to coaching full-time as well as being a police officer.
Mulhern rejoined the club in May 2008 after a previous stint in charge.
Having begun his playing career in non-league football, Fairweather became a member of Wimbledon's famed Crazy Gang in the 1980s, and made 138 league appearances for the club before a brief spell with Carlisle preceded a move overseas.
