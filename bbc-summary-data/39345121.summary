The 23-year-old Connacht player featured in Ireland's opening two Six Nations matches, in Scotland and Italy, but has been sidelined since.
Dillane has had a successful operation and now faces a race to be fit.
Ireland take on the USA on 10 June before Tests against Japan on 17 June and 24 June.
It is a trip where boss Joe Schmidt will be keen to test the depth of his squad.
"Ultan Dillane underwent successful surgery on his shoulder and will be unavailable for the remainder of the season," Connacht said on Tuesday.
