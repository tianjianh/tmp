School transport charges for students with special educational needs are being considered by Derbyshire County Council.

The Labour-led authority said the proposals were part of a number of cuts aimed at combating a budget shortfall of £157m over the next four years.
A range of pupils, from pre-school age to young adults could be asked to pay up to £349 a year.
The move would save the authority £191,500.
Councillor Kevin Gillott, cabinet member for children and younger adults, said: "I know that at a time when families are struggling with rising costs and falling living standards people will be wondering why we are having to consider asking them to pay towards providing transport for their children.
"Sadly, we have no choice  as we're being forced by the government to make savings that mean the council will have to cut the amount of money it spends on providing services to Derbyshire families by a third."
The authority is also looking to reduce its housing-related support budget by £9m.
This would affect a range of groups, including people with learning disabilities and those at risk of domestic abuse.
The county council said it would begin its consultation on Monday.
