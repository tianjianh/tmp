The 31-year-old centre, who has 22 caps, is in his fifth season at Bayonne after joining them from Toulon in 2012.
"Gaby's comfortable playing 12 or 13," said director of rugby Dai Young. "That gives us more options, particularly during the international period.
"He's got really explosive power onto the ball, and the pace, agility and footwork to beat defenders."
Lovobalavu will cover the departure of Samoan international Alapati Leiua, who is moving to Bristol, and former Scotland centre Nick De Luca, who has already announced his intention to retire from professional rugby at the end of the season.
