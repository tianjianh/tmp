[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jenny Laing has replaced Barney Crockett as leader of the Labour group, and hopes to be confirmed as the authority's new leader on Wednesday.
She told BBC Scotland: "I am delighted and privileged that my colleagues have had faith in me. We had a democratic process. Barney has done a great job over the last five years."
Mr Crockett was unavailable for comment.
The new Labour group leader said the decision was taken at their annual general meeting.
She added: "I hope I will be confirmed as the new leader of Aberdeen City Council."
The council has made headlines in recent months.
Last month, claims that Aberdeen City Council's administration broke the rules by including a pro-Better Together letter to council tax payers were thrown out by an independent watchdog.
Bills sent to every council tax payer in Aberdeen included a letter from Mr Crockett.
In March, Mr Crockett insisted Scottish government ministers would not be banned from visiting Aberdeen City Council buildings.
His intervention came after Labour colleague Willie Young sparked controversy with the suggestion.
Last week the authority announced that Angela Scott will become its new chief executive.
She will take up the post in July, replacing Valerie Watts who is leaving to take up an NHS post.
