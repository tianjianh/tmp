[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
One construction worker has been killed and another was hurt after a building in New York City partially collapsed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The eight-story building in midtown Manhattan is being demolished to make way for a high-end hotel.
The incident happened about 10:30 local time (14:30 GMT), sending dozens of firefighters and emergency workers to the scene.
It is unclear what caused the collapse. The scaffolding and netting on the front of the building were undisturbed.
A 27-story, 170-room luxury hotel is planned for the site.
