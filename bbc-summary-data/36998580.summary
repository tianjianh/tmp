There have also been reports that X-ray machines were turned off to speed up waiting times for spectators.
But organisers said they have increased security staff at checkpoints and the lines were back to normal.
"We apologise to all spectators who have had to queue on the first day of competition," read a statement.
"We requested that the relevant authorities increase the speed and effectiveness that people can enter the park by requesting that more employees are working on the X-ray machines."
