The hosts took the lead when David Smith's low ball across the six-yard box was tapped in by Andy Stirling.
But Hardie, who had earlier curled wide, levelled before the break when he nodded in Tom Walsh's cross.
Substitute Calum Gallagher could have sealed St Mirren's first win of the season but his shot was well kept out by Alan Martin.
