It is the second serious injury in 2016 for the 2010 Olympic downhill champion.
The 32-year-old broke her leg in March while leading the Alpine skiing World Cup and missed the rest of the season.
"While I am beyond frustrated by this latest setback, at least my knees are ok," Vonn said in a post on her Facebook page on Friday.
The four-time overall World Cup champion added: "I had successful surgery last night in Vail and everyone took great care of me."
Vonn says she will return to action "as soon as possible".
