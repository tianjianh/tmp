Eoin O'Mahony, now 32, had two operations at Cork University Hospital in 2001 after complaining of headaches during his final year at school.
Days later, he lapsed into a coma-like state and now has locked-in syndrome.
His family took a case against the Health Service Executive (HSE), seeking a settlement to cover his future care.
Liability had already been conceded in the case, according to the Irish broadcaster, RTÉ.
Friday's hearing was the latest in the family's long-running court battle with the Irish state to secure funds to meet Mr O'Mahony's extensive healthcare needs.
Dublin's High Court was told his disability is so extreme that he cannot even use his finger to press a button if he needs help.
"No financial award can bring back Eoin and his family to a life of fullness and achievement he had every reason to aspire to," the judge said.
Over the last five years, Mr O'Mahony has already received interim payments totalling 4.1m euros (£2.8m) to cover his care needs.
But after 13 years of litigation, his parents asked for the case to be finalised with a lump sum payment that would meet the cost of their son's future care requirements.
The judge said the case had been "enormously long" and complex.
He added that he intends to award Mr O'Mahony a final settlement of at least 10m euros when he makes a final ruling on the case in October.
