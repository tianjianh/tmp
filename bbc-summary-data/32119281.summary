Conwy man Harry Price's organs save five lives

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
While it is now three years since Harry Price died, his organs have since saved five lives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Conwy man signed the Organ Donor Register in the 1980s after a friend died in a motoring accident.
When he died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage in 2012, his wife Glenys said this decision made a very traumatic time slightly easier.
In December, Wales will be the first UK country to introduce a soft opt-out system for organ and tissue donation.
This system of deemed consent means that if you have not opted out, you will be regarded as having no objection to being an organ donor.
Mrs Price, 71, said that even though her husband's death at the age of 74 was "a complete shock", they had discussed organ donation and it was something that was important to them.
She said that knowing Harry's life was giving life to others made things slightly more bearable, adding: "The person who received his liver was able to give their daughter away at her wedding."
Mrs Price said she was "touched" to receive an Order of St John Award on her husband's behalf, which recognised the gift of life he had given.
Ahead of deemed consent becoming law, the Organ Donation Wales Time to Talk public awareness campaign has been launched, encouraging people to discuss their organ donation wishes with their loved ones.
