Ex-defender Pemberton, 51, played with former England and Arsenal forward Wright while at Crystal Palace.
Abraham, 18, scored his 10th goal of the season on Saturday in City's 4-0 win at Fulham.
"Tammy is very much like Ian Wright with regard to being in the right place at the right time," said Pemberton.
"Ian Wright could create something out of nothing and Tammy is the same with regards to goalscoring.
"He's frightening and he just has this knack of getting there when you think he can't do it, and that is something Wrighty had as well," he told BBC Points West.
Abraham is expected to shake off a dead leg picked up over the weekend to feature against Leeds United on Tuesday.
The Chelsea loanee has helped filled the void left by Jonathan Kodjia, who joined Aston Villa for an initial Â£11m.
"He is like a sponge, he wants to take everything on board," said Pemberton. "Losing Kodjia has not hurt us as much as we thought it may do and at the moment we feel we might have the better deal."
