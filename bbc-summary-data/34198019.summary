A tryst between Bethan Thomas and head Graham Daniels came to light after a pupil filmed outside the door at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg in Bryn Tawe and posted it online.
Both teachers resigned from their jobs.
A fitness to practice hearing of the Education Workforce Council in Cardiff ruled their conduct was unprofessional, calling it "reckless", and struck them off for three years.
"These were serious allegations which impact on public confidence in the profession," said panel chairwoman Jacquie Turnbull.
"Their conduct was so serious that it is fundamentally incompatible with that of a registered person. It was an abuse of their position of trust. Their behaviour was reckless."
They will not be allowed to apply to re-register for three years.
Mr Daniels told the hearing that he deeply regretted his actions, adding: "It is something I am completely ashamed of."
Former deputy head and chemistry teacher Miss Thomas said: "My behaviour fell short of the standards expected."
A 34-second video clip, containing "sexual noises" coming from the headmaster's office, was posted on YouTube.
The disciplinary panel ruled that the pair had taken part in a sexual act in a school office, that they exposed pupils to the behaviour which was recorded by a pupil and uploaded to social media sites and that they took part in sexual acts or inappropriate behaviour on school premises between May 2013 and April 2014 which was witnessed by another member of staff.
Heini Gruffydd, the chairman of governors, told the hearing he considered both teachers to be outstanding.
He said the governors welcomed their decisions to resign from their posts, but felt they both could have a future in teaching.
Heather Lewis, the head teacher of Ysgol y Strade in Llanelli, told the hearing that she has employed Miss Thomas on a temporary basis since 2014.
She added that the governing body would like to consider offering her a permanent position pending the outcome of this hearing.
