Police were searching for ecstasy pills following the deaths of three men in Suffolk and one in Shropshire.
Tests showed the pills contained PMMA, which was being linked to the deaths of two men in Ipswich and possibly with the other two.
Officers will be out in Ipswich this weekend highlighting the dangers.
The ecstasy pills were red, triangular and embossed with the Superman "S" logo.
A batch of 400 similar ecstasy pills was found in a public place off Norwich Road in Ipswich on Sunday and tests showed they contained PMMA, which police said made them more dangerous.
Supt Louisa Pepper said: "Our number one priority is to prevent other people suffering the tragic consequences of this dangerous drug.
"We successfully seized a large quantity of drugs, but there may still be some out there so if you do come across them please don't take them, and if possible hand them over to us."
The two men who died in Ipswich have been named locally as Justas Ropas, 22, and Gediminas Kulokas, 24.
The deaths of John Hocking, 20, from Rendlesham in Suffolk, and a 27-year-old from Telford, have been "potentially" linked to the drugs.
Ms Pepper, from Suffolk Police, said: "We're urging anyone who has tablets matching this description not to take them or pass them on, and to hand them in to us or one of the agencies listed."
A 28-year-old man has been charged with being concerned in the supply of ecstasy over the Telford death.
A 19-year-old from Ipswich has been charged with being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs (ecstasy) and possession with intent to supply a Class B drug.
