Walking programme 'had no impact'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A walking programme which was designed to get people with intellectual disabilities fit had no real impact, according to a study.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The University of Glasgow researchers found that participants in the Scottish government-funded Walk Well programme were not walking more or sitting less.
They said participants had difficulties finding time to walk with carers, which may be due to social care budget cuts.
They said more intensive or home-based programmes may be required in future.
Dr Craig Melville, senior lecturer in learning disabilities psychiatry, said: "Cuts in social care budgets have disproportionately impacted on disabled people and even when social care support is available, it is often not funded at a level that allows paid carers to support adults with intellectual disabilities to be physically active."
According to the study, only 5% of adults with intellectual disabilities meet public health recommendations for physical activity, compared to 64% of adults in the general population. About 50% were classed as obese, compared to a national average of 25%.
The Walk Well intervention programme was designed for adults with intellectual difficulties to increase their levels of physical activity and reduce the time they spend sitting.
The programme was funded by the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish government.
It consisted of three face-to-face physical activity consultations, which included behaviour change techniques, written resources for patients and carers, and an individualised structured walking programme.
Researchers carrying out the review selected 102 participants at random - 54 took part in the Walk Well programme and 48 were on a waiting list.
Over a 12-week period, both groups took fewer than 5,000 steps per day and 59% had a BMI in the obesity range.
A majority of participants lived in the most deprived neighbourhoods of Scotland.
Dr Melville said: "The lack of effect in the Walk Well trial may be due to a lack of availability of social support to make walking accessible, facilitate community participation and moderate social disadvantages."
He also suggested that social enterprises, volunteer organisations and buddy programmes might have a role to play in supporting adults with intellectual disabilities to be more active.
A Scottish government spokesman said: "The Scottish government is committed to improving the lives of people with learning disabilities, and we acknowledge this report.
"We want people with learning disabilities to enjoy a healthy life. Reducing the stark health inequalities people with learning disabilities face is a key priority within our 'the keys to life' strategy."
