Mark Docherty was sent off for blocking John Baird's attempt with his hand and the striker scored from the spot.
Danny Rogers produced a smart save to deny Christian Nade and Kevin Cawley put the rebound just wide.
However, Nade was brought down by Rogers and Garry Fleming converted the second spot-kick of the match.
