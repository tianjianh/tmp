Emma-Lee Wray, from Carnlough, an A-level student at Ballymena Academy, has been a cadet for five years.
She will be walking by the Queen's side on Thursday at the official birthday party in Windsor Castle.
Emma-Lee is representing Northern Ireland and will be joined by cadets from other UK regions.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Emma-Lee said she had been selected after participating in a Duke of Edinburgh residential.
"There were cadets from England, Scotland and Wales, and we did some adventure training.
"The officials said they saw me excel, but it was so close to April Fool's Day that I thought they were joking!
"I'm still in shock."
Emma-Lee has not yet been given a full list of details about her role during the celebrations, but she believes it will be a "wonderful day".
A special ceremonial style uniform has been custom-made for Emma-Lee to wear during the event.
Debbie-Lee Wray, Emma-Lee's mum, said she is "extremely proud" of her daughter's achievements.
