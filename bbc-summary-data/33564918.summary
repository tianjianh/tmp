UK Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has said Alistair Carmichael should get a second chance.

Mr Farron said there was no need for the Orkney and Shetland MP to step down or contest a by-election.
Mr Carmichael has been under pressure since admitting leaking a memo about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
An SNP MP has said Mr Farron should show respect for the current parliamentary investigation and court action into Mr Carmichael's actions.
Mr Farron said Mr Carmichael, Scotland's only Lib Dem MP, had made a "fulsome apology".
Mr Carmichael, who was Scottish secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before May's election, initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph but has since admitted being responsible.
The article, which was published in the newspaper on 4 April, at the start of the general election campaign, contained details of a private meeting between Ms Sturgeon and the French ambassador Sylvie Bermann.
It claimed the SNP leader would prefer to see Tory leader David Cameron become prime minister rather than his Labour opponent Ed Miliband.
Both Ms Sturgeon and the ambassador denied the account and Mr Carmichael accepted, after the election campaign, that the "details of the account are not correct".
Mr Carmichael will appear before a special electoral court in September after a legal challenge to his election was lodged by a group of constituents under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Mr Farron told BBC Scotland: "Most decent people, and most people are decent, think people deserve a second chance.
"Alistair has made a very fulsome apology and I think most decent people in Scotland, in Orkney and Shetland in particular, think 'fair enough, give the guy a break'.
"If a handful of people want to pursue it, that is their right but I think it speaks more about them than they would want it to be said."
The Liberal Democrat leaders comments have been criticised by SNP MP Peter Grant.
"Mr Farron claims that most people want to move on and give Mr Carmichael 'a second chance'. However, the fact remains that Mr Carmichael contested the election in May on false pretences, claiming that he knew nothing of the dirty tricks campaign against Nicola Sturgeon when it was in fact orchestrated from his own ministerial office.
"There is an investigation into Mr Carmichael's conduct by Westminster's Standards Commissioner, and of course the election court hearing has still to take place - the decent thing would be for Mr Farron to show some respect for these important processes as they take their course."
