Liam Gallagher: Beady Eye have split up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liam Gallagher has announced that his band Beady Eye is no more.

He posted the news on Twitter, thanking fans for their support, but offered no reason why they were splitting.
The band formed in 2009 and was made up of former Oasis members Gem Archer, Andy Bell and drummer Chris Sharrock.
They released two albums: 2011's Different Gear, Still Speeding and 2013's BE but neither replicated Oasis' immense success.
Both albums did reach the Top 5 in the UK's Official Album Chart but the band only had one UK Top 40 single, The Roller.
In February 2014, the band cancelled an appearance at the Coachella festival.
Later that month, it was announced that they'd parted ways with their manager Scott Rodger.
In a statement to NME at the time, Rodger said that Beady Eye were one of the "last great British rock bands".
There has been nothing from the band since that period and today Gallagher's tweet seems to confirm that Beady Eye's relatively short-lived time is over.
