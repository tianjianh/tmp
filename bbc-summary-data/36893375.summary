The picture shows John Thomson, James Nesbitt, Fay Ripley, Hermione Norris and Robert Bathurst in character as they prepare to return to the show.
Filming for the eight-part series has been taking place in Manchester.
Creator Mike Bullen said it was the right time to revisit the group of friends "as they tip-toe through the minefield of middle age".
The original series, following the lives of Adam, Pete, Jenny, Karen and David, lasted for 33 episodes and was last seen on television more than 10 years ago.
It will be returning to ITV later this year.
