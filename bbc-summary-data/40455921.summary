Simon Grayson's wider experience of the English game makes him a better choice as Sunderland manager than previous target Derek McInnes, says ex-Black Cats winger Kevin Kilbane.

Grayson, 47, joined Sunderland on Thursday from Preston North End, another of Kilbane's former clubs.
Earlier in June, Aberdeen boss McInnes turned down the job after talks.
"If you look the track records of both managers, Grayson is a much better appointment," Kilbane said.
The former Republic of Ireland international added to BBC Newcastle: "Grayson has knowledge of the English leagues and a wealth of experience.
"It is nothing against Derek McInnes. He may go on to excel.
"It may be something Sunderland regret but, going on past performances, I believe Grayson is head and shoulders above McInnes."
Kilbane says Grayson "will fit perfectly into what Sunderland supporters want from a manager", comparing him to Peter Reid, who Kilbane played under at the Stadium of Light.
"His track record is excellent. He has got a lot of experience and is very much what you see is what you get," Kilbane said.
"Peter Reid was very much in that mould. He will say it as he sees it and that might upset people but, in general, people will respect him for his views.
"I have total admiration for what he has achieved."
Grayson replaces David Moyes, who resigned in May following the club's relegation from the Premier League.
The club's search for a new manager was put on hold by potential takeover talks, which were called off on Thursday.
"With the appointment coming so late and the lack of time he has got to invest in the squad, time is against him," Kilbane said.
"Sunderland fans might not want to hear it but it might be that this is a season of stabilisation.
"We might not see the best of Sunderland in August, September and October. Maybe in December and January he will have had time to get his ideas across."
Former Preston player Kilbane added. "After growing up a Preston fan I felt this season was time for Grayson and Preston to kick on and seriously challenge for the play-offs and hopefully for promotion.
"There is a tinge of sadness but I am a realist. I am sure Preston realise that it is a great opportunity for Grayson."
