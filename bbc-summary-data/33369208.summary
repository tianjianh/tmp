BBC Wales has warned that plans to cut 1,000 jobs across the corporation  will "inevitably impact" its operation.

BBC Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies said there were "no easy answers" to questions over how many jobs were at risk.
It follows the announcement by director general Tony Hall of plans to save £50m a year.
The number of job cuts in Wales are not expected to be confirmed until the autumn.
Most job losses are likely to affect managerial roles, as well as the BBC's support teams including HR, marketing, finance, project management and business affairs.
Mr Davies said: "This is obviously tough news and I'm not going to pretend there are any easy answers.
"The additional savings targets announced today by Tony Hall are very challenging and will inevitably impact on important teams that do vital work at the heart of BBC Wales.
"But the financial context for the BBC is clear and we will sit down with the affected teams and the unions to work out the best way forward.
"By looking for savings outside programming areas, the BBC will do everything possible to minimise the impact of the changes on the output and services we deliver to audiences."
Lord Hall said the BBC was facing "difficult choices" due to the financial climate.
Any new savings will need to be delivered alongside the existing BBC savings plan - Delivering Quality First - which has already seen BBC Wales cut more than 100 posts and reduce its budget by £10m since 2012.
While the majority of cuts at BBC Wales have affected support areas, management and overheads, the BBC's investment in English language programming for Wales has fallen 32% - or £10m - in real terms over the past eight years.
