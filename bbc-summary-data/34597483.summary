The blaze broke out at the Carrickmines halting site in the Republic of Ireland on 10 October.
It is understood it started at a pre-fabricated building and spread quickly to a nearby unit.
Surviving families will be sheltered at Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown council park.
Willie Lynch and Tara Gilbert,  their daughters Kelsey and Jodie, Thomas and Sylvia Connors and their children Jim, Christy and six-month-old Mary died.
Jimmy Lynch, 39, a brother of Willie, also died in the blaze.
The blaze is not being treated as suspicious.
On Tuesday, a message of sympathy from Pope Francis was read at a funeral Mass for five of those who died.
