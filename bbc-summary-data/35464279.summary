The  discovery was made just before 14:00 GMT on Friday on land close to Imperial Park, Coedkernew.
In the video, Lucy, a member of the team investigating, said she was "really worried" for the mother.
She added: "I know you cared for the baby because you wrapped your little one in a towel."
She asked the mother to call or text her or get a relative to do so.
A post mortem examination carried out on Monday showed the baby had been born at around full-term, police confirmed.
Gwent Police is currently treating the death as unexplained.
Anyone with information has been asked to call 101.
