US Election 2016: Asia markets bounce back after Trump win

Asian share markets have bounced back after seeing a sharp sell-off on Wednesday in the immediate aftermath of Donald Trump's US election victory.

Thursday's rally followed rises in Europe and the US, as the market meltdown many had anticipated failed to materialise.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index soared more than 5.5% in early trade clawing back losses from the previous session.
Australia's ASX index added 3% with other markets also opening higher.
Traders had expected Hillary Clinton to beat Mr Trump to become the next US president.
His victory initially sent money flowing into safe haven stocks, gold and currencies including the yen.
But despite the Asia market slide on Wednesday, the major US markets all rallied robustly during the day and closed more than 1% higher.
The Dow Jones ended the day up by 1.4% at 18,589.69. The S&P 500 was 1.11% higher at 2,163.26 and the Nasdaq was also up by 1.11% at 5,251.07.
In London the FTSE 100 index dropped 2% at the start of trading before recovering to end the day 1% up.
France's Cac index and Germany's Dax both closed about 1.5% higher after erasing losses of more than 2%.
Some analysts had likened the shock of a Trump victory to the Brexit result earlier this year. But neither markets nor currencies have swung as wildly as they did after June's EU referendum.
Kathleen Brooks, an analyst at City Index, said markets were calming down after the initial shock. "This suggests that a win for President Trump is not yet America's Brexit moment."
She suggested Mr Trump's acceptance speech, in which he called for the country to unite, helped to settle some of the market jitters.
