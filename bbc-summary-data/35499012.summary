The draft document cites links between terrorist attacks and humanitarian intake, the ABC reports.
The proposed reforms include a simplified visa framework  to create "stronger controls over access to permanent residency and citizenship".
Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he had not seen the document.
"Assuming it's genuine, ideally these things do not get leaked, but it happens from time to time," Mr Turnbull said on Friday.
Immigration Minister Peter Dutton also said he had not read the document.
"Government departments produce draft documents for consideration all the time. This is a draft document which has not been seen by the Minister or his staff - nothing more," a spokesperson for the Minister said in a statement.
The draft document also reportedly proposed a revamped citizenship test and pledge, constant assessment of refugees and a framework to consider migrants' suitability for life in Australia.
