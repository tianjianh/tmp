Padarn Bus, which operated routes from Bangor, Caernarfon, Llanberis and to Beaumaris on Anglesey, ceased its services overnight with 84 job losses.
There was some disruption after Friday's announcement with council officers trying to find new providers.
They are hopeful Padarn Bus drivers can be recruited by alternative operators contracted to cover the work.
Gwynedd council is trying to provide companies to take on all affected routes in the county.
"We are not leaving any community with no services at all," said Gwynedd council senior transport manager Dafydd Williams.
He said the council had identified firms which could help but that one issue was that some did not have enough staff to cover the services so it was possible drivers employed at Padarn Bus could find work.
Affected routes on Anglesey will now be provided by Arriva Buses Wales, Gwynfor Coaches and O R Jones Llanfaethlu.
Padarn Bus's sudden announcement came a day after a man, aged 44, and a women, 28 were arrested following allegations of fraud at the company.
On Saturday, Gwynedd council confirmed school transport would run as normal on Monday as children return from their half term holiday.
Deiniolen councillor Elfed Wyn Williams, who is a regular user of buses to Bangor and Caernarfon, said: "I feel for the workers as well.
"The council are looking for replacements but their priority is that children get to school."
Llanberis councillor Trefor Edwards said: "It's better to have some services than nothing at all."
He said the village's main bus services to Bangor and Caernarfon would be covered and he was hopeful routes covering outlying communities like Llanrug would also be protected.
Gwynedd council has published revised timetables but says some of the services formerly provided by Padarn Bus around Bethesda, Maesgeirchen, Glasinfryn, and Gerlan among others will not be covered directly.
The Snowdon Sherpa services have been revised but will continue their circuits around Snowdonia's most popular destinations.
A spokesperson for Snowdonia National Park Authority said the organisation was "very happy that Gwynedd council has taken the initiative and the lead to ensure that this important service will continue".
Hywel Williams, MP for Caernarfon, described the bus services as vital links in rural communities.
"For some of the outlying villages they [bus services] are social services to allow people to get to work," he said.
