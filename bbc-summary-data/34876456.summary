[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The DNA of an Indian woman, who was stranded in Pakistan for a decade before returning home last month, does not match a family claiming to be hers.

India's foreign ministry confirmed to BBC Hindi that Geeta's DNA samples did not match that of the Mahato family.
After arriving in Delhi, Geeta said the Mahatos, whom she had identified in photos, were not her family.
Geeta, who has speech and hearing impairments, was about 11 when she was believed to have strayed into Pakistan.
Her plight emerged following a Bollywood film Bajrangi Bhaijaan, which told the story of a Pakistani girl who cannot speak and is trapped in India.
Apart from the Mahato family from the eastern state of Bihar, at least two other families have claimed her as their own.
Geeta has been lodged at a shelter home where she will remain until her family is traced, officials say.
On Geeta's arrival in Delhi, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj said: "Whether or not her parents are found, Geeta is our daughter. I thank Pakistan from the core of my heart for looking after her for so long."
