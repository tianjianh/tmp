Bolton closed in on the top two in League One with a derby win over Rochdale at the Macron Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Portuguese midfielder Filipe Morais was credited with the 82nd-minute winner, with defender Mark Beevers also in the mix as Bolton scrapped to get the ball over the line.
Rochdale, now without a goal in 474 minutes, claimed the close-range attempt had not crossed the line but referee Chris Kavanagh ignored the protests.
Bolton enjoyed the best of a low-grade first half but it still took them 34 minutes to muster a worthwhile goal attempt.
Then, in quick succession, Gary Madine and Liam Trotter forced Joseph Rafferty and Mark Kitching to clear off the line.
The visitors' lack of recent fire-power was only too evident and it took them until nearly half-time to win their first corner.
Bolton, who lost injured wing-back Andrew Taylor before the break, then survived two scares of their own as Dale committed more men into attack.
Ollie Rathbone drilled one effort narrowly wide before keeper Ben Alnwick denied skipper Ian Henderson from close range.
But the game was heading for a stalemate until Wanderers struck to earn a first league win over their neighbours since 1973.
