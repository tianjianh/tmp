Snoop told fans during a visit to Manchester, ahead a concert at the city's Apollo, that he had asked his agent to negotiate him a role.
Snoop, who has followed the soap for 11 years, believed that Granada TV producers had responded with interest.
A spokeswoman for Granada said: "He's obviously a great character but hard to see how he'd fit into Weatherfield."
She said they had yet to receive an approach from the performer, whose real name is Calvin Broadus.
He said: "I had my agent reach out to them to see if they could try to get me on and they said they were interested so hopefully it might happen.
"It would be perfect for me to be on the show.
"I love the whole dynamic, the way it is put together, it is my world, it is something I could fall into."
The 38-year-old recorded a video message to mark the show's 50th birthday earlier this year.
While in Greater Manchester, the rapper also visited Salford's Ordsall Community Centre, where he played football with young volunteers.
The teenagers had given up their time to paint the centre in exchange for tickets to his Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube concert.
