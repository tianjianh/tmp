Danny Brough's late drop-goal secured Huddersfield Giants' Super League survival and condemned Hull KR to the Million Pound Game to stay up.

Giants led 22-4 at the break after Ryan Brierley crossed twice and Leroy Cudjoe and Aaron Murphy also scored, after Maurice Blair's 16th-minute Rovers try.
The hosts fought back through Ken Sio, Mitch Allgood and Iain Thornley after the break to draw level at 22-22.
But Brough's drop-goal edged Giants back in front with six minutes to play.
Terry Campese hit the post with a late drop-goal attempt, as Rovers tried to draw level, knowing a draw would have been enough to secure their own survival.
The hosts then crossed for what would have been a dramatic late try but, following a video referral, Campese was adjudged to have pushed a Giants player.
Giants - who won the League Leaders' Shield in 2013 - can look forward to another season in Super League, while Rovers' 10-season stay in the top flight remains under threat.
Hull KR will play either Salford Red Devils or London Broncos in the Million Pound Game on Saturday, 1 October at the KC Lightstream Stadium.
Hull KR interim head coach James Webster: "How you think you can win a game doing that when the other team completes at 90% is madness, absolute madness.
"We spoke in the week about not pushing any passes but that's what we did. We put ourselves in a really poor position.
"I'm really proud that we came back from it but we gave ourselves too much to do.
"We need to pick ourselves up and prepare well for Salford or London. It's big game, there's no hiding from that."

Huddersfield coach Rick Stone: "It wasn't pretty in the second half and our management could have been better but we showed plenty of tenacity when we needed it.
"It was a tough ask to come here and win. We got away to a decent lead and with the breeze they fought back.
"It wasn't textbook at the end but the result was the only thing that mattered."
