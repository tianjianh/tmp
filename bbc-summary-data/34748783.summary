[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A girl was offered a loaded gun before it was fired accidentally causing her an injury, her mother has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The seven-year-old suffered a minor lip injury when a bullet casing from the assault rifle hit her after it was shot into the ground at Nottinghamshire Police headquarters last year.
The officer, who has not been named, has been taken off firearms duties following an incompetency hearing.
The officer said he did not remember the weapon being offered to the girl.
Her mother told the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) her daughter was offered the gun for a photograph shortly before it was fired.

The IPCC, which has released a report into the incident, asked the officer about the mother's allegation to which he said it was "not something I recall specifically".
He went on to say: "that's not to say that it maybe didn't happen, it's certainly something I don't recall".
The girl, from Worksop, was on a tour of the force's headquarters in Hucknall with a group of youngsters, aged six to 13, and their parents, in October.
She suffered a burn to her lip when she was hit in the face after the gun, a Heckler & Koch G36C assault rifle, was fired.
Derrick Campbell, from the IPCC, said: "The seriousness of this matter cannot be underestimated. It is through good fortune that no one was more seriously injured.
"The officer's actions, while not deliberate, posed a genuine risk to those present."
Following the investigation, the IPCC concluded that operational firearms officers must keep their weapons loaded and therefore should not be involved in community events.
It also criticised Nottinghamshire Police for not having a policy in place regarding firearms at public events or carrying out a risk assessment before the display.
Another officer, involved in the incident, has since left the firearms department while a third has been recommended to undergo further training.
