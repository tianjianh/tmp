The body of Una Crown, 86, was found stabbed and burned at her Magazine Lane home in Wisbech on 13 January 2013.
A police spokesman said although the investigation had been "full and thorough", new detectives from the major crime unit would review the case.
Officers will spend the week in Wisbech appealing for fresh leads in the case.
Mrs Crown was last seen alive on 11 January 2013 but had spoken to a friend by telephone at about 17:00 GMT the following day.
Mrs Crown's body was discovered in the hallway of her bungalow by her niece's husband, John Payne, when he went to collect her for a day out on the morning of 13 January.
Despite numerous appeals, the case remains unsolved.
New detectives from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit have now been brought in to take over the investigation.
Det Ch Insp Sharn Basra said: "The investigation into the murder of Una Crown has never closed, but the decision has now been taken to review the case.
"While the investigation to date has been full and thorough, with a number of significant lines of inquiry established, no-one has been charged.
"It is hoped reinvestigating the circumstances surrounding the murder may identify additional witnesses and information adding further weight to the evidence already gathered."
A Â£10,000 Crimestoppers reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for Mrs Crown's murder.
