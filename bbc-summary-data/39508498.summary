[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City's owners have bought Uruguayan side Atletico Torque.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The club play in the Second Division of the Uruguayan league and have had two top-six finishes in two years.
The City Football Group already owns clubs in Australia, Japan and the United States and the purchase of Atletico Torque is seen as a way of increasing scouting in South America.
City have also entered a collaboration agreement with Atletico Venezuela of the Primera Division of Venezuela.
CFG chief executive Ferran Soriano said: "We are pleased to take this next step in our football development operations.
"The investment in CA Torque enables our organization to build on existing connectivity in Uruguay and helps to expand the options for identifying and developing local and South American talent.
"This move also provides us with an administrative hub for our pre-existing scouting operations in the region and provides a footprint for City Football Group in South America."
CFG owns MLS outfit New York City, A League Melbourne City, and J League Yokohama F Marinos.
