Kyle Lowry scored 24 points while DeMar DeRozan added 13 points and 11 rebounds as the Raptors recorded their fourth straight win in the NBA.
It was the sixth regular season game to be held in London in as many years.
Arsenal's Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Olivier Giroud, ex-Chelsea star Didier Drogba and chef Gordon Ramsey were among the star-studded crowd.
Orlando rallied from double digit deficits on three occasions with Victor Oladipo tying the game in the fourth quarter with 0.7 seconds remaining.
But despite the best efforts of Oladipo, who top scored with 27 points, Toronto won in overtime as the Magic lost for the the sixth time in seven games.
