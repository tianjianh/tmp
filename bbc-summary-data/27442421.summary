[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former health board chief has been appointed the new head of the NHS in Wales.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Liverpool-born Andrew Goodall has worked in the NHS for 23 years and is the ex-chief executive of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board.
He succeeds David Sissling, who was appointed chief executive of Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust earlier this year.
Dr Goodall said he was privileged to have been offered the post.
The Welsh government said Dr Goodall had worked in Wales for most of his life, having moved to the country at a young age.
He has a law degree from Essex University and a Ph.D in health service management from Cardiff Business School.
He became Aneurin Bevan University Health Board's chief executive in June 2009, and has led a number of national programmes and initiatives. Most recently he has supported a ministerial review into the handling of complaints which is due to report shortly.
He said: "I, of course, understand the pressures and expectations that the NHS faces, but also know that we have the responsibility and opportunity to make the necessary changes, including how we balance delivering our services with focusing on improving the long-term health of the Welsh population."
Dr Goodall will head the Welsh government's Department for Health and Social Services in addition to being chief executive of NHS Wales.
