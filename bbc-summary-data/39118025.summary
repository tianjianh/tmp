A lorry driver responsible for a steam engine falling from a low-loader and crashing into a bus has pleaded guilty to six counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Philip Last, 53, of Great Yarmouth, was at the wheel of the lorry when it crashed in West Mersea, Essex, on 23 September 2015.
In total, 23 people were injured.
At Ipswich Crown Court, Judge David Goodin told Last his "negligence" had "grave consequences".

They made no comment after the hearing, which was adjourned until 22 March for reports.
