[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arsenal Ladies winger Jordan Nobbs scored one and set up the other to help her side defeat Notts County Ladies in Women's Super League One.

Danielle van de Donk finished when Nobbs' sublime pass put her in one-on-one to give the Gunners an early lead.
Nobbs then curled home Dominique Janssen's perfectly-weighted pass at the end of a well-worked team move.
Notts could have reduced the arrears when Jess Clarke headed Jo Potter's cross wide as Arsenal held on.
Arsenal Ladies boss Pedro Martinez Losa:
"I'm very happy with that display. The team was consistent and solid all over the park and that is great credit to us because against Notts County we know how difficult it can be.
"There's no question about the importance of Jordan Nobbs and what level she can get to. We know her quality and because of how young she is she brings a lot of energy to the team.
"Day by day we'll grow as a team and I'm sure we'll be up the top end sooner or later, but we've got some momentum with us now."
Notts County Ladies boss Rick Passmoor:
"It's massively frustrating because on our side of things over the last two weeks with our results and what we've done in training it hasn't transferred over to the pitch today.
"The result, and the three points, go to Arsenal fully justified. But for ourselves we need to get back out there on Monday and sort things out.
"It's hugely important time in the season with lots of games in quick succession and this is where it's won and lost."
