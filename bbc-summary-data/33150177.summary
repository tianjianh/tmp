The club said it would be inviting Danny Simpson to contribute to an internal hearing this week.
The 28-year-old former Manchester United player avoided jail after he was found guilty of the attack.
He was ordered to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work at Manchester Magistrates' Court on Monday.
Simpson was arrested on 29 December after police had been called to reports of a row at a house in Worsley, Greater Manchester.
During his trial, he had denied trying to strangle his ex-girlfriend and mother of his child, Stephanie Ward.
Ms Ward later withdrew her statement and did not support the prosecution.
On Tuesday, the Foxes said they had now noted Simpson's sentence.
A statement read: "Now that legal proceedings have concluded, Danny will be invited to contribute to an internal hearing in the coming days where the extent of any club disciplinary measures will be determined."
Simpson, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, has also played for Newcastle and QPR.
He previously said he intends to appeal against the conviction.
