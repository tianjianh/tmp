Ed scooped the night's main award, album of the year, for his record X - which was the best-selling record of 2014 in the UK.
"I was really worried about this album," he said, accepting his trophy from actor Russell Crowe, "it took a long time to make."
He added it had been a "very, very good year for British music".
