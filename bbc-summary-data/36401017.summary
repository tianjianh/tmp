Irishman Harrington, 44, was vice-captain under Paul McGinley when Europe won at Gleneagles two years ago.
It will be the fourth time Dane Bjorn, 45, has held the role but it is the first time for Scotsman Lawrie, 47.
Speaking at the PGA Championship, Clarke said he plans to appoint two more vice-captains later in the year.
Europe will defend the cup against the United States at Hazeltine, Minnesota, from 30 September to 2 October.
The team are seeking an unprecedented fourth straight victory and their ninth in the last 11 biennial contests.
"The three bring a wealth of experience and knowledge and their input will be invaluable to Europe's cause," said Clarke, 47.
"I could not have asked for anybody better to be standing shoulder to shoulder with me in the bid to bring the Ryder Cup home."
United States captain Davis Love III is also planning to name five deputies for the matches.
Love has already confirmed Tiger Woods, Tom Lehman, Steve Stricker and Jim Furyk will be in his backroom team.
