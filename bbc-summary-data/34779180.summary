A man who admitted stabbing a woman whom he believed had slashed his niece has been jailed for five years and three months for attempted murder.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Stephen Mann, 39, from Saltcoats, admitted attacking Annette Campbell in the North Ayrshire town's Dockhead Street on 14 July this year.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that after being detained Mann told police: "I hope I got her and killed her."
The victim suffered non-life-threatening back injuries.
The court heard that before the stabbing, Mann saw Ms Campbell in the town's Albion Bar and told her she was "getting it", adding: "You're dead."
Minutes later as she stood outside the bar chatting, he walked up and stabbed her in the back.
Mann later claimed that he carried out the attack because he believed Ms Campbell was responsible for slashing his nice.
He told police: "Nobody slashes my niece and gets away with it."
The court heard that Mann's niece was slashed at a party on 14 April 2014, but Ms Campbell denies any responsibility for this.
The doctor who treated Ms Campbell described her injury as non-life-threatening, but was of the opinion that if the stab wound had penetrated deeper her heart could have been pierced.
Mann also pleaded guilty to having a knife in a public place.
