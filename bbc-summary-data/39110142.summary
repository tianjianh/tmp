Richard Miskelly was attacked at a house on Bangor Road in the town during the early hours of Sunday, and later died at the roadside.
Police investigating the killing have charged a 19-year-old man with murder and perverting the course of justice.
The accused is due before Newtownards Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning.
A second 19-year-old man, who was also arrested on suspicion of murder, was released unconditionally in relation to the killing.
However, he was also questioned about an attack on a 27-year-old man in the Bangor Road on Sunday morning and a file has been sent to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to that assault.
The attack on Mr Miskelly was reported to police at about 05:30 GMT on Sunday.
He was found lying on the road and was treated by ambulance staff, but died at the scene a short time later.
