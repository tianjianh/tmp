The refurbishment of the old waterside station was the preferred option following a consultation.
Funding still needs to be secured.
Minister Danny Kennedy said: "It is clear from the consultation that there is a strong attachment to the old Waterside station."
He added: "It is an important part of the city's built heritage and once refurbished has the potential to serve as an attractive destination for tourists arriving in the city.
"However, there are wider opportunities which I feel we should look to take advantage of as we develop this project.
"I have been inspired by what I have seen elsewhere and the role that cycling and public transport can play in creating accessible and attractive urban environments.
"In light of that and the extensive work already undertaken to develop walking and cycling infrastructure in Londonderry, I believe we have a unique opportunity to deliver an innovative and inspirational project which reflects the ambitions the city has set for itself in the one plan.
"This hub would serve the wider city and surrounding area. It could assist in the regeneration of the city and enhance the reputation and vibrancy of Londonderry.
"The aim of the project would be to provide facilities for cyclists including parking, changing and maintenance within a refurbished station.
"In addition the station would be linked directly to the Peace Bridge and existing greenways."
Opportunities are also to be explored by the minister to extend walking and cycling infrastructure in the city, including between the university, Ebrington and cross-border links.
"This project is at a very early stage and delivery will be subject to securing funding," said Mr Kennedy.
