The theft happened outside St John's Kirk in St John's Place in the city before 23:30 on Monday.
It was the second time the life-sized doll had been stolen from the nativity scene in the past two years.
Police Scotland said three males would be reported to the procurator fiscal in due course.
Anne Chat, who serves as an elder at the church and also works as a volunteer, said after the theft: "Last year someone stole the doll from the display too, but it turned up again a while later.
"It just seems to be something that people do these days, it's a shame."
Mrs Chat said the nativity had been put in place by the locals on Saturday evening after a lantern procession attended by about a hundred people and a pipe band.
