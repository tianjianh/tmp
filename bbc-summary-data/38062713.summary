This Way Up 16 will draw on research by organisations including Creative Scotland and the Raising Films report.
The studies suggest that only 14% of women working in film have children.
They also say women are 75% more likely than men to cite parental responsibilities as a career barrier in the creative industries.
The annual conference, taking place this year at Glasgow Film Theatre on 29 and 30 November, will also examine opportunities for parents to enjoy films.
Organisers of TWU 2016 said few cinemas provide little more than monthly or weekly family friendly screenings and children's club events.
