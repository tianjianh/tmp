Niall Grace attack: Assault charge withdrawn

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was accused over a "one-punch attack" on a Londonderry footballer has had the charge against him withdrawn.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Matthew McDermott, 20, from Cornshell Fields, had been accused of committing grievous bodily harm with intent against Institute FC's Niall Grace.
The offence was alleged to have happened outside a city centre bar on 11 September 2016.
Mr Grace sustained serious head injuries from which he has since recovered.
A Public Prosecution Service barrister told Londonderry Magistrates Court on Thursday that the charge was being replaced by a formal caution.
