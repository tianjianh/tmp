[SN]TITLE[SN]
June Osborne announced as new Bishop of Llandaff

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Church in Wales has appointed a second female bishop to be its new Bishop of Llandaff.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Very Reverend June Osborne, Dean of Salisbury, was the first woman to become dean at a medieval cathedral.
She replaces Dr Barry Morgan who retired at the end of January.
Her appointment was made by the Bench of Bishops after the initial process failed to select one of the candidates leading to an accusation of homophobia which the church strongly denied.
In March, Dr Jeffrey John, who did not get the number of votes needed to be chosen, spoke out after the process ended and said homophobic remarks had been made at the electoral college meeting.
It is understood Dr John received a majority of the votes, but not the two-thirds required by Church rules.
The Church "strongly denied" the allegations of homophobia and said a candidate required two-thirds of the vote to be chosen.
On Thursday, it was announced that Dean Osborne would become the Church in Wales' second female bishop. Canon Joanna Penberthy was consecrated as Bishop of St Davids in January.
The diocese of Llandaff serves most of Cardiff, the south Wales valleys and the Vale of Glamorgan.
Her appointment will be confirmed on 14 July at a meeting of the Sacred Synod of Church in Wales Bishops in Brecon Cathedral.
She will be consecrated as bishop on 15 July and enthroned at Llandaff Cathedral on 22 July.
The Church's Senior Bishop, the Bishop of Swansea and Brecon, John Davies, said the diocese would be "richly blessed".
He added: "June's track record admirably demonstrates her passion for Christian ministry modelled on the Gospel imperatives of love, justice, inclusivity and openness. All of these are qualities which I and my fellow bishops warmly support and welcome."
Dean Osborne said the appointment was a "great privilege".
"It will be something of a homecoming for the family, particularly because my husband is from Cardiff and it is a place we know and love," she said.
Dean June will celebrate her final Sunday at Salisbury Cathedral on 9 July.
