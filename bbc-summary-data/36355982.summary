A team of firefighters in Auckland, New Zealand have rescued a group of ducklings from a cesspit, reuniting them with their mother.

The Titirangi Volunteer Fire Brigade received a call from the public on Saturday morning.
One of them reached down into the cesspit while a colleague held on to him to prevent him from falling.
"The mother duck seemed pretty anxious," chief officer Randolph Covich told the BBC.
"But we got them all and sent them off into the wild."
The rescue, which took about 20 minutes, was filmed by the volunteer team and uploaded onto their Facebook page. It received more than 200,000 views over 24 hours.
"We're surprised to see how far the video went," said Chief Officer Covich.
"Winter is coming so we thought a video like this would be something to cheer people up a bit."
