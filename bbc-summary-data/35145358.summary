Glasgow Warriors play down fears of Taqele Naiyaravoro exit

The possibility of Taqele Naiyaravoro heading back to Australia after only a season with Glasgow Warriors has been played down by coach Gregor Townsend.

The wing, 24, has made a big impression for the Pro12 side since arriving from Waratahs after the World Cup.
And a Sunday newspaper report suggested that his former club would be keen for him to return at the end of the season.
"He's contracted to us," said Townsend. "There's always speculation, but we're delighted with him being with us."
Reports in the Australian media had suggested prior to the World Cup that Naiyaravoro might not join Warriors as planned.
His agent, Tyran Smith, said the player would arrive in Scotland to "honour his commitments" but added "at least for the first year".
Having failed to win a place in Australia's World Cup squad, Naiyaravoro won his first cap as a late substitute against the United States in September.
It ended the possibility of the Fijian player representing his homeland or winning a Scotland cap through residency rules at the end of his three-year Warriors contract.
That led to further speculation about his club future and it has heightened after he ran in three tries in last week's 43-6 destruction of Scarlets in the European Champions Cup.
"He's settled in really well and playing excellent rugby, so we're delighted with him being with us," Townsend told BBC Scotland following the 9-6 win in Saturday's return game in Llanelli.
"He's improving with every game and he got double figures in ball carries last night."
