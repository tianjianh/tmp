The 33-year-old, a former Wales Under-21 international, moves to the region after making more than 150 appearances for Sale Sharks.
"I have strong links with the Dragons through many of the players and coaches, so I am looking forward to my return home," said Macleod.
"It's great to be able to come back to Wales for both personal and professional reasons."
Macleod adds experience to a young Dragons squad.
"The coaches are assembling a young and exciting squad and I am looking forward to joining the region," he said.
"I feel that part of my role next season will be to mentor the youngsters as well as challenging for a spot on the team sheet."
Dragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: "We have made a strong and conscious decision to back our youngsters and their development, and signing someone of Nick's calibre recognises this as he will act as a catalyst for these players.
"Nick will be mentoring the likes of Dorian Jones, Angus O'Brien and Arwel Robson whilst also playing his part in the squad moving forward next season.
"His vast experience and maturity within the Aviva Premiership will be a valuable addition to our young squad."
