He plans to return to the campus in the autumn to work with students on their song writing and composition skills.

Director of arts and culture at the university, Dr Geoff Willcocks, said: "Tony is without doubt a rock icon and he's an inspiration to so many people around the world.
"It's wonderful to have such an important and respected international figure working with us."
The head of performing arts at the university, Dr Sara Reed, said it was an honour to have the musician at the department.
She added: "His huge wealth of experience and musical knowledge is beyond value to our students.
"It's a fantastic opportunity for them to learn from such an immensely talented individual."
