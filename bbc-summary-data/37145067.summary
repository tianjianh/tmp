Reports had suggested that the 23-year-old was set to leave Goodison Park, with Chelsea said to be interested in signing the Belgium international.
"It's great news for everybody," said Koeman after the 2-1 win at West Brom, during which Lukaku came on as a first-half substitute.
Asked if he might be offered a new deal, Koeman said: "That's possible."
