Mad Men star Jon Hamm has recently completed treatment for alcohol addiction, his publicist has confirmed.

The actor, who plays hard-drinking advertising executive Don Draper in the hit TV show, asked for "privacy and sensitivity" following the revelation.
It is unclear when he sought treatment, but he did so with the support of his long-time partner, actress and film-maker Jennifer Westfeldt.
Hamm has recently been seen promoting the final season of the US drama.
Celebrity website TMZ, which first reported the story, said the Golden Globe-winning actor was treated for 30 days at the Silver Hill Hospital in New Canaan, Connecticut.
Hamm has been asked to compare himself to his Mad Men character several times over the series' eight-year run.
"I don't drink as much as Don Draper," he told the Daily Mail in 2012. "I would be unconscious if I did."
But the actor also admitted he turned to alcohol after his father died from complications of diabetes in 1991.
Hamm - who was 20 at the time - was left without parents, having lost his mother 10 years earlier.
"It just changed everything," he told GQ last year. "It was just a profound sense of being alone. And that lasted a while.
"I was in college, and I had to start over again. I started drinking; it was a rough time.
"I was at a crossroads. It really could have gone the wrong way."
Although Mad Men is ending this year, Hamm's career is going strong.
He has roles in two high-profile Netflix series: Playing doomsday preacher Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne in Tina Fey's critically-acclaimed comedy Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt; and starring in the upcoming Wet Hot American Summer, a prequel to the 2001 cult indie comedy about a rowdy summer camp.
The star has also appeared in films such as The Town, Bridesmaids and Kissing Jessica Stein.
He met Westfeldt on the latter film, in which she played the title role.
