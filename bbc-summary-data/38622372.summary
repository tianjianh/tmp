Dors, who was seen as the British Marilyn Monroe, died in 1984 aged 52.
Swindon Heritage magazine campaigned for the plaque, which sits between two Kent Road houses in Swindon's Old Town.
Dors was born at the Haven Nursing Home, later turned into a house. Next door was originally a GP surgery which allowed doctors to walk through and assist the neighbouring midwives.
The 1959 pink Cadillac car given to Dors by Shepperton Studios was parked outside the homes for the plaque unveiling.
Born Diana Mary Fluck, Dors became known as a 1950s blonde sex symbol, but was also well-respected for her acting skills.
Her youngster son Jason Dors-Lake, 47, said he was "very honoured" there was now a plaque for his mother and said it was "very moving" to be at its unveiling.
"I love the fact my mother loved life," he said.
"She highlighted womanhood and female power."
His 27-year-old daughter Ruby Lake was also at the event.
Noel Beauchamp from the Swindon Heritage group, which arranged permission for the plaque, said the precise location of her birth had been a closely-guarded secret until now.
The new plaque spans both buildings at 61 and 62 Kent Road.
Dors' birth certificate revealed the location as the Haven Nursing Home on Kent Road in Old Town Swindon but in 1931 the nursing home - which was a base for midwives - was turned into a house.
The adjoining property was the doctor's surgery and the two buildings had internal interconnecting doors that allowed the doctor to assist the midwives when necessary.
Paul Sullivan, who runs the Diana Dors website and archive, said: "Swindon meant a lot to Diana and she often came here.
"People here are very proud she is from Swindon."
