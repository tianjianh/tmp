Four Seasons said the Hutchinson Care Group and the Spa Nursing Home Group are in talks with it to buy the homes.
Hutchinson Care Homes is interested in buying Antrim Care Home.
Spa Nursing Home Group is interested in Oakridge Care Home, Ballynahinch.
Four Seasons said it had reached agreement with Hutchinson and with Spa on the "key points of their purchase of the homes".
It said transfer of ownership was dependent "on a number of steps including signing legal agreements and the RQIA transferring registration of the home from Four Seasons to the purchasers".
It said all parties were "working to move this process along quickly to a conclusion".
It added that Hutchinson and Spa "intend to take on the homes as going concerns and if the sale completes, then permanent staff in the homes would transfer to the new owners".
"This would mean that residents who remain in the homes would continue to be cared for by the people who are looking after them now," it said.
"We had come to the decision to close the homes with great reluctance and so we welcome the possibility that they will continue to provide care," a Four Seasons spokesperson added.
"We will do everything we can to help facilitate a smooth transfer of these homes to new ownership with no disruption to the care of residents and continuity of employment."
