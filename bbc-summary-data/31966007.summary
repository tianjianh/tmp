A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's orbit lines up in between the Sun and the Earth.
The Moon blocks out the Sun's light for a short time, casting a shadow on the Earth.
But will you be able to see it, or will it be cloudy?
BBC weather forecaster, Simon King, has sent us a special solar eclipse forecast for Friday.
Remember: never look directly at the Sun as you can permanently damage your eyes.
