Titan Arum produced a bud several weeks ago, which has recently been growing at several centimetres a day.
But up until Friday morning it had not been clear if it would produce a leaf, or a flower.
It will be the first time the so-called "corpse flower" has ever blossomed in Scotland.
It gets its name from the horrible stench it produces, to attract insects to pollinate it.
YOUR COMMENTS!
There were road works on my street and a lot of gas was coming through a broken pipe and it was so bad!

The worst thing that I have ever smelled was probably the French cheese that we sometimes get when we are on holiday there.

My sister was hoovering and then suddenly it stopped working and EXPLODED. It smelt very bad and me and my sister felt sick.

I found fox poo in my Grandma's garden and it was awful.
