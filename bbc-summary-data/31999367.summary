The Judge in his case said Brown had completed all his requirements and officially closed the case.
After the hearing, Brown tweeted: "IM OFF PROBATION!!!!!!!! Thank the Lord!!!!!!"
Brown pleaded guilty to attacking Rihanna just hours before the Grammy Awards in 2009.
Since then he was won 3 Grammys.
Brown and his lawyer hugged in the courtroom and again in a courthouse lift.
The singer has been under supervision by court and probation officials since mid-2009 and initially avoided problems with the case.
However since 2013 he has struggled to complete his community service and had his probation revoked after he performed a show in Northern California without
permission.
His lawyer Mark Geragos said: "I couldn't be more delighted."
He also said his client was making good progress. "He is in a spot right now and a place right now that I couldn't be prouder of him."
