We don't tip black people, note to Virginia waitress said

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Customers at a restaurant in Virginia left their black waitress a racist note instead of a tip, the owner tells BBC.

Waitress Kelly Carter says a couple had written on the receipt: "Great service don't tip black people."
But the waitress said she would gladly serve the pair again, adding "one hateful remark cannot stop me".
Tipping is customary in the US, where restaurant servers often earn less than the minimum wage, with tips supposed to make up the difference in pay.
Ms Carter told local media that one of the diners had even complimented the breakfast she served them on Saturday.
She said she would recognise them if they returned to Anita's New Mexico Style Cafe.
"My arms are still opened to him," she said, offering to serve them again.
"That's him, not me," she said during her morning shift, adding that "he only hurt himself. He only makes me stronger."
The white couple, who appeared to be in their mid-20s, left after spending $30.52 (Â£25) on food.
Restaurant owner Tommy Tellez told local media: "I was appalled, though it's kind of in line with the political landscape, unfortunately."
People have been dropping by the restaurant to give Ms Carter cash, Mr Tellez said, and a YouCaring campaign has raised over $300 (Â£245) for her.
Ms Carter says she hopes to see the couple again.
"Just me serving them will let them know they did not get the best of me. And I truly mean that."
