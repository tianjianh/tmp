He says local councils have not been taking the problem of homophobic bullying seriously enough.
Writing in the Independent on Sunday, the Pop Idol winner says: "Through the various seminars I attended I picked up one recurring theme, teachers and heads of schools were more than often not backed up by local authorities when it came to homophobic language."
The 34-year-old has revealed he's spoken to the Education Secretary Michael Gove about his concerns.
The two met at a conference in London earlier this year and Young said Mr Gove's reaction was "encouraging".
Research carried out in schools last year by the charity Stonewall found 55% of gay young people experience homophobic bullying and 99% hear the phrases "that's so gay" or "you're so gay" in school.
In July the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, launched a campaign to try to stop homophobic bullying in Church of England schools.
