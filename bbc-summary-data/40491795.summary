Jacqui Smith to head Sandwell's children's services

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former home secretary Jacqui Smith will chair a new trust tasked with turning round a children's services department.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government-appointed trust was set up after the services at Sandwell Council were ranked "inadequate".
Mrs Smith will head the new Sandwell Children's Social Care Trust which is being asked to bring "rapid improvements".
She said she relished the opportunity of improving the lives of vulnerable children and families in Sandwell.
Mrs Smith added: "My job is to help build that team by challenging us all to find the best ways to improve and innovate - and by making the trust a great place to work."

Sandwell's children services was rated inadequate in June 2015 after another poor rating in 2013.
Ofsted inspectors in 2015 said the department did "not fully understand the scale and prevalence of child sexual exploitation".
"There are widespread and serious failures that create or leave children being harmed or at risk of harm," the report found:.
An Ofsted inspection last year found "positive progress" had been made.
The council said since the announcement in October 2016 that an independent trust would run the services, it had worked with commissioner Malcolm Newsam and the Department for Education.
Council Leader Steve Eling welcomed Mrs Smith's appointment and her "wealth of experience".
"With the setting up of the trust, we want to build on recent improvements with a board that will focus on providing a clear vision, be innovative and strive to deliver rapid and sustained improvements," he said.
