Zoe Bremner's death at Dundasvale Court, in the Cowcaddens area of Glasgow, following a party, is being treated as unexplained.
Two other teenagers, both aged 15, who also took ill, have been discharged from hospital. Police said drug use was one of the lines of inquiry.
Knightswood Secondary head teacher Kay Dingwall said it was "tragic news".
"Our heartfelt sympathies and prayers are with Zoe's family and friends at this extremely sad time," she said.
"Zoe was a really lovely girl and will be sorely missed by all the staff and pupils at the school.
"We will do all that we can to help and support young people and staff who will obviously be deeply affected by this saddest of news today and during the difficult days ahead."
The teenage boy and girl who fell ill were treated at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
Police inquiries so far have revealed that the teenagers were at a party in the Yoker area in the late afternoon.
They returned to Dundasvale Court later in the evening and contacted emergency services at about 00:45 on Sunday.
Det Insp Greig Wilkie, of Police Scotland, said: "This is very disturbing and our thoughts are with the family at this distressing time. We are currently carrying out extensive inquiries in relation to the incident.
"Our investigation will include whether any substances have been a factor in this incident. If anyone has any information which could assist our investigation, I would urge them to contact us."
Anyone with any information should contact police.
