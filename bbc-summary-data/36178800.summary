Trainer Dr Richard Newland announced the decision after the 13-year-old was pulled up in the Sentinel Handicap Chase at Uttoxeter on Saturday.
Pineau De Re had missed the cut for this year's National at Aintree earlier in April and unseated his rider in the Scottish National.
The horse first ran in 2007 and won eight races during his career, the last win coming at Carlisle in December.

Pineau De Re was a surprise 25-1 winner of the Grand National and marked the rise of GP turned trainer Dr Richard Newland.
In the Worcestershire village where the horse was stabled there was a proud sign - Claines: Home of the 2014 Grand National winner Pineau De Re.
Named after a wine, he had a fine career which included a third place at the Cheltenham Festival and becoming the first horse since Bindaree in 2003 to win another race after the National.
Before being switched to Newland, he had been trained in Ireland by Philip Fenton who is serving a three-year ban from racing after being found in possession of banned anabolic steroids.
