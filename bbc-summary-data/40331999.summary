The 22-year-old made 59 Hibs appearances and had loan spells at Dundee and Queen of the South.
"He is a player who has massive potential," Bairns boss Peter Houston told the club website.
"He made a big impact when he first broke into the Hibernian team and impressed me anytime we played against him while at Queen of the South."
Harris made his Hibs debut in October 2012 and played a starring role against Falkirk later that season, scoring his first senior goal at Hampden as the Easter Road side came from 3-0 down to win a Scottish Cup semi final.
He made just one league start for the Championship winners last term, having scored four goals in 27 games for Queens in 2015-16.
