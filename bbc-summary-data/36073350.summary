The Derbyshire swimmer, 19, took a silver medal in the 100m breaststroke at the British Championships, behind Siobhan-Marie O'Connor, on Sunday.
But Vasey could still go to Brazil as part of the relay squad, as O'Connor also won the 100m freestyle.
"They could want me to swim the breaststroke leg if Siobhan-Marie swims freestyle," Vasey said.
British Swimming will announce the squad to go to Brazil on Thursday and can take a team of up to 30 male and female swimmers across the disciplines.
Only eight swimmers have so far guaranteed their places by going under the qualification mark in their respective events, with fellow City of Derby swimmer Adam Peaty one of those to do so.
Vasey said: "I had mixed emotions after the race because I swam a personal best and couldn't do much more, but finished second.
"If I hadn't swum very well and finished second then I would be devastated, but I was pleased with my performance, so I can't really complain."
Vasey has received support from the Derbyshire Institute of Sport (DIS) to help her attend overseas training camps in Australia, Doha and Dubai and says that has been crucial to her improvement.
"Getting to swim long course for six or seven weeks in a row is massively important, as we just don't get that access at home with so few 50m pools," she said.
"Hopefully it will have helped me get a place at the Olympics, which is every swimmer's dream, but if not I definitely have another Olympic cycle in me, if not two."
