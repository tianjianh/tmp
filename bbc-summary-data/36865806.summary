Phil Brown: Sam Allardyce's England interests Southend boss

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend United boss Phil Brown would be interested in the England assistant manager's job if he was offered the role under Sam Allardyce.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Brown was assistant to Allardyce, who is set to be named as Roy Hodgson's successor, at Bolton and Blackpool.
But he rejected the chance to be his number two when Allardyce was appointed by Sunderland last October.
"When the national assistant role comes around it's a different ball game altogether," said the 57-year-old.
"I wouldn't have said I'm in the running, but if that comes around it's different to being assistant manager at a domestic team."
The former Hull and Preston manager has been in charge at Roots Hall since 2013, and led Southend to promotion into League One via the play-offs in 2014-15.
Brown, who also won promotion to the Premier League with Hull in 2008, told BBC Radio Humberside: "When he offered me the assistant manager's role at Sunderland it was a really tough decision for me to turn it down.
"Once you've been a manager, to go back as a number two it was a big ask for me, so I would hope he respected that."
