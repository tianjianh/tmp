(Close): The London market lost value in afternoon trading on Friday as concerns over Greece's ability to maintain its debt repayments returned.

The FTSE 100 was down 33.96 at 7006.96
The biggest riser was Associated British Foods (ABH), up more than 3% after investment bank Goldman Sachs changed its rating on the stock from "sell" to "buy".
Pump maker Weir Group gained 3% on positive news from North America's shale gas producers.
An upgrade by broker Credit Suisse also helped boost Weir's share price.
The broker said the stock's 17% "underperformance" over the year-to-date made it an attractive option for investors.
Another 3% riser was mining company Fresnillo, as it recovered some earlier losses over the week.
Among the FTSE 100's biggest fallers were supermarket Morrisons, down 3% and International Consolidated Airlines  also down almost 3% despite the Irish parliament - as expected - approving its plan to take over Aer Lingus.
On the currency markets, the pound was down on earlier weak UK economic growth data, although it trimmed losses. It ended down 0.27% against the dollar at $1.5273, and down 0.51% against the euro at â‚¬1.3954.
