Notts County Ladies: HMRC winding-up case adjourned again until July 2017

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A winding-up petition against Notts County Ladies has been adjourned for a second time, with the club given until 3 July to pay their debts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The case concerns money owed to HM Revenue and Customs and was previously adjourned on 6 February for 49 days.
On Monday, a court was told the Women's Super League One club's owner, Alan Hardy, aimed to clear the debt.
The court was told Hardy has already paid money owed to HMRC by Notts' men's team, which he bought in January.
Notts County Ladies finished sixth in Women's Super League One last season and reached this year's Women's FA Cup last eight, before losing 2-0 at Liverpool in the quarter-finals on Sunday.
Managed by Rick Passmoor, they appeared in two domestic cup finals in 2015, including facing Chelsea in the first Women's FA Cup final to be staged at Wembley.
