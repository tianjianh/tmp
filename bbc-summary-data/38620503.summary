[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 1-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
FA Cup giant-killers Sutton fought back to draw 1-1 with Eastleigh at the end of a special week for the club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tyler Garrett caught Sutton cold by heading Eastleigh into an early lead after six minutes, nodding home Ross Stearn's pinpoint cross.
Sutton, who dumped AFC Wimbledon out of the FA Cup in midweek, put in a dogged display as they searched for an equaliser, but they could have been 2-0 down as Mikael Mandron twice went close before the break.
But Matt Tubbs' header in the 73rd minute gave Sutton a reward for their perseverance and they can now focus on next weekend's glamorous FA Cup fourth-round tie against Leeds.
