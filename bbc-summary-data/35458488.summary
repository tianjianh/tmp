Swansea City striker Eder has joined Lille on loan until the end of the season.

The Portugal international, 28, has started two Swansea league games since signing from Sporting Braga in June.
"I am very happy to be here. I also liked the first contact I had with the coach and the entire technical staff," Eder told the Ligue 1 club's website.
Meanwhile, West Brom have rejected Swansea City's offer to sign Wales defender James Chester on loan.
Chester, 27, has made just one Premier League start this season after joining from Hull City for Â£8m in July 2015.
Swansea are also thought to be interested in Swindon Town and Iraq midfielder Yaser Kasim.
Following Jonjo Shelvey's move to Newcastle in January, the Swans are looking for midfield reinforcements.
Kasim is out of contract at the end of the season and Swindon chairman Lee Power says two Premier League clubs are interested in the 24-year-old.
