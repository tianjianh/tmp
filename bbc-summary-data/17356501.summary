Jersey's planning minister has drawn up guidelines for developing the States-owned land near Rouge Bouillon.
Deputy Rob Duhamel said it would allow the sites to be used for housing in the future.
He said the States needed to use some of its own assets to provide affordable homes and he believed allowing development would encourage the regeneration of the north of town.
The guidelines include details of the planning problems that need to be overcome, such as the school's protected grounds and trees.
He said: "The development of the site offers considerable potential, with the conversion and refurbishment of the historic building, as well as the chance to build new homes to the rear and the east of old school building, which should provide for a real mix of homes to be created."
He said the former Summerland and ambulance station site nearby could also be used for new homes.
Deputy Duhamel added: "The scale of these two sites could, in the future, afford an opportunity to create a new residential quarter with its own identity, as well as a chance to restore street frontages, in a contemporary style, that reflects the architectural character of this part of the town."
Islanders can have their say on the draft guidelines atwww.gov.jeuntil 9 April.
