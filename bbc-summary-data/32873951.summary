The Blades reached the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup but finished fifth in League One and failed to gain promotion through the play-offs.
A statement on the club's website said: "A change in direction was necessary for the forthcoming season."
Clough, 49, had managerial spells at Burton Albion and Derby County manager before replacing David Weir at Bramall Lane in October 2013.
Clough's backroom staff of Gary Crosby, Andy Garner, Martin Taylor, Simon Clough, Michael Forsyth and Matt Brown will also leave the club, which faces a fifth successive year in the third tier.
The club statement added: "The search for the club's new first-team manager will now start and it is hoped this will result in identifying and recruiting the right candidate within a relatively short period of time.
"The club would like to place on record its thanks to Nigel, as well as his backroom staff."
Former England international forward Clough started his managerial career with Burton Albion in 1998 after a successful playing career that took in stints with Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Manchester City.
Having guided the Brewers to the top of the Conference Premier, he left to take over Derby in January 2009, following in the footsteps of his late father Brian, who managed the club to the league title in the 1970s.
