Bartoletta, the 30-year-old world champion, took gold with a new personal best of 7.17m.
Reese, 29, could only manage 7.15m with her final attempt, claiming silver ahead of Serbia's Ivana Spanovic, who jumped a national record of 7.08m.
Britain's Jazmin Sawyer, 22, finished eighth with a jump of 6.69m.

"Eighth in my first Olympic final is good, but I jumped 6.69m and I'm better than that," she said.
"I know I shouldn't really be disappointed. I'm the highest-placed Brit and I've beaten a lot of girls that I've been thinking are a lot better than me, but I wanted to beat more of them."
Fellow Briton Lorraine Ugen, 24, was eliminated after the first three jumps.
The Londoner, a bronze medallist at this year's World Indoor Championships, could only jump 6.58m to finish 11th.
Bartoletta, however, had little time to enjoy her victory on Wednesday night - she had to focus on the women's 4x100m relay on Thursday morning.
She is part of the US squad running in the heats at 11:28 (15:28 BST).
"I couldn't really celebrate. When I won, I realised I have to be back in the morning for the relay," she said.
Russia's sole track and field athlete at the Rio Olympics, Darya Klishina, failed to make an impact as she finished in ninth.
The Florida-based 25-year-old, who was suspended by athletics world governing body the IAAF on Friday only for the decision to be overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, could only manage a best leap of 6.63m, meaning she was eliminated after three jumps.
"I feel really well and I've gotten a lot of support from other athletes," she said. "I missed the last week-and-a-half of training, so I could've done a lot better than I did."
