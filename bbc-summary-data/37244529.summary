Drug gang 'leader' jailed over knife killing

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drug dealer has been jailed for 15 years for his part in the stabbing of a father who bled to death.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tevin Birmingham, 22, of Spring Road, Ipswich, was sentenced to 15 years in custody for manslaughter and will serve a minimum of 10 years.
The victim, Andrew McGowan, 33, was found stabbed in a flat in Dickens Court, Great Yarmouth, last November.
His co-defendant, Warren Ricardo Blake, of Thorncliffe Road, London, is serving 17 years for Mr McGowan's murder.
During the trial in June, the court was told a drunk Mr McGowan had gone to the flat where Birmingham and Blake were staying, armed with a claw hammer.
It was thought a row ensued over drugs, with Blake stabbing Mr McGowan five times, piercing his heart, causing him to bleed to death.
At Norwich Crown Court, Birmingham's defence barrister Steven Perian made the case for a lesser sentence, arguing that at no time during the incident had Birmingham wielded the knife.
But passing sentence, Judge Stephen Holt said previous offences showed Birmingham had a violent track record.
He added: "It's quite clear you were fully aware and in joint possession of that knife. It's clear you were the leader of the two and older. You took the leading role. Blake looked up to you."
Justice Holt sentenced Birmingham to a further five years on licence, citing a probation officer's report which said he posed a danger to the public.
Birmingham, who had pleaded guilty to supplying class A drugs, was also given a 30-month jail term to run concurrently.
