Gordon Strachan no longer wants Scotland job, claims Chris Sutton

Gordon Strachan no longer wants to be Scotland head coach, former Celtic striker Chris Sutton has suggested.

Scotland face Slovakia on Tuesday having slipped up in a 1-1 draw at home to Lithuania in World Cup qualifying.
"He has been rude, he's been cantankerous and I just feel he doesn't want to be there any more and he is showing that in every interview," Sutton said of Strachan on BBC 5 live.
"That's his body language and I think he wants out."
Scotland were booed off at Hampden Park on Saturday and Sutton thinks that Strachan's responses to the media are turning the fans - and players - against him.
"I think his comments in the summer were appalling," said the 43-year-old who earned one cap for England.
"He said that Scotland were a nation of scared footballers and I think of the impact that would have had on the players at that time - they would have been totally disgruntled by that.
"I think he's losing credibility with the fans. I don't agree that a lot of fans are still on his side.
"Gordon Strachan said Scotland don't have big stars like Gareth Bale and then the Scottish fans see Iceland, they see Northern Ireland, they see Wales and their performance and think we want a piece of that."
Sutton also questioned the choice of Fulham's Chris Martin for the lone striker role.
"Here's the biggest problem - that Gordon Strachan the other night played Chris Martin, a centre forward who hasn't scored in 20 club games," he said.
"And you have Steven Fletcher, who has actually started scoring again for Sheffield Wednesday, you have Leigh Griffiths who has scored barrel load of goals and who Gordon, for whatever reason, doesn't rate and nobody in Scotland other than Gordon understands that."
Former Scotland defender Steven Pressley, who scouted Slovakia for Strachan in their game against Slovenia on Saturday, issued a strong defence of the current team boss.
"Do you not think that Gordon analyses the opposition, considers many permutations and comes up for a reason for playing certain players in certain games?" he told BBC Scotland.
"I was not party to the decision ahead of the Lithuania game, but I can understand his reason for playing Martin.
"Lithuania are a team that deny the space to the opposition behind them, meaning that Scotland would be looking to have a link player in the team and that would have been Gordon's reason I imagine."
Pressley, who is confident that Scotland can get a good result in Slovakia, also stressed that changing the manager again is not the answer.
"We have to look at the bigger picture," he said. "When was the last time our under-21s, for example, qualified for a major event? It was something like 25 years ago.
"So the reality is we are not bringing through the players we had before.
"It is like groundhog day. Two or three years down the line, we want another manager. The reality is that that is not the fix.
"There surely comes a point when it runs deeper than just the manager.
"We have to make radical changes to the way our young players are developed and, until we do that, nothing is going to change.
"It is groundhog day. We change the manager and nothing changes."
