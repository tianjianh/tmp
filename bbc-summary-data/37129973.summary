[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A hospital is raising car parking charges by up to 40 per cent in a bid to offset a £40m deficit.

The cost of a four-hour stay at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport will increase from £6 to £8, with a short stay rising from £2.50 to £3.50 from 1 September.
Stockport NHS Foundation Trust said the hike makes "savings in areas which do not affect patient services".
Residents said the increase will cause further problems on nearby streets.
A homeowner said: "I don't begrudge people parking here, but something needs to be done about it.
"In Hazel Grove everywhere is resident-only parking, maybe they could think about doing something like that."
Stockport NHS Foundation Trust has already announced plans to cut 350 full-time posts, closed a surgical ward, and axe eight trauma and orthopaedic beds to reduce costs.
A spokesman said: "We fully appreciate that increasing car parking charges will always be unpopular, but it is important we are able to make vital savings in areas which do not affect patient services."
Concessions have been made for patients including free parking for patients with cancer and significantly reduced rates for some patients with long-term conditions.
