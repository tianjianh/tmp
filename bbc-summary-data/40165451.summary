An emergency call handler has been sacked after firefighters took more than 90 minutes to reach a fatal blaze.

The man, who has not been named, was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings, Devon and Somerset Fire Service said.
Molly Wigmore, 76, died in the fire at her Plymouth home in October last year.
The first 999 call was made at 05:17 GMT but none had arrived by the time a second call was made at 06:44, ahead of a fire engine arriving at 06:50.
Ms Wigmore's house, in Sussex Road, is about a mile and a half from Camels Head Fire Station.
An inquest is expected to examine whether the delay played any part in her death, on 19 October.
The fire service said in a statement it was unable to comment on the case until the inquest was over.
"We continue to offer the family of the deceased our deepest condolences," the service added.
Tributes left at the house said Ms Wigmore was an "inspirational, kind, gentle and sweet lady".
