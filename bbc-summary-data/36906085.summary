Aubameyang, who is contracted with the Bundesliga club until 2020, has been linked with a move to Manchester City.
The two clubs play each other in the International Champions Cup in China on Thursday, but the 27-year-old will not feature as he has flown home to be with his pregnant wife.
"Right now he is our player, he stays our player," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
"I am totally confident [he will stay]. He is a huge personality for us. Right now, I would say he stays but I can't predict the future."
The Gabon international scored 25 league goals for Dortmund last season.
In a recent interview with a German broadcaster, Aubameyang said he would only consider leaving Dortmund for Real Madrid.
