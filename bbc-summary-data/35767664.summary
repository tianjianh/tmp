[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pair arrested at Heathrow Airport over FGM offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man and woman have been arrested at Heathrow Airport in connection with female genital mutilation (FGM) offences, Metropolitan Police said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The woman, 49, was arrested after arriving on a flight from Nairobi, Kenya. An eight-year-old girl in her company was taken into protective care.
The man, 45, who was not on the flight, was also arrested at the airport.
The pair are being questioned on suspicion of assisting a non-UK person to carry out FGM overseas.
Concerns were raised by a south London school about one of their pupils who had failed to attend school and was believed to have been taken to Somalia.
The arrests were made after officers from the Camberwell Child Abuse Investigation Team were issued with a FGM Prevention Order.
FGM, is when a girl's genitals are either partially or totally removed for non-medical reasons.
Doctors, nurses, midwives and teachers are now required to report cases of girls who have suffered the treatment to police, or risk losing their jobs.
The rules, which came into force in October, apply in England and Wales when girls under 18 say they have been cut or staff recognise the signs.
