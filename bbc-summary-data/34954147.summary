Called the Bay of Refuge, it features a transparency of an oil painting by J T Allerston set into a metal frame.
It was commissioned to show how the resort's unique geography helped shelter passing vessels in the 18th and 19th centuries.
The artwork at Garrison Square forms part of trail exploring the area's maritime history.
Steve Carvill, who created the artwork, said it had been placed at such a height to allow people to match up the horizon from the painting with the present day horizon.
He said: "It means that even on a hot summer's day, they will be able to see a storm at sea."
