[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A company has admitted killing a six-year-old girl who was crushed to death by electric gates in Manchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cheshire Gates and Automation Limited admitted corporate manslaughter over the death of Semelia Campbell, who died in Moss Side on 28 June 2010.
She became trapped between the gate and a wall outside her home.
No evidence was offered at Manchester Crown Court over company director Kriston Kearns, 43, who was cleared of manslaughter.
Cheshire Gates and Automation Ltd will be sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on 1 December.
Prosecutor Andrew McGee told the court: "The company would like some time understandably in order to prepare for a sentencing hearing."
Police were called to Maine Road, Manchester, to reports of a child trapped against a brick gatepost by a heavy, sliding gate at the entrance to the residents' car park on the newly built estate.
Officers found Semelia had been crushed and found the electronic gate to be stuck fast in the closed position.
She was released after the considerable efforts of emergency services but died a short while later in hospital.
Her mother, Judith Gilroy, and family visited Downing Street to hand in a petition calling for safety measures to prevent another tragedy.
