Senior police official Tariq Dharejo said: "We have deployed some police at Moin's residence for security reasons as people were causing disturbances."
The former test captain has apologised for his actions.
"I went to the casino to have dinner with some friends but in hindsight it was an inappropriate judgement on my part given the disappointment in the team's performance at the World Cup," said Khan, who was ordered home by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
