[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough's Glen Durrant says Sunday's BDO World Championship success against Danny Noppert is in the top three moments of his life.

The number one seed, 46, beat Dutchman Noppert 7-3 at Lakeside.
Durrant had never won the competition before, reaching the semi-finals in 2015 and the last eight a year later.
"It's the biggest achievement by a country mile, it's up there with my wedding day and the birth of my daughter," Durrant told BBC Tees.
"That was probably my moment in life. I'm a two-time World Master, two-time Zuiderduin Masters champion, I've won 20 titles over the last three years and now I'm the Lakeside champion. Nobody can take that away from me."
Durrant's signature celebration is the 'Duzza Shuffle', although in this biggest triumph he was too overcome with emotion to deliver the big finish.
"There was absolute ecstasy when I hit the winning double," Durrant added. "If he didn't hit the 180, and it left a six-dart finish, I'd have finished with the shuffle.
"But he did hit the 180, I went for 48 and that first dart could have gone anywhere, my legs and body were like jelly.
"When it went in double 16. my favourite, it was a bit dramatic but it's how I felt."
