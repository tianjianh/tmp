£1m home improvement boost in Denbigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Almost 110 homes in a Denbighshire town are to receive external wall insulation to boost energy efficiency after the county council secured a £1m Welsh government grant.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A mix of council and private properties in Denbigh are set to receive upgrades at Smithfield Road, Lon Llewelyn, Myddleton Avenue and Maes Glas Avenue.
Councillor Barbara Smith, lead member for housing, said the work normally costs Denbighshire council up to £10,000 but the grant had reduced its contribution to less than £3,000.
