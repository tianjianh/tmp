Lynne Freeman, 46, was found seriously injured outside a house in Maple Crescent, Redcar, on Wednesday evening.
Minutes later, police received reports that Jodie Betteridge, 30, was being attacked in nearby Byland Close.
Cleveland Police said magistrates had granted an extension to question a 34-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of two counts of murder.
A force spokeswoman said the families of the women were being supported by specially-trained officers.
Both scenes, which are less than a mile apart, remain cordoned off.
The police spokeswoman added: "Following the arrest of a 34-year-old man in relation to the murder of two women in the Redcar area, police attended Teesside Magistrates' Court where they were authorised an extension of his detention.
"This allows the investigation team to detain the man for a further period of time while they continue their inquiries.
"A post mortem examination has taken place regarding one victim and the post mortem examination for the other victim is due to take place later."
Neighbours described the deaths as "very shocking".
A floral tribute for Ms Betteridge, left near the scene at Byland Close, had a note which said "thoughts are with your beautiful children".
