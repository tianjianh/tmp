Philipp Hofmann: Brentford striker signs for SpVgg Greuther Furth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford striker Philipp Hofmann has joined German second-tier side Greuther Furth for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Germany Under-21 international Hofmann joined Brentford from Kaiserslauten for an undisclosed fee in July 2015.
The 24-year-old featured in only 33 games in two seasons with the Championship club, scoring four goals.
"It is a move that is in the best interests of all parties," co-director of football Phil Giles said.
"It is fair to say that things haven't worked out as well as either Philipp or Brentford would have hoped since he signed in 2015.
"We were therefore keen to find a new club for Philipp to give him a fresh start and a chance to play games."
