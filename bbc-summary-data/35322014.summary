Footbridge solution for flood-divided Tadcaster

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A footbridge is to be constructed to reunite a North Yorkshire town divided after its main road bridge collapsed during flooding.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Initial plans to bridge the River Wharfe in Tadcaster resulted in a stalemate after a local landowner refused permission.
The county council said an alternative option had been found using land owned by the town and district councils.
The authority said it hoped the bridge would be in place "within weeks".
The 18th Century road bridge is expected to take up to 12-months to repair at a cost of £3m.
The government had offered the county council an additional £300,000 towards the cost of a temporary footbridge to help reunite the town whilst the repairs are carried out.
Samuel Smiths' brewery, which owned the site originally chosen, refused permission over concerns pressure might be exerted for the temporary bridge to remain after the road bridge was reopened.
The county council said a new agreement had been reached between it, the town council, Selby district council and the town's football club, Tadcaster Albion.
The bridge will be accessed from Selby District Council's car park on the east side of the river and lead on to land owned by the town council on the west side.
The access path will lead through Tadcaster Albion's car park, which will provide a disabled access route.
There is an alternative route directly onto Bridge Street for the more able bodied.
The authority said it was grateful to the football club for its' help and would be making "every effort to get the footbridge installed as quickly as possible."
The town's MP, Nigel Adams, who had raised the issue with the prime minister on Tuesday, said he was delighted a solution had been found.
