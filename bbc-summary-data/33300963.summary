Whiterock parade passes peacefully

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The annual Whiterock parade in west Belfast has passed off peacefully.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Orange Order complied with a Parades Commission restriction on the number of people who could walk on to the mainly nationalist Springfield Road, at the junction with Workman Avenue.
About 50 residents from the Springfield Residents Action Group held a silent protest along the short stretch.
More than 100 police officers were present.
PSNI Ch Supt Nigel Grimshaw said he was "encouraged by the calm and peaceful way in which the parade and associated protests were conducted".
He added: "I want to commend those involved for their efforts in ensuring the day was a success."
