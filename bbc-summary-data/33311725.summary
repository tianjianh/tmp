Skye school closures decision overturned

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new panel set up to review school closure plans has, for the first time, overturned a decision by a Scottish council to shut schools in its area.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Highland Council had wanted to close Edinbane, Dunvegan, Knockbreck and Struan primaries and construct a new school at Dunvegan on Skye.
Scottish ministers called in the proposal in May for consideration by a school closure review panel.
The panel said the council had not fulfilled its legal obligations.
Highland Council said it was disappointed by the decision. It has 14 days to lodge an appeal.
The council had argued there would be educational and community benefits as well as cost savings.
However, some parents objected, saying their children faced lengthy journeys to and from school.
Drew Millar, Highland Council's education, children and adult services committee chairman, said: "We undertook an extensive consultation, taking account of the ideas and aspirations expressed by all of those involved.
"We listened to parents when we came to our decision, and we sought to accommodate the range of views.
"Many parents will share our disappointment and we shall now take stock and consider the options, including whether the council will lodge an appeal."
The review panel has the last say on school closures after changes were brought in through last year's Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014.
Previously if Scottish government ministers "called in" a local authority proposal to close a school they would also then make a final decision in relation to the closure.
The panel was set up to try to give parents more confidence in the system at a local and national level and try to end any suggestion that decisions by ministers to block closures could have been politically motivated.
The panel cannot overturn a council's decision simply because it sympathises with the concerns of opponents of a closure or feels a council ultimately made the wrong choice.
It has to believe the process followed was in some way flawed - for instance because incorrect procedures were followed.
As such, it is inevitable that a decision like this risks being embarrassing locally for Highland Council as well as a huge victory for the people trying to save their local schools.
