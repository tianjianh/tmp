The 61-year-old, who has managed five clubs in the Premier League, was named Roy Hodgson's successor on Friday.
"I think I'm the right age with the right experience," he told the Football Association's FATV.
"Hopefully I can pass on a lot of knowledge and experience to the team and get a very happy camp that becomes a very successful one."
Former Bolton centre-half Allardyce maintained his record of never being relegated from the top flight last term after joining Sunderland in October, losing only one of the final 11 league matches.
Asked what he would bring to the England job, he said: "Man-management, I think.
"Many, many years accumulating great coaching techniques and, yes, accumulating sports science ideas, which everybody knows has been one of my biggest adventures from 2000-01 when I took Bolton into the Premier League."
Allardyce's first competitive fixture as England manager will be a World Cup qualifying match in Slovakia on 4 September.
He has yet to announce who will be in his team of assistants but spoke of creating a backroom staff "that delivers a great service in all areas and departments".
He added: "You have to manage that, not just manage players but manage staff, to delegate to them and to give confidence to produce the qualities they have which are actually better qualities than me.
"I love finding a person with greater qualities than me in their department and promoting their strengths.
"That gives me greater strength to do my job."
