The staff at Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), an arms-length council body, want better pay for shift work.
About 140 members of three trade unions -  Unison, Unite and GMB  - are expected to take part in the 48-hour action from 9 to 11 September.
Ahead of previous stoppages this year, CSG said it had "business continuity plans in place".
Unison Glasgow branch secretary Brian Smith said: "The trade unions believe that the payment levels are far too low compared to those in other parts of the Glasgow City Council family.
"For example, the nightshift payment in the council is almost double that which CSG intend to pay.
"The trade unions do not believe that the proposed payments adequately compensate workers who undertake shifts and our members have been left with no option other than to take strike action."
