A rare glimpse of the nesting habits of a colony of one of the UK's rarest seabirds is being captured on camera on a Denbighshire beach.

Images of the little terns at Gronant Dunes, near Prestatyn, are being gathered for an exhibition to showcase the birds.
There are 136 breeding pairs on the beach, the last remaining colony in Wales.
They return each April from Africa to nest in the dunes on the Dee estuary.
Volunteers cover shifts between 04:00-22:00 BST to protect them from predators.
Denbighshire Countryside Service is working with professional photographer David Woodfall from Denbigh to record their lives for a future exhibition.
