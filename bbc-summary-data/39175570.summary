[SN]TITLE[SN]
Labour 'confident' Jeremy Corbyn paid right amount of tax

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Labour has said it is "confident" that Jeremy Corbyn has paid the correct amount of tax.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party's leader published his tax return as part of a call for transparency from politicians.
The return appeared to show his MP salary, plus pension payments, but not the money he is entitled to as leader of the opposition.
However, the party said the allowance of £27,192 was included in the tax return and was taxed at source.
The return records Mr Corbyn's "pay from all employments" as £77,019 - mostly from his MP's salary of £74,000 - along with a pension of £36,045, £1,200 from self-employment and £78 in interest.
He paid income tax of £35,298 for the year 2015-16, after becoming Labour leader in September 2015.
A Labour source was initially unable to say why Mr Corbyn's leader's salary was missing from the return, which was prepared by accountants.
But later a Labour spokesman said it was "untrue" that the leadership payment had been omitted.
They said it was included in the full return under the heading of "public office".
"We are confident the total income of £114,342 in the tax return is correct, as is the income tax charge of £35,298. Nearly all the tax was paid at source.
"We welcome media and public scrutiny of the Labour leader's tax return. This is a matter of policy, not political point scoring.
"We believe in transparency. Those who seek the highest office, along with the very wealthy and powerful, should publish their tax returns."
The publication came after Chancellor Phillip Hammond declined a challenge to publish his own taxes, calling it "demonstration politics".
Speaking to The BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said: "I have no intention of doing so. Just for the record my tax affairs are all perfectly regular and up to date.
"But I think this demonstration politics isn't helping the atmosphere in British politics."
