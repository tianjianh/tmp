[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mother whose son was killed by a driver using a hands-free phone is calling for a total ban on mobile use for drivers.

Seth Dixon, seven, was hit by a car driven by a woman while she was chatting to a friend using her mobile phone's loudspeaker function, in 2014.
Seth's mother, Alice Husband, has launched a petition.
The government said current legislation means drivers distracted by the use of hands-free sets can be prosecuted.
Road safety campaigners at the time criticised magistrates - the driver admitted careless driving in the crash at Tydd St Mary, Lincolnshire, and was fined Â£90 and given five points on her licence.

Mrs Husband said driving hands-free could be as bad as drink-driving.
She said: "Research is showing us how it impedes on your driving ability to use a phone hands-free.
"Unlike having a passenger in the seat next to you, it's about the conversation you are having - it takes more thought - and the person at the other end of the phone is not aware of the situation you are in."
In response to Mrs Husband's petition, which has attracted more than 11,500 signatures, the government said it planned to introduce tougher new penalties in 2017.
But it is yet to say whether any changes to legislation will include a ban on hands-free devices.
The government will launch its Think! Campaign next year, aimed at making mobile phone use whilst driving as socially unacceptable as drink driving.
