Britain's Tyson Fury says his world heavyweight title clash with Wladimir Klitschko in Germany on Saturday will be "one of my easiest fights".

Ukrainian Klitschko, 39, defends his WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles against Fury in Dusseldorf's 55,000-capacity Esprit Arena.
"I see so many chinks in his armour. I'm going to expose them very quickly," said Fury, 27, on Tuesday.
Klitschko labelled the Manchester fighter a "colourful" character.

Fury engaged in the traditional stare-down after the news conference, talking to Klitschko throughout.
He complimented him on his appearance and fragrance before making 'bunny ears' in response to the champion telling him to hold his fist up for the cameras.
"I think this will be one of my easiest fights," added Fury.
"It might sound crazy because he's a 'super-champion' and has been world champion for 11 years.
"If I could choose any champion to fight, I'd choose him. I can expose him and you'll see what I mean on Saturday night."
Klitschko, who boasts 64 wins from 67 fights during his career, admitted he will have to overcome the nerves that come before each fight when he faces Fury.
"There have been many fighters along the years that I have faced that were different," he said.
"This time I have a very colourful guy that is young and wants to have the real challenge.
"I heard what he said that he's nervous, which means he's well prepared and alert - because it's good to be nervous."
Late on Monday, Fury said he would pull out of the title clash and even joked he would fight the champion "bare knuckle" if an agreement over gloves for the fight is breached.
Klitschko stipulated the type of gloves for the bout, but Fury found an initial test pair from the manufacturer uncomfortable, though preferred a second, slightly different pair.
Listen to Klitschko v Fury live on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:30 GMT on Saturday, 28 November.
