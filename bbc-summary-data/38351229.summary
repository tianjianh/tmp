Video replays: Fifa president Gianni Infantino defends use during Club World Cup

Using video replays to review decisions at the Club World Cup has produced "extremely positive results", says Fifa president Gianni Infantino.

The system was first used on Wednesday to award a penalty in Kashima Antlers' 3-0 win over Atletico Nacional, with the referee alerted by his assistant.
Marco van Basten, Fifa's chief officer of technical development, said the decision "took a few seconds too much".
But Infantino said "transparency and justice have been brought to the game".
Replays were again used as Real Madrid beat Club America 2-0 in the semi-finals on Thursday.
Referee Enrique Caceres briefly asked for a consultation before allowing Cristiano Ronaldo's late goal to stand.
"In the end it was good and the right decision was made," said former Netherlands striker Van Basten. "Only the communication between the video assistant referee and the referee was not optimum."
Video assistant referees have assisted officials during two international friendlies this year, but the Club World Cup represents their first use in Fifa competition.
Previous usage has been in what Fifa call a "semi-live" scenario, where the referee was not able to review decisions on a pitchside monitor.
