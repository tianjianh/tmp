[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Troubled NFL quarterback Johnny Manziel is expected to be charged over an alleged assault on his ex-girlfriend.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A lawyer for the former Cleveland Browns quarterback told the Associated Press news agency that prosecutors had told him a charge was coming.
A Texas grand jury has agreed a misdemeanour assault charge for family violence, the lawyer said.
Colleen Crowley says he confronted her at a Dallas hotel and hit her as they drove back to Fort Worth.
The Class A misdemeanour carries up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.
Lawyer Robert Hinton told AP the charge was expected on Tuesday and he expected a judge to set bail.
Despite success playing football as a university student, Manziel - nicknamed "Johnny Football" - has struggled with substance abuse and personal issues in the professional league.
Manziel was released from Cleveland Browns in March.
