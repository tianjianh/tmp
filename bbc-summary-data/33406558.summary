The collision happened just after 09:20 BST in North Street, Brighton, close to the clock tower, Sussex Police said.
Eighteen people were taken to hospitals in Brighton and Haywards Heath. Five will remain in hospital overnight.
Police said part of their investigation into the incident would focus on whether the driver became ill before the crash.
Initially, the emergency services said two people had suffered life-threatening injuries, but Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals officials later adjusted the casualty figures.
The Kent, Surrey and Sussex air ambulance landed next to Brighton Pavilion and one patient was treated by the onboard doctor before being taken to the Royal Sussex County Hospital.
As well as the most seriously injured patient, seven others have what are described as major injuries and 10 have minor injuries.
Twelve people were treated at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton and six in the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath, 20 miles away.
Aaron Tierney, who lives just near the crash site, said: "I heard a big bang and looked out the window to see two buses crashed into each other.
"I could see the driver of one of the buses stuck in his seat. There were a lot of people around him, including ambulance services. They had to cut him out.
"One of the other bus drivers looked really upset. I saw a few other people, mainly elderly, being helped off the bus.
"People were bringing out chairs and water for them from the shops nearby."
Two students who passed first aid exams only two weeks ago found themselves at the centre of the drama.
Zoe Dellow and Ellie Vinehall ran to the scene after hearing the crash.
They said one driver was trapped in his cab, with the steering wheel against his chest. A second man had a deep head wound.
Ms Dellow said: "He was drifting in and out of consciousness... we had to try to keep him awake."
After emergency services arrived the students helped other casualties using a first aid kit supplied by staff from the nearby Sainsbury's store. They said the casualties had suffered minor injuries.
Ms Vinehall said: "We're so pleased that we've done our first aid because there was nobody else qualified in first aid there."
Ms Dellow said: "We only did it two weeks ago. It makes you realise - don't take life for granted."
Martin Harris, managing director of Brighton and Hove Buses, said an investigation was under way.
