The 19-year-old man, from Newick, East Sussex, was arrested in February on suspicion of causing aggravated harassment, alarm or distress.
Price published a message she received, which featured images mocking her 14-year-old son, Harvey.
The man was cautioned by Sussex Police on Thursday after answering bail.
Harvey, who is partially blind, autistic and has Prader-Willi syndrome, is the son of the 38-year-old TV personality and former footballer Dwight Yorke.
In January, Price tweeted out the offensive manipulated image in an effort to find the person behind the editing.
She said: "Caught out!! Another bully on our hands. Anyone know this guy??"
In March, she set up petition calling for online abuse to be made a specific criminal offence and for the creation of a register of offenders.
So far it has more than 213,000 signatures.
She wrote on the petition description: "Trolling is a major problem in this day and age. People of all ages and background suffer every day, including my family - especially my son Harvey.
"I have tried my best to expose people and even had two arrested but nothing was done and there were no repercussions or penalties for this behaviour."
