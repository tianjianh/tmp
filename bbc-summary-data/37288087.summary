Police investigating the attempted kidnap of an RAF airman by two men have had 30 calls after the case featured on BBC Crimewatch on Monday.

The married airman in his late 20s was out running near RAF Marham in Norfolk on 20 July when he was ambushed by two men, but he managed to escape.
E-fits of the suspects led to some callers putting names to the faces.
Police said they were now following up these leads.
The airman, who has not been identified, said he was grabbed on Squires Hill by a man who tried to drag him towards a nearby car.
He fought back, knocking one to the ground, before the pair fled in a dark-coloured people carrier.

Norfolk Police made fresh appeals for information on Crimewatch and showed CCTV footage of cars travelling to and from a nearby shop, which they hope will trigger people's memories.
They have also released a picture of a knife similar to one that one of the attackers had.
Det Supt Paul Durham said: "People have put names to the e-fit images they've seen, we've had sightings of vehicles and this all goes into mix and all those lines of inquiry will be followed up.
"The airman is not back to work yet - he's had a period of extended leave - but he's doing fine and will be returning to work in the not too distant future.
"I'm confident we can solve this, but it is going to take some time."
