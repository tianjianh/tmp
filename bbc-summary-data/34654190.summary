The United States won gold for their third consecutive women's team title, while China took silver.
The Americans produced an error-free performance on the four apparatus of vault, uneven bars, beam and floor to score 181.338 points.
China accumulated 176.164 points, with Great Britain scoring 172.380.
The British team of Becky Downie, Ruby Harrold, Amy Tinkler, Claudia Fragapane, Ellie Downie and Kelly Simm were out of the medals going into their final vault apparatus.
But three terrific vaults by Claudia Fragapane, Amy Tinkler and Ellie Downie helped GB leapfrog Russia, who put in patchy beam and floor performances.
The younger Downie sister's final vault of 15.133 came after she fell off her first apparatus on uneven bars.
The 16-year-old, though, regained her composure to score well on beam and floor before her decisive vault under pressure.
"It was an amazing experience, it was so nice to be able to achieve this success in front of a home crowd as well," said her sister Becky, 23.
"It just makes it that much more special for us all to know how much it means to the supporters. The future for British Gymnastics is really exciting, so we have a lot to look forward to."
Tinkler, another World Championships debutant - and celebrating her 16th birthday - also showed incredible maturity on both floor and vault.
Fragapane (floor, beam and vault), Becky Downie (bars and beam) and Ruby Harrold (bars) also made important contributions.
GB women's previous World Championships team best was fifth in Tokyo in 2011.
On Wednesday, Britain's men will compete in their team final, having qualified third.
