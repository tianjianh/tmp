HÃ©lÃ¨ne Turon, an economics lecturer at Bristol University, was subjected to remarks made on a social media site.
The comments are said to include sexual innuendo and derogatory remarks about her teaching.
In a statement, the university said it takes "cyber-bullying very seriously, whether the victim is a student or a member of staff".
It added that students "involved in such activities would be dealt with under our disciplinary procedures".
The comments were made on the social media Yik Yak which allows users to anonymously post comments on discussions in their locality.
The story was reported by Bristol University student newspaper The Tab.
The publication reported that Ms Turon chastised her first-year students, explaining how she was concerned her teenage children could have seen the comments, before walking out.
She told the paper there is a "difference between public and private gossip" and there should be a discussion about "what the appropriate amount of respect students should have for staff and fellow students is".
Kin Knappett, president of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said it has "seen an increase in cyber bullying" amongst its members.
She added: "Young people think they have a free range to say what they want, how they want and where they want, without thinking about how it will affect anyone else."
The union is calling for better education around the issue of cyber bullying and the "long-term implications" of online comments.
Paul Bridge, University and College Union head of higher education, said they "strongly condemn any form of bullying against staff or student".
He added that victims of cyber bullying "experience the same feelings of fear, intimidation, stress, low morale as other forms of bullying and all steps must be taken to ensure cases are reported and fully investigated".
