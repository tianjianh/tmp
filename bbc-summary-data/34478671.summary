Wick Quarry restoration plan gets go ahead

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to convert a quarry into a nature reserve have been given the go ahead.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wick Quarry is currently used to mine limestone and the site in South Gloucestershire has permission to operate until 2042.
South Gloucestershire Council also voted to approve outline plans for a warden's lodge, greenhouse, poly-tunnel barns, workshops and offices.
The application will now be referred to the secretary of state as the site is located in the Green Belt.
He would determine whether they wish to call the application in for consideration.
A council spokesman said the restoration is estimated to create around 70 to 80 jobs over the lifetime of the project.
A number of conditions were also attached to the application.
