Police said the man targeted the woman after visiting her on Tuesday morning in Moss Side.
The woman tried to escape by agreeing to walk with him and her two dogs in Alexandra Park, officers said.
A friend of the woman later called the police. The man is described as Asian or mixed race, in his 30s or 40s and was wearing dark clothing and a hat.
Police have appealed for two people who were asked for a lighter by the man in the park to come forward.
