Helen Ward's long-range shot evaded keeper Carly Telford and nestled in the top left corner to give the visitors the lead after only seven minutes.
The hosts equalised through Clarke's penalty after Fern Whelan handled in the box, but Kirsty McGee's header restored Reading's lead.
Clarke's deft lob on 64 minutes meant both side's settled for a point.
The result means both teams are still looking for their first league win of the season.
