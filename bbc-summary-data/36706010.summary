Scotland Under-21 cap McGhee, 19, is poised to spend a season with Boro's development squad after playing 28 times for Hearts last season.
The 25-year-old Noring, who has one cap for Sweden, was with Lyngby in the Danish top flight last season.
Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson said: "He has everything we're looking for."
The Edinburgh club released Neil Alexander this summer despite the former Scotland squad goalkeeper being first choice for most of last season.
As the 38-year-old moved on to Scottish Premiership rivals Aberdeen as a player-coach, Hearts signed Paul Gallacher from Partick Thistle to fill that role at Tyncecastle.
Neilson said that 22-year-old Jack Hamilton, who was recently called up to the senior Scotland squad for the first time, was ready to become his first choice.
But Noring, who started his career with Trelleborgs and had loan spells with Malmo and Celtic before joining Bodo/Glimt then Heerenveen, is poised to challenge the young Scot.
"We offered Viktor a contract, so he's away back to Sweden to speak to his agent and his family and we're hoping to hear back from him in the next couple of days," said Neilson of Noring, who played nine times for Lyngby.
"We think he can challenge Jack Hamilton for the number one spot and that's what we want. I want someone to push him on and compete."
Meanwhile, McGhee is poised to be given the chance to win a permanent transfer to Middlesbrough, with the club promoted to England's Premier League continuing their interest in the product of Hearts' youth academy.
"Middlesbrough have come back in wanting to take Jordan on a loan deal," Neilson told Sky Sports.
"It was something that came up in the January window and it broke down at the last minute and Jordan's had his heart set on it since then.
"The last year or two, he's been desperate to get down to England and, with Middlesbrough coming back in and, with Jordan's desire to play down there, it was the right thing to do.
"Middlesbrough are looking to recruit younger players into their development squad and Jordan will go down there and try to push himself into the first team."
McGhee made his Hearts debut aged 16 in 2013, but only 15 of his 28 appearances last season were in the starting line-up.
He was travelling to Middlesbrough on Monday and will not feature in the second leg of Hearts' Europa League qualifier against Infonet in Estonia on Wednesday.
However, midfielder Morgaro Gomis and striker Robbie Muirhead will both travel after being passed fit following minor injury complaints.
Midfielder Don Cowie will remain in Edinburgh to work on his recovery from a calf injury.
