Gunn crashed 15 fours and two sixes while Georgia Elwiss (81) and Alison Davidson-Richards (77 no) contributed to a massive 397-4 from 50 overs.
Gaby Lewis top-scored with 28 as Ireland were skittled out for 103 in reply, with Anya Shrubsole and Alex Hartley each taking three wickets.
The sides meet again on Wednesday.
The game was played in temperatures touching 40C.
Laura Delany's young Irish side acquitted themselves well in the early stages of the England innings, and at 229-4 in the 34th over they had ambitions of restricting their opponents to below 300.
However, Gunn's powerful 94 from 52 balls, adding 150 in just 16 overs with Davidson-Richards, saw England set a daunting target.
Sixteen-year-old debutant Lara Maritz was the pick of the Irish attack, taking 1-51 in a nine-over spell, while the other wicket takers were Laura Boylan (1-39) and Rachel Delaney (1-49).
In reply Ireland struggled against an experienced and penetrative England attack, with Shrubsole (3-11) and Hartley (3-24) boasting impressive figures.
Lewis, also just 16, hit four boundaries in her 28 as the Irish were dismissed in the 44th over.
