When your toys need new batteries, it's usually not too difficult to replace them with some new ones.

But what happens when you need to put new batteries onto the International Space Station (ISS)?
Well, you need to send some astronauts on a spacewalk, of course!
On Friday, two astronauts - French astronaut Thomas Pesquet and American astronaut Shane Kimbrough - walked out into space from the ISS to upgrade the power systems on the outside of it.
The walk was planned to take six and half hours to give them time to fix new batteries, which are the size of fridges, to the side of the station.
Have a watch of their spacewalk above!
