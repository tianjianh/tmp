Police said the discovery was made on Sunday evening in a secluded area of Torvean Quarry.
The remains appear to have been there for several months or longer, Police Scotland said.
The force added that the identity, age and sex of the deceased person were unknown at this stage and the death was being treated as "unexplained".
In a statement, police said: "It is not known how the person died, a post mortem will be held and the death is being treated as unexplained.
"The tent was in a secluded area of the quarry and was a distance away from paths used by the public.
"It appears that the person had been living in this tent for a period of time and it is likely he or she would have been seen by people nearby."
