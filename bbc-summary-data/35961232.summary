[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A file of evidence against a man suspected of murdering a schoolgirl almost 40 years ago has been submitted to prosecutors, the BBC has learnt.

Robert Black - who died in prison in January - killed four young girls and was believed to have murdered 13-year-old Genette Tate in Devon in 1978.
Devon and Cornwall Police said the file runs to "scores of pages".
Genette's body has not been found since she vanished while delivering evening newspapers in Aylesbeare, near Exeter.
Her case is believed to be the longest running missing person inquiry in Britain.
Black, originally from Grangemouth in Scotland, was first convicted of sexual assault when he was a teenager and the delivery driver's murder victims came from Northern Ireland, England and Scotland.
He was convicted for killing Jennifer Cardy, nine, of County Antrim in 1981, Susan Maxwell, 11, of Northumberland in 1982, and Caroline Hogg, five, of Edinburgh in 1983 and Sarah Harper, 10, of Leeds, in 1986.
Black died of natural causes in Maghaberry prison, Northern Ireland.
A senior Devon and Cornwall Police source told the BBC: "We would like a clear statement that it [Crown Prosecution Service] would have charged Black with Genette's murder.
"It's the closest we can now get to justice and might offer some comfort to her family and the community."
The new file is the result of two years of work by a dedicated group of eight detectives - including some who worked on the original inquiry - from the force's Major Crime Team.
But, John Tate, Genette's father, said: "It's a shame this file was not submitted earlier to the CPS.
"There was some talk of it being submitted last autumn, then the CPS would have had several months to decide whether to prosecute Black.
"That would have meant that Black would have died in January knowing that he was going to put on trial for Genette's murder."
He added he awaited the "result of the CPS decision with interest".
The BBC has been told the detectives found two new witnesses following a re-investigation of the case, including an examination of the thousands of files from the original investigation.
They have been re-interviewed at length, senior police sources said, and have "strengthened the circumstantial case against Black".
The witnesses' evidence "concerns Black's behaviour" at the time she disappeared, the sources added.
Black, who was serving a life sentence for the murders of four children, was arrested and questioned in 2005 over the Genette Tate case, but not charged.
The force sent a file to the CPS, but three years later it decided there was insufficient evidence to charge Black.
He denied any involvement in Genette's disappearance.
