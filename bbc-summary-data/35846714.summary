The man posed as a prosecutor and demanded 250,000 rand ($16,400; Â£11,300) in order to "make the case disappear", local media say.
He has now been charged with corruption, according to South Africa police spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi.
Pistorius shot dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February 2013.
The News24 website says that the conman contacted the former Olympic athlete on Thursday night. He was then arrested following a police sting operation.
In a statement, Mr Mulaudzi said: "A 33-year-old man was arrested on Friday afternoon in Pretoria soon after he received a deposit of 40,000 rand for his services which included... [having] Oscar Pistorius' murder case destroyed."
Pistorius was found guilty of murdering Ms Steenkamp after a South African appeals court overturned his initial manslaughter verdict in December.
He is due to be sentenced in April.
