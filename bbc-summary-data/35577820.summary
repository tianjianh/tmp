Hawick Knitwear buyer hunt draws a blank so far

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prospective buyer has yet to be found to take over a Borders knitwear firm as a going concern.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blair Nimmo, of administrators KPMG, confirmed no party had been prepared to buy the business and assets at Hawick Knitwear in their current format.
The company called in administrators nearly six weeks ago after experiencing "difficult trading conditions".
More than 100 staff were made redundant immediately with just 56 workers retained to complete remaining orders.
Mr Nimmo said discussions were continuing with various parties who had offered to acquire the assets of the company and may at some point start production from the Hawick Knitwear premises.
He added: "However until a formal agreement is concluded we are not in a position to provide further information."
