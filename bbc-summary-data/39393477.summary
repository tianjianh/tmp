Andrew Balbirnie has replaced injured Kevin O'Brien in the Ireland squad for next week's Intercontinental Cup game against Afghanistan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
All-rounder O'Brien suffered a hamstring injury in the recent one-day series against Afghanistan and will return to Ireland for treatment.
Balbirnie played in the one-day series and his 85 not out helped Ireland win the third match.
Ireland levelled the series before Afghanistan won Friday's decisive game.
The Irish top the Intercontinental Cup table having won all four of their matches in the competition to date.
Afghanistan are in second place on 61 points - 19 behind the Irish - heading into the four-day game which starts on Tuesday.
