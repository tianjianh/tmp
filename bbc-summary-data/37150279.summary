The Aspar Ducati rider from Toomebridge has moved on to 63 points and lies 11th in the 2016 standings.
Laverty has scored points in 10 of the 11 rounds this season with a best finish of fourth in Argentina in April.
Britain's Cal Crutchlow took his maiden MotoGP win with Valentino Rossi second and Marc Marquez of Spain in third.
Crutchlow's hard tyres suited the testing conditions in Brno and he worked his way from 10th on the grid to take the lead with seven laps to go.
He is the first Briton to win an elite-class GP since Barry Sheene in 1981.
Laverty crashed out on the final corner of the last lap while in 11th place in the previous round in Austria.
The next race is the British GP at Silverstone on 4 September.
