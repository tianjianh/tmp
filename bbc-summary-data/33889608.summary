Parts of the Trent Basin in Colwick, mainly an industrial area, have stood derelict for more than a decade.
Now developers Blueprint have started building the first 45 energy efficient properties and are considering continental-style floating homes.
The city council, which part owns the firm, said it hopes this will kick-start a wider regeneration of the area.
Plans are for about 400 houses and apartments set round green spaces and the old dock.
Nick Ebbs, the chief executive of Blueprint, said: "Imagine a new residential neighbourhood but think continental examples, not suburban but not dense urban, the sort of thing you would find in Amsterdam or Copenhagen.
"(For the dock) we are looking at the possibility of floating homes and of course people using it for leisure.
"There is a lot of industry here still but there are other developers working and in 10 to 15 years the aspiration is for 3,000 homes, it will be transformed."
Graham Chapman, deputy leader of the city council, said: "We have control of a lot of this land and we haven't had that before.
"For a long time land prices meant the only viable development was high-rise flats and we didn't want that."
