Four people were taken to hospital on Thursday after a three-vehicle accident in the early hours near the A40 turn for Oxford (junction 8).
On Saturday, a car ended up on its roof on a verge after a four-vehicle crash at junction 10 at 15:22 GMT.
John Callaway from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said it was "remarkable" that no-one was killed.
He added it was the seventh road accident his Banbury team had been called to in under a week.
Mr Callaway said: "This was a high-speed collision on a fast road, it is remarkable that nobody lost their life.
"Out of the four casualties, two were transferred to hospital by ambulance and two were treated at the scene. Fortunately none of the injuries appear life-threatening.
"With the onset of winter and more difficult driving conditions, I urge drivers to allow more time for their journey and adjust their driving accordingly."
