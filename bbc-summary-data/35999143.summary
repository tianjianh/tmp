IBF heavyweight champion Charles Martin says he will stop British challenger Anthony Joshua in Saturday's title fight at London's O2 Arena.

Martin, 29, weighed in at 17st 7lbs, a pound heavier than his British rival.
"I'm going to break him down and stop him," said American Martin, who is unbeaten in 24 contests.
Joshua, who has won all 15 of his bouts by knockout, responded: "I'm not here to be part of the show, I'm here to make an impact."
The 26-year-old Briton, who won Olympic super-heavyweight gold in 2012, added on Friday: "I have a few butterflies of course but I'll just rest tonight and let you know how I feel tomorrow.
"I see myself outclassing him. I feel good, I feel loose. I'm getting better and better."

Joshua's compatriot David Haye squared up to American heavyweight Shannon Briggs at the weigh-in - and later said the pair would fight if they came through their respective bouts on 21 May.
Haye, 35, faces Swiss fighter Arnold Gjergjaj at the O2 Arena, with former WBO champion Briggs, 44, expected to be on the undercard.
"If he wins that fight and passes the medical then I'll knock him out afterwards," Haye told Sky Sports.
