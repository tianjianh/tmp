Gethin Davies ends 64-year association with eisteddfod

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who has been involved in an annual world music festival in Denbighshire is stepping down after a 64-year association with the event.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gethin Davies began as a programme seller for the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod in 1951 and went on to be its only two-time chairman.
He also worked as an usher and festival secretary and his wife, Eulanwy, has served as musical director.
Mr Davies said: "I'm moving out of the way after 45 years on the board."
The retired solicitor, 76, was born in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, and moved to Llangollen when his father became head of the secondary modern school in the town.
His first term as chairman began in 1992 and he was in post for Luciano Pavarotti's return in 1995, before standing down in 2003. He stepped up again in 2013 but retired this week.
