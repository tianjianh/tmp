Officials from Scottish Borders Council and the Scottish Futures Trust were also due to be in attendance.
Mr Moore, who represents Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, was scheduled to meet Vodafone, O2, EE, Three, Arqiva, Airwave and Ofcom in Westminster.
He wants them to tackle so-called "not spots" in the south east of Scotland.
"Improving the communications infrastructure in the Borders is essential and through the Borders Digital Forum I have been working on this issue over a number of years," he said.
"4G is the latest generation of voice and data which is already widely available elsewhere in the country.
"Meanwhile, many areas of the Borders have limited or no voice and data services at all."
He said mobile companies had to "live up to their obligations to tackle poor service in rural areas like the Borders".
"There have been welcome initiatives from individual companies recently, but much more is needed," he said.
"I look forward to having a constructive dialogue with each company and I look forward to them taking decisive steps to improve the service we receive in the Borders.
"Poor mobile phone signal is damaging the local economy and extremely frustrating for local people, it is absolutely vital that we see a significant improvement in coverage, as soon as possible."
