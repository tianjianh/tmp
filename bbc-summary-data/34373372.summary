Wahlberg, who hosted the event in Philadelphia - dubbed the Festival of Families - said he owed all his success to "my Catholic faith".
"My faith has given me the ability to be a good father, a good husband and... a good person," he told the crowd.
He later said he hoped God "has a sense of humour" when considering his movies.
A 14-year-old choirboy, who sang Pie Jesu early in the evening, stopped to greet  Wahlberg on his way off the stage.
"That, right there, was truly the voice of an angel," said Wahlberg, "but then he whispered in my ear that he loved the movie Ted... and I told him that was not appropriate for his age," Wahlberg joked to the crowd.
"Holy Father," he added, addressing the pontiff, "please forgive me. I've always hoped that the good Lord has a sense of humour when it comes, and pertains, to many of the movies that I've made."
Pope Francis later took to the stage to speak to the 300,000-strong who turned out to watch the open-air event.
"Families quarrel and sometimes plates can fly and children bring headaches, and I won't speak about mothers-in-law," he said.
"But those difficulties are overcome with love," he added, concluding: "Never let the day end without making peace."
Ahead of the Pope's arrival, Sister Sledge opened the festival with a rendition of 'We Are Family'. The 1970s disco group said their signature hit was "a perfect fit for His Holiness Pope Francis".
Grammy winner Franklin performed Amazing Grace - and returned to the stage towards the end of the evening for a surprise rendition of opera classic Nessun Dorma - while Italian star Bocelli performed The Lord's Prayer', accompanied by The Philadelphia Orchestra and the Philadelphia Heritage Chorale.
Folk singer Marie Miller, American rock band The Fray and Colombian pop star Juanes also performed.
The Festival marked the Pope's final evening in the US, with his six-day visit concluding on Sunday.
