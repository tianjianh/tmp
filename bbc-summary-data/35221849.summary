The Gambian, 27, joined the Terriers in August and scored three goals in 15 appearances, with his last goal coming in Saturday's 2-0 win at Bolton.
Town boss David Wagner told the club website: "We have many alternatives in this position; an overload.
"I would like to thank 'Muzza' for his hard work at Huddersfield."
