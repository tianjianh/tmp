County Championship: Adil Rashid helps Yorkshire beat Warwickshire in three days

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
County champions Yorkshire moved into contention for a third straight title as they beat Warwickshire by 48 runs inside three days at Headingley.

Resuming their second innings on 78-5, the Tykes subsided to 150 all out as Bears spinner Jeetan Patel took three of the five wickets to fall.
Set 229 to win, Warwickshire slumped to 14-3 before Jonathan Trott's 59 and Tim Ambrose's 36 added 91 runs.
But, from 105-3, they collapsed to 180, England's Adil Rashid taking 4-29.
The day began well for the Bears when Patel took the first two wickets before Chris Wright nipped in to have both Andrew Hodd and Alex Lees caught behind.
In an already low-scoring game, only three Yorkshire batsmen made double figures in the second innings - and it remained just as hard work for the Warwickshire batsmen second time around.
In the one over before lunch, Andy Umeed was trapped lbw by Sidebottom's fourth delivery before Brooks struck twice after the resumption, trapping both ex-skipper Varun Chopra and current captain Ian Bell in the space of four balls.
Trott and Ambrose gave their side hope but, after they parted in quick succession, the main resistance came from youngster Sam Hain, batting down the order at seven after an earlier collision while fielding.
Hain tripped up on the rope and injured his shoulder crashing into the concrete terracing before being led from the field in obvious pain.
He remained in discomfort during his two-hour vigil, hitting just one four from his 86-ball 34. But, he became Rashid's fourth and final victim when caught at slip in the second over after Yorkshire had claimed the extra half hour.
Victory moves Yorkshire up to third in the table, with a game in hand on most of their rivals, currently nine points behind leaders Middlesex, who may pick up a further five points if their game with Surrey ends in a draw on Sunday. Warwickshire drop to fifth, seven points behind the Tykes.
Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale told BBC Radio Leeds:
"This was a fantastic win. Not many games finish inside three days at Headingley. It was an excellent pitch and tough to bat on. If you put the ball in the right areas, you got your rewards.
"It doesn't often take spin at Headingley but it did in this game. Adil Rashid is ruthless. Not many tail-enders can pick his googly. When you have them six down you bring on Rash the Hoover to get the job done.
"We are now right back in the mix and breathing down Middlesex's neck.  If we have a good run in we can have one of the best Championship years seen for a long time. There is a real buzz around the club now.
"Some clubs have nothing to play for at this stage. We have a chance of three trophies. We now have the attack going that won us the Championship last year. Sidebottom and Brooks are the guys who perform well at Headingley."
Warwickshire director of cricket Dougie Brown told BBC WM:
"I don't know whether it's more disappointing that we simply lost, or that we lost a game that we could have won, had we played the key moments a bit better.
"Yorkshire won those key moments that you get in a close contest between two good teams, a 54-run last-wicket partnership, the 70 from Alex Lees and the way that they bowled.
"But we've not reached 200 in either innings and that's something that's got to be addressed. Some of the dismissals were a bit soft.
"We think Sam Hain possibly dislocated his shoulder. Clearly he was in a lot of pain when when he was out there. We won't know any more until he has it scanned on Monday."
