The victim was on his way home from a night shift when he was struck by a small van on Wednesday, reports said.
CCTV footage circulating on the internet shows several cars driving by without anyone helping, while one man stops - to steal the victim's phone.
The incident has sparked a debate about values and compassion in modern India.
The Delhi government has announced that it will launch a scheme to reward those who come forward to help accident victims.
"It was very sad to know that the people didn't come forward and help the accident victim who lay bleeding on the road. The government has made a scheme to reward people, including auto or taxi drivers, for helping accident victims and rushing them to hospital," the Quint website quotes transport minister Satyendar Jain as saying.
CCTV footage, which has been aired by Indian TV networks, shows the victim being hit as he walks on the side of the road early in the morning.
The driver of the van is seen getting out to see what happened, before driving away.
Later, another man is seen approaching the victim from a rickshaw and stealing his mobile phone before walking off again.
It took almost 90 minutes before police took the heavily bleeding man to hospital, where he was declared dead.
The police said the driver was Rajesh Kumar Gupta, 25, who worked as a milk supplier for a popular brand.
He had been arrested and would be charged under relevant sections of the law, they said, adding that they were also trying to identify the phone thief.
Indian media said the victim, named as Matibool, had been working as a rickshaw driver during the day and as a security guard at night.
On social media, many Indians expressed anger and sadness at the incident, with many describing Delhi as a "heartless city"
