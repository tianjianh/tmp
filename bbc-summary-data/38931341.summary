Bristol artist Luke Jerram is behind the project called Treasure City in which treasures worth at least Â£1,000 each are hidden to be found and kept.
To find the pieces you will need to visit the 20-21 Arts Centre and study five paintings featuring codes, some of which are "extremely hard" to crack.
Mathematician and secret code-setter Dan Fretwell was called in to set the ciphers to encrypt messages telling people where to find the trinkets.
