A 24-year-old man suffered "serious but not life-threatening injuries" in the attack while shopping at the store in Mold at 13:39 GMT on Wednesday.
No-one else was injured during the incident.
A local man was arrested in the store, said North Wales Police.
Police said the store has been closed while crime scene investigators gather evidence and officers speak to witnesses.
The injured man is from Yorkshire.
Det Chief Insp Alun Oldfield said: "Initial indications are this is a racially motivated attack and as such management of the community impact will feature significantly in order to provide public reassurance."
A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said: "We responded with a rapid response vehicle and an emergency ambulance and a man with serious injuries was taken to hospital."
The supermarket said the store was likely to remain closed for the day.
