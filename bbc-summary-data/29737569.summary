Springfields Academy pupil injury case dropped

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who was arrested after a child was seriously injured at a special school in Wiltshire will not face charges after the case was dropped.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The man, who cannot be named, was arrested at Springfields Academy in Calne in October 2013.
Wiltshire Police said they carried out a "complex investigation" but said no criminal charges would be brought.
A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prosecution".
