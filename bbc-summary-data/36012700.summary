The new champ had the joint lowest score on the final day - overtaking favourite to win American Jordan Spieth, who had been leading the competition - to claim golf's famous green jacket.
It's been a very busy week for Danny, who became a dad for the first time last Tuesday.
Willett is only the second Englishman to win the Masters.
