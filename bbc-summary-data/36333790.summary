The 21-year-old underwent hamstring surgery in February after being forced off 10 minutes into his comeback from injury.
Tshibola played regularly under former boss Steve Clarke until picking up a serious ankle injury last October.
"I'm en-route to being back on track when the rest of the boys are back in," said Tshibola.
"It's all positive now. Next season is a big one for myself and everyone at the club.
"The main focus for me now is to keep ticking over and make sure I have a good pre-season," he told the club website.
Royals academy graduate Tshibola spent five months on loan at League Two side Hartlepool in 2015.
Brian McDermott's side finished 17th in the Championship after failing to win any of their final seven matches.
