A legendary rock venue in a south Wales city is being put up for auction.

TJ's in Newport, reputedly where Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain proposed to singer Courtney Love, closed last year after the death of long-term owner John Sicolo.
The building will go up for sale at the Paul Fosh auction at Cardiff's Park Inn Hotel on 15 September at 17:00 BST with a guide price of Â£175,000.
Mr Fosh said the property, in Clarence Place, offered "tremendous potential".
"There's little doubt TJ's was an iconic and well-known rock venue, attracting some major bands especially in the 90s," he said.
"It would be great, romantic even, for someone to buy the building and for it to continue its use as a rock venue, but that sadly seems unlikely to be the case."
He added the building was more likely to be used as residential or retail property, subject to planning.
"I have had a great deal of interest in the property, especially from local people looking to redevelop the property in that way," he said.
