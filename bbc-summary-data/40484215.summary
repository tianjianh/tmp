The sides produced a low-key first half in the game being played at the Belfast venue because the Showgrounds doesn't meet Uefa pitch length requirements.
However, Odd went ahead as Ballymena's Leroy Millar headed a corner into his own net on 79.
Sigurd Haugen tapped in Odd's second goal two minutes from time.
The under-strength Sky Blues went into the game minus injured Kyle Owens and Willie Faulkner while Jim Ervin and Stephen McAlorum were also missing because of pre-arranged holidays.
Canadian player Olivier Occean went close early on for Odd with Ballymena keeper Ross Glendinning making a fine save after an Emmet Friars mistake.
Kevin Braniff tested the Odd keeper Sondre Rossbach before half-time in a contest that had few chances.
Occean was inches away from putting Odd ahead after a John Kitelano cross following the resumption but the visitors did take the lead 11 minutes from time as Kitelano's corner was headed into his own net from six yards by the unfortunate Millar.
Neil Lowry tested Rossbach with a low shot in the 86th minute before Haugen hit Odd's second goal two minutes later.
Odd will meet FC Vaduz in the second qualifying round after the Liechtenstein club completed a 5-1 aggregate success over Welsh outfit Bala Town.
