Liam Lyburd: 'People will die' Newcastle College plot was real

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Callous and calculating would-be killer or attention-seeking loner making empty threats? That was the choice a jury had to make about Liam Lyburd.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 19-year-old had made pipe bombs, assembled a handgun and written graphic messages about attacking Newcastle College and commuters on the Tyne and Wear Metro - killing anyone he came across.
"I'm getting crazier everyday," he wrote on Facebook, adding: "My fantasies are becoming a reality, without question, I'm loosing (sic) my mind. I am going to snap very soon."
But after his arrest, the Tyneside teenager claimed he would never have actually carried out the attacks.
After a day of deliberation, jurors at Newcastle Crown Court decided he did intend to carry out his plans and he was convicted of eight counts of possessing weapons with intent to endanger life.
Lyburd was a danger who "could do anything" according to his neighbour and former friend Ashleigh Stephenson.
She said he was a loner who stalked and trolled girls on Facebook and made threats against people he disagreed with.
She said: "He hated the whole world for no reason, he would definitely have used those weapons.
"He threatened to shoot people out of his window, he sat in his room threatening to kill people because he didn't like his life.
"We all tried to be his friend but he chose not to come out of his house, he made his life by not wanting friends, he's only to blame for it and shouldn't take it out on other people."
Northumbria Police searched the Hamilton Place home Lyburd shared with his mother and sister in November after concerns were raised about posts he was making on Facebook under the name Felix Burns.
In his bedroom they found five pipe bombs, two home-made explosive devices, a 9mm Luger Calibre Glock gun, 94 jacketed hollow point expanding bullets and CS gas, all of which he admitted possessing.
Lyburd told police he had been planning to "shoot a bunch of people" that day.
A black "kill bag" containing a balaclava, safety glasses, elbow and knee pads and pipe bombs with nails taped around them was also found in his room.
Images of Lyburd dressed for combat, armed with a Glock and brandishing a knife were also discovered.
He said it was a Halloween costume.
"People on Halloween dressed as Ghostface from Scream - I don't see it any different from that," he said.
A file called "Newcastle College" was found on Lyburd's computer which read: "You people ruined my whole life don't expect me to show mercy today. No one disrespects me and gets away with it.
"I'll teach you people a little lesson on respect with my 9mm jacketed hollow points.
"It's time for extreme civil disobedience.
"Fantasy will become reality today for sure. Where the mind goes the body will follow and yes people will die there's no question about that."
He had attempted to delete it but computer specialists were able to recover the file.
He blamed Newcastle College - from which he was expelled in 2012 for being disruptive - for giving him a "miserable life".
The note said: "I'll see you in Newcastle College today. It's my first day back since 2012 the year in which my life became miserable after being kicked out for nothing.
"I'll get my power back today haha. I'm just looking forward to getting out of the house after spending three years in my bedroom alone.
"I hold no grudge against Newcastle College - sarcasm. I hold them personally responsible for my miserable life, kicking me out for nothing and making me look a fool by not answering my message on Twitter and Facebook.
"It's funny to think as I'm writing this the people that will die are walking around as if everything is normal, not knowing they're going to die today. It's a beautiful thought."
It was signed Felix Theodore Burns.
His social media accounts paint a picture of a teenager enthralled by violence, guns and death.
According to Facebook, the only book he liked was American Psycho, Bret Easton Ellis' grisly account of a businessman fixated with murder.
Die Hard, Underworld and The Matrix were listed among his favourite films, alongside Tom and Jerry, The Goonies and Bridget Jones' Diary.
Officers found a Skype conversation he had with a girl in Iceland in which he said he would attack people on the Metro while high on Valium, using a machete if his gun jammed.
Lyburd had a morbid fascination with other mass murderers and so-called school killers.
He paid an online tribute to Jaylen Fryberg, the 15-year-old US gunman who shot dead four classmates in Washington state before turning the gun on himself in October last year.
Shortly after the shooting at Marysville High School, Lyburd wrote on Facebook: "If a person treats another like a piece of crap every day don't be surprised if the person comes in shooting. Always be nice to people.
"No-one listens to you when you say you are going to kill people, they only listen to you after you killed the people. No-one takes it seriously anymore.
"RIP Jaylen Fryberg."
He also shared a picture of a corpse with the caption: "Don't pirate movies, they said, go to the premiere, they said."
Beneath the picture he had written "Batman Dark Knight Rises, Premiere...", a reference to the killing of 12 cinema goers in Colorado in 2012.
Lyburd told his trial the posts were a "childish" attempt to "wind people up".
His threatening messages were to keep his Facebook friends interested in him, he said.
On YouTube he viewed and liked multiple instructional videos showing how to load and fire Glock handguns.
Lyburd also uploaded three videos of shootings, under two he wrote "donations welcome" with links to his Bitcoin accounts.
And it was with Bitcoin, a digital currency, that he bought his weapons over the Dark Web under the username Donald Trump.
He said buying the Glock was like "buying a bar of chocolate".
Lyburd only intended to use the gun if someone invaded his home, he claimed.
As with all his claims of innocence, the jury felt otherwise.
He will be sentenced on 25 September.
