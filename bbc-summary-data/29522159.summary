Gogglebox 'sign up' Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So we've called the Channel 4 press team, who won't confirm it, but they wouldn't deny it either.

The news that Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell will appear on Gogglebox is being widely reported.
In fact, if it's not true, the excitement caused by the news could force Channel 4 to actually make it happen.
Who knows they could even make a TV programme about trying to make it happen.
Because if you've never seen Gogglebox it features people sitting in their living rooms watching and reacting to television shows.
Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell probably don't have enough free time to be a weekly feature of the show.
Instead they'll apparently appear in a special episode for charity as part of the station's Stand Up For Cancer night on Friday 17 October.
The supermodels have spent most of their lives being watched and critiqued - so now it could be their turn to do the judging.
Since it first aired in March 2013 Leon and June Bernicoff and Sandra Martin also known as Queen B are some of Gogglebox's best known 'viewers'.
Channel 4's specially themed night in aid of charity will also see a live episode of Alan Carr Chatty Man as well as skits featuring tennis star Andy Murray, singer Taylor Swift and chef Jamie Oliver.
The idea of making a television show about people watching television has been a surprise hit for Channel 4.
Gogglebox is watched on average by almost three million people weekly.
The show won best reality and constructed factual Bafta in 2014.
