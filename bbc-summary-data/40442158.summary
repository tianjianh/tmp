[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is leading a £250m investment to improve grassroots facilities.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Transforming British Tennis Together initiative aims to make the sport more accessible.
Over the next 10 years, it will raise the number of covered and floodlit courts by 50%, refurbish facilities and make courts easier to book online.
The LTA's Alastair Marks said: "We're focused on getting the next generation of players on court and having fun."

The governing body will invest £125m to improve existing community facilities and is hoping to source a further £125m through matched funding.
Only 7% of Britain's 23,000 courts have covers and one in seven park courts have floodlights.
With the new funding, the LTA aims to deliver:
The initiative has been tried out on a trial basis in 10 towns and cities, including Sheffield, where £1.5m was invested and has increased the number of people playing tennis by 54% over the last three years.
Marks, participation director at the LTA, added: "There's never been a better time to invest in making our tennis courts the social hubs of their communities once again."
Clubs and communities can register their interest in bidding for the funding here.
