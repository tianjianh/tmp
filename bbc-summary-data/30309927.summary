The batsman died last Thursday after being hit on the top of his neck during a match for his club side in Sydney.
Cricket fans around the world marked Hughes' death by posting photographs of their bats on Twitter, followed by #putoutyourbats or #putyourbatout.
Paul Taylor from Sydney, who is thought to have started the trend, has said he "couldn't believe" the response it got.
Speaking to 702 ABC in Sydney, he explained how he came up with the idea.
"I was sitting in the lounge room and heard the news of Phillip Hughes' passing and [I was] overcome by grief like most cricket fans were.
"I looked in the corner and there was my bat, sitting there with the hat on. I picked it up and swung it round, upset and thought, 'How are we going to express this?'
"'We as cricketers, who have played, people who play now - how are we all going to do something?'
In what was his first interview since posting the picture online, Mr Taylor said: "I just picked it up and put it outside the front door and placed my cap on it and took a photo of it.
"I thought nothing of it for a little while, and then decided to send it out there, to let people know, 'Hey, this is how I'm feeling.'
"I just can't believe how it took off."
He went on to say that he had been "very reluctant to talk to people because it's not about me".
Mr Taylor said: "It's about Phillip [Hughes] and it's about Shaun [Abbott, the bowler bowled the fatal ball] and the feelings that we have that have come from that."
