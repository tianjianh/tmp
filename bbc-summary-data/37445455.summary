Sian Grigg, from Cardiff, is being recognised as someone who has made a significant contribution to international feature filmmaking.
The announcement was made on Thursday ahead of this year's Bafta Cymru Awards, held on 2 October.
Ms Grigg said it was "a huge honour to be considered and so lovely for one of the creative arts to be recognised".
Previous winners of the Sian Phillips award include director Euros Lyn, writer Russell T Davies and actors Michael Sheen, Rhys Ifans and Ruth Jones.
This will be the first time a make-up artist has received it.
Hannah Raybould, director of Bafta Cymru, said the award was to recognise "Sian's talents and her huge contribution to such an array of films".
Ms Grigg, whose credits include Titanic and The Aviator, received an Academy Award nomination for her work on The Revenant.
Star of the film, Leonardo DiCaprio, called Ms Grigg "a genius".
Bafta Cymru said the special award for outstanding contribution to film and television would go to actor Terry Jones, who was born in Colwyn Bay, Conwy.
A spokesman for the writer, director and former star of Monty Python said: "Terry has been diagnosed with primary progressive aphasia, a variant of frontotemporal dementia.
"This illness affects his ability to communicate and he is no longer able to give interviews. Terry is proud and honoured to be recognised in this way and is looking forward to the celebrations."
