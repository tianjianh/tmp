The 20-year-old moved to Ashton Gate from Wrexham in the summer of 2016 and had a loan spell with League Two side Cheltenham last season.
Smith is yet to make a first-team appearance for Championship club Bristol City.
"Jonny is quick and will run with the ball and gives us different options," said Fylde boss Dave Challinor.
