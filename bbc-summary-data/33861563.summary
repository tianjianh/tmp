Police seized the bright green sports car near their Parkside base in Cambridge on Sunday, after it was spotted missing a front number plate.
It had been rented from a Luton car hire company, which has also received a summons.
The Huracan model retails from about Â£180,000.
Officers from Cambridgeshire Police's roads unit photographed the vehicle outside the station, and later when it was towed away on a recovery truck.
In a tweet, they said: "Even Lamborghinis need insurance."
The driver received a court summons to face an allegation of not being insured to drive the vehicle, and of having no front licence plate.
Cambridgeshire Police said the hire company was summonsed for permitting the vehicle to be driven without insurance.
The owner has been given time to come forward and claim the vehicle, the force said.
"The car is seized and held for 14 days. In that time, if the driver/owner comes forward with the documents required then they can retrieve the car," a spokesman said.
If it is not claimed, the vehicle could end up in a police auction, alongside dozens of stolen or abandoned bicycles usually found in Cambridge.
"Where vehicles are worth more than Â£800 the proceeds of the sale come back to the police," the spokesman said.
"We keep those proceeds for a certain amount of time and if the owner comes forward during this period they can claim the money.
"If they do not, then it is put back into policing," he added.
