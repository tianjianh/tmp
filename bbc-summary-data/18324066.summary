Also on Monday, Breivik told the court he was slighted by Muslims on several occasions during his childhood.
He carried out two deadly attacks in Norway last summer, killing 77 people.
Mr Eielsen has not denied playing a game of cards, a court spokeswoman told the AFP news agency.
Norway attacks: The victims
How the attacks unfolded
"The judges are attentively following what is being said and what is being presented to the court," Irene Ramm told AFP.
"There are different ways of staying focused," she added.
On Monday, Breivik also recalled that when he was seven, his friend's Turkish father wrecked his bicycle, and at the age of 15 he was slapped by a Pakistani underground driver for riding on the outside of an underground car, the Associated Press news agency reports.
Breivik admits the attacks in Oslo and on the island of Utoeya, in which 77 people died and 242 were wounded.
The trial is seeking to establish whether the 33-year-old is sane, in which case he will be sent to prison.
If not, he will be held in a psychiatric institution.
Breivik denies criminal responsibility, arguing his attacks were necessary to combat multiculturalism and prevent a "Muslim invasion" of Norway and Europe.
