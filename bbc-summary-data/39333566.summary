Leicestershire Police officers PC Andrew Munn and PC Bryan Moore were killed when a drunk-driver hit their car during a high-speed chase in 2002.
Both widows received their pensions, but PC Munn's wife Allison Charlton remarried before a change in the scheme in 2015 and lost her payments.
Mrs Charlton said: "I want it to be fair for everybody."
Police and Crime Commissioner Lord Willy Bach says it should be reinstated.
PC Moore's widow Sarah Everitt benefited from the pension as she remarried after the rule change.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Since 1 April 2015, any police widow is treated as if the officer had opted for a "lifetime widow's pension".
Leicestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Lord Willy Bach wants pensions to be reinstated to people whose partners died in the line of duty, regardless of when they remarry.
He said the rule change was unfair on Mrs Charlton, who remarried in 2009.
"The fact that PC Andrew Munn and PC Bryan Moore were both killed as a result of the same crime on the same day simply accentuates this unfairness of this disparity," he said.
Lord Bach is set to raise the issue in the House of Lords later.
Mr Munn left behind his wife and their two children, aged nine and three, while Mr Moore's left his wife and their three children aged 13, 11 and 10.
The Home Office said: "Any pensions already surrendered before 1 April 2015 will not be reinstated."
A spokesman added the government was "committed to ensuring that public service pensions are affordable, sustainable and fair".
