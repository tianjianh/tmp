Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow had to settle for a share of 31st place in the opening event of the LPGA season after a closing two-over-par 75.

Meadow, 24, went into the final round of the Pure Silk Bahamas Classic sharing 13th spot and within striking distance of a top-10 finish.
However, after playing her opening 11 holes in one under par, Meadow then dropped four shots in three holes.
A closing birdie moved the Jordanstown woman up 10 spots in the field.
While she is likely to be disappointed with her closing nine holes as she finished on 11 under par overall, Meadow should take encouragement from the tournament after posting opening rounds of 72, 67 and 67.
Meadow finished a superb third on her professional debut at the US Women's Open in 2014 but suffered a dip in form following the death of her father a year later.
The Northern Irishwoman showed signs of a return to form in the latter part of 2016 as she achieved a top-10 finish at the Canadian Open.
American Brittany Lincicome won with a birdie at the first play-off hole after tying with compatriot Lexi Thompson on 26 under after four rounds.
