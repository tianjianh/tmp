Cardiff City boss Russell Slade is expecting an extra edge to Saturday's Severnside derby at Bristol City.

The Championship match at Ashton Gate will have a sell-out 16,600 crowd, as one stand is closed for development.
"There could well be a nice little edge because three sides of the ground will be absolutely ram packed," Slade said.
Peter Whittingham, Sean Morrison and Craig Noone are all set to return from injuries for the Bluebirds but Fabio De Silva remains out with a groin injury.
"It is a derby game, you have to relish them, embrace them and more importantly try to beat the opposition," added Slade, who is confident his side can cope with the occasion.
"They can be (aggressive matches), but I think it's about control. If you can control your emotions, you can control your performance and that's very important in these games.
"You can't let the occasion catch up with you so you need that concentration and focus in the key moments of the game.
"It's important we stick to our game plan and strategy."
Meanwhile Slade has been given a triple boost with Whittingham, Morrison and Noone all set to return.
"Fingers crossed, I have a selection problem in terms of not just the 11 but the 18, but it'll be a welcome problem," Slade continued.
"It's a nice problem to have one or two players back who have been missing for a good few weeks.
"Fabio (da Silva) is making good progress and all being well Fabio is likely to train on Monday."
