Ince, 25, who scored 38 goals in 115 games for Derby, has signed a three-year contract.
USA international Williams, 28, has agreed a two-year deal.
Chelsea's 20-year-old forward Kasey Palmer, who spent last season on loan with the Terriers, has agreed another season-long loan.
England Under-21 international Palmer has signed a new contract until 2021 with Premier League champions Chelsea.
Huddersfield manager David Wagner said of Ince: "He scores goals, creates them for others and is always a threat when he's on the pitch.
"I have spoken to Tom and he has a massive desire to come to Huddersfield Town and play in the Premier League.
"He has had a taste of the division for two short spells and he is desperate to show everyone that he belongs in the top division. He can be a big player for us."
