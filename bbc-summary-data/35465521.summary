The 49-year-old ex-England striker succeeded Graham Westley in the summer, his first managerial role, with Boro having reached the play-offs last year.
But they are only eight points above the relegation zone, with three points taken from the last 24 available.
"Teddy has had the worst luck I've seen in the 16 years I've owned the football club," said chairman Phil Wallace.
"Normally we'd have one or two major ops on key players in a season but we've had more this season than the last three combined."
Sheringham's side had made two signings on Monday before his departure - converting forward Aaron O'Connor's loan into a permanent move and adding Oxford striker Pat Hoban on a one-month loan.
But Boro, who have suffered long-term injuries to several players including Steven Schumacher, Ben Kennedy and Dave McAllister, are without a win since 12 December.
"You also occasionally lose points in the last few minutes of games but we've been in this situation in four of the last eight matches," said Wallace. "However, we are where we are and the club have to make a change.
"Teddy came in having to work on a lower budget than we've had before and the lack of available funds has made it difficult to get the players he'd like. He's given it his all but it hasn't worked and now we have to thank him for his efforts and move on."
First-team coach Darren Sarll will take caretaker charge of the club.
