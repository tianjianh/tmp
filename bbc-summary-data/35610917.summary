Kenya hunts for escaped Nairobi lions

The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is hunting for at least two lions which have escaped from Nairobi National Park bordering the capital, Nairobi.

Two lionesses escaped not long after midnight and were spotted on main roads in the city by morning.
Nairobi residents have been urged to stay away and report any further sightings to a free telephone line.
"Lions are dangerous wild animals. Don't confront them when you encounter them," KWS's Paul Udoto tweeted.
The KWS spokesman told the BBC that reports in the Kenyan media that six lions were on the loose were exaggerated.
The BBC's Abdinoor Aden in Nairobi says the park is separated by a main road from densely populated neighbourhoods in the south of the city.
Mr Udoto said he was concerned that people would try and tackle the lions themselves, as has happened in the past.
In 2012, four cubs had to be placed in an orphanage after a similar incident led to the killing of their mother.
One of the lionesses currently on the loose has left her cubs in the park, Mr Udoto said.
Answering a question on Twitter from a worried mother, Mr Udoto advised her to keep her children inside until the lions had been safely returned to the park, adding such incidents were the "perils of born town lions".
It is estimated about about 30 lions live in the park.
