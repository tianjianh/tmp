Exova, which is based in Edinburgh, bought Insight NDT Ltd for an undisclosed sum.
Insight has been providing NDT and radiographic inspection services to manufacturers of specialised castings and forgings since 1997.
It also offers testing for the nuclear, medical, rail and oil and gas sectors.
The business has a team of 20 specialists and achieved revenues of about £2m in 2015.
Paul Barry, Exova group managing director for industries, said: "This acquisition significantly enhances our technical expertise and service offering within the NDT market and provides a complementary extension to our specialist testing facilities in the Midlands.
"The addition of Insight to our portfolio is a clear demonstration of our commitment to continuing to diversify our Oil and Gas and Industrials business and to develop our capabilities in new markets."
Exova provides laboratory-based testing, calibration and related services for sectors such as pharmaceuticals, aerospace, engineering and construction.
It runs 138 laboratories and offices in 33 countries and employs more than 4,300 people throughout Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, Asia/Asia Pacific and Africa.
It reported revenue last year of £296.5m.
Exova has made several acquisitions in the past year.
In July it bought Jones Environmental Forensics Ltd, a North Wales-based independent environmental laboratory business.
Prior to that, it acquired a majority stake in Singapore-based Admaterials Technologies Pte Ltd, which provides testing in the construction sector, as well as chemical, environmental and mechanical testing and certification services.
