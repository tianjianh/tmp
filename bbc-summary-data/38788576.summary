Aberdeen store robbed for second time in two weeks

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen convenience store has been robbed for the second time in two weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Friday, a man with a weapon threatened a staff member at Adie's Self Service on Bedford Road, before leaving with a three-figure sum.
It followed an almost identical incident at the shop on 13 January, when a man with a weapon stole money and stock valued at four figures.
Police have yet to confirm whether the robberies are linked.
The suspect in Friday's robbery, which happened at about 18:25, was described as being in his 20s and about 5ft 5in to 5ft 7in tall. He was wearing a black jacket, grey hoody and light blue jeans.
Last week police issued a CCTV image of a man in his 20s they wanted to trace in connection with the robbery on 13 January.
The suspect was wearing a blue top and was last seen on a lane to the rear of Sunnyside Road.
Police have asked anyone who recognises him to come forward.
