[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was found behind a row of bushes in the Ballycolman estate on Wednesday.
It has been taken away by officers for examination.
Det Insp Andy Workman said: "It is reckless in the extreme to leave such an item in an area near to a community centre which is frequented by all members of the community, including children."
He said the "danger" had now been removed and appealed for information.
In a separate incident, police said a number of suspicious objects found during a search of open land at Spout Road in Strabane have been taken away for examination.
Police said there were no further details at this stage.
