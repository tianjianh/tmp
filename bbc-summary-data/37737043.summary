[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 2-3 Bradford City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
James Hanson scored a stoppage-time header against AFC Wimbledon to help Bradford City triumph for the first time in four League One games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordy Hiwula grabbed his fifth goal of the season to give Bradford an early lead, but Tom Elliott levelled for the hosts in the 18th minute.
Wimbledon then took the lead through a 68th-minute Lyle Taylor penalty but Hanson converted a spot-kick of his own before heading a dramatic winner.
Bradford scored in the third minute, Hiwula's shot from the edge of the box deflecting off Paul Robinson into the net.
But AFC Wimbledon were level on 18 minutes as a Hanson header from a free-kick landed at the feet of Elliott, who blasted home.
Wimbledon flew out of the blocks after half-time and deservedly went ahead after Josh Cullen fouled Jake Reeves in the box and Taylor kept his cool from the spot.
But the hosts could not hold on for the win as Matthew Kilgallon was pulled down in the box and Hanson scored the penalty, before he grabbed a late second when meeting Stephen Darby's cross.
