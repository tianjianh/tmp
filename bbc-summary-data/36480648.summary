Peter Howitt, who starred in Bread, said it was a "lovely service. We sang at the top of our voices."
He said Lane had been a joy to work with, and he always relished the arrival of her scripts.
The hearse, containing a wicker coffin topped with white flowers, entered the cathedral to applause from mourners.
Lane was also known for looking after rescued animals - running a sanctuary from her mansion in Horsted Keynes, Sussex, until 2009.
Dogs from the Carla Lane Animals in Need charity were also brought to the cathedral.
Jean Boht, who played Ma Boswell in Bread, said: "Carla Lane had the greatest humanity in her when she wrote about real people."
She joked: "I wanted to sing the Bread song at the service but they wouldn't let me."
Bread, which focused on the working class Boswell family as they struggled through high unemployment in 1980s Liverpool.
Actress Nerys Hughes who starred in The Liver Birds said it was "a very beautiful service".
"I thoroughly enjoyed it and she wrote quite a lot of the material.
"At the end it was like she was talking to us and suddenly I got a jolt that she was gone and it was pretty shattering."
Brookside actor Dean Sullivan, who gave a reading, said: "I met Carla many years ago and we go back a long way. I was thrilled and honoured to be asked to do a reading.
"It was a very fitting tribute and send-off in true Liverpool fashion."
