[SN]TITLE[SN]
Accrington Stanley 3-1 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kayden Jackson scored on his debut as Accrington started the season by beating Colchester.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jackson opened the scoring on nine minutes when he raced onto a through ball from Liam Nolan and finished low into the bottom of the net past Sam Walker.
The Reds doubled their lead on 32 minutes after Colchester failed to clear their lines from a Sean McConville cross and the ball came out to Billy Kee, who rifled home.
Colchester had their chances with Ryan Jackson forcing an early save out of Aaron Chapman, Craig Slater scuffing a shot and Denny Johnstone's close-range strike blocked before half-time.
United boss John McGreal had used all three substitutions by the start of the second half and one of them, Sammie Szmodics, fired narrowly wide just after the restart.
However, it was three on 65 minutes when, from a McConville corner, Nolan headed on and defender Omar Beckles poked home at the far post.
Szmodics got a consolation for Colchester on 82 minutes, rifling the ball home at the far post from a deflected cross.
