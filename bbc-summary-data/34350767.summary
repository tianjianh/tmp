Maidstone's 1975 pub bomb: How IRA was thwarted by soldier

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
When the IRA bombed a Kent pub - a local for the military - 40 years ago, it was only the quick thinking of one soldier that prevented any deaths.

The Hare and Hounds pub in Maidstone - close to the Royal Engineers barracks - was a known target, but then landlord Brian Wooster never thought anything would happen.
However, on 25 September 1975, a bomb was placed outside the pub.
Only by chance did 19-year-old Sapper David Campbell see the device enabling him to raise the alarm.
In the minutes before the explosion, police were called, the pub was cleared, nearby homes were evacuated and roads were sealed off.
Residents then heard "an almighty boom".
Seconds later, Mr Wooster saw glass, wood and debris everywhere, with his destroyed car against the neighbouring prison wall.
He remembers a scene of "absolute devastation".
But, despite a series of false alarms in the months beforehand, Mr Wooster was not unduly alarmed.
"We were scared, of course we were scared. But, being a little pub we only had one door open and we knew all the customers," he said.
"So, if anyone came in we would be on them straight away, especially if they were carrying a bag or anything.
"We felt quite happy that no-one was going to come in here and do anything, but as it turned out they didn't have to."
Because of Mr Campbell's actions, no-one was killed, but two police officers were injured.
One of them, Mick Gray, was going to warn a driver and a pedestrian when the bomb went off.
"I just had this voice in my head say 'run'," he explained.
"I was facing that way and I just ran and I'd only gone a few yards when I was picked up and blown over and all this stuff came at me at the same time."
The uniform he wore that night is covered in holes where shrapnel penetrated his body. A notebook in his top pocket was the only thing that stopped a shard of metal entering his chest.
There were about 20 people in the pub that night.
Mr Campbell said it was pure chance he spotted the device, having gone outside to look for someone who had left their coat in the pub.
Having served in Northern Ireland, his suspicions were immediately raised on seeing a bag next to the landlord's car.
As the area was cleared, police officers shone torches through the gap at the end of the holdall zip and saw batteries, a clock and wires.
The bombers were eventually caught after a tip-off, which led to an armed siege in Balcombe Street, London.
They served more than 20 years in prison before being released under the Good Friday agreement.
The Hare and Hounds still stands on the same site in Maidstone.
