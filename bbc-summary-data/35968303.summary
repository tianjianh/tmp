Services affected include routes to London, Edinburgh, Manchester, North Wales and Southampton.
It was caused by a London Midland train "involved in an incident" with overhead wires at Birmingham International station, Network Rail said.
It said the damage "will not be repaired until 20:00 at the earliest".
About 300 people were queuing at Coventry station following the start of the problems at about 06:30 BST.
By 16:30, London Midland said it was operating a reduced hourly service between Birmingham and Coventry.

Virgin Trains, Arriva Trains, Cross Country and London Midland services routed through Birmingham are either delayed or cancelled.
Liam Sumpter, from Network Rail, said: "Shortly after 06:30 an empty London Midland train leaving Birmingham International station heading towards Coventry, became involved in an incident with the over line equipment."
This "resulted in significant damage to that over line equipment and the train itself, and blocked the line in its entirety," he explained.
He said engineers were on site to rectify the problem.
Commuters took to Twitter to vent their frustrations:
Kirsty from Wolverhampton said: "Seven hours late and the trains still aren't fully sorted. My God its been crazy between Birmingham and Coventry today!"
Fiona Trewavas from Aylesbury said: "Attempting to get to Birmingham to see Mary Poppins. Trains totally messed up. Currently sat at Northampton. Announcements very wrong too!"
Han Nivz from Salford said: "Delays are fine, but we were kept waiting for nearly an hour waiting for a train driver to arrive at Coventry in a taxi...?! "
Bus replacement services have been operating between Rugby, Northampton and Coventry; and Chiltern Railways and Arriva Trains are both accepting London Midland and Virgin tickets.
Birmingham Airport has warned travellers to allow extra time when planning their journey to avoid missing their flight.
