Veterans who transported vital supplies from Britain to Soviet ports have been presented with medals in recognition of their service during World War Two.

The Arctic convoys carried food and military equipment across treacherous seas to support the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1945.
Veterans from Hull and East Riding were honoured by the Russian government at a ceremony in Beverley.
Families of deceased veterans were also presented with medals.
A total of 12 awards were given out, with four surviving veterans accepting theirs personally.
Among them was Frederick Moore, 90, who served on HMS Whirlwind.
Describing it as one of the "proudest days" of his life, he paid tribute to those who took part in the convoys alongside him, describing them as "the bravest men I have ever known".
Freda Crawley collected a medal on behalf of her husband John, who died two years ago. He served on HMS Offa.
She said: "He would have been thrilled, and he was always aware of how Russia felt towards the men of the convoys, and he would have been most appreciative."
She added the crews in no way saw themselves as heroes, but more like "young lads on a great adventure".
Representatives from the Russian Embassy handed out the Medal of Ushakov and said the veterans deserved to be recognised for their part in "a most dangerous and difficult operation".
The medal is named after Fyodor Ushakov, an 18th Century naval commander who never lost a battle and is the patron saint of the Russian navy.
