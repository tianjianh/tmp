The attacker rammed a car carrying explosives into General Mohamed Jimale Goobale's convoy near the defence ministry headquarters in Mogadishu, Somalia's capital.
Al-Shabab claimed the attack and accused the general of plotting against them.
He had survived several previous assassination attempts.

Witnesses in Mogadishu reported hearing a huge explosion.
"The suicide car bomb hit the car they were in. May God rest their souls," police colonel Abdikadir Farah told the Reuters news agency.
A radio station linked to al-Shabab reported a "martyr" had killed the general.
Voting for a new parliament begins on 25 September in Somalia. Lawmakers will then choose a president on 30 October.
Al-Shabab opposes the government of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who is backed by Western powers and seeking re-election.
