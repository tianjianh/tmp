[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Betty Laird died in hospital after the car she was a passenger in was hit on Old Lane in Beeston in September 2014.
Raja Hussain, 31, and Sabir Hussain, 25,  who were convicted of manslaughter, were given sentences of 15 years and 12 years respectively.
Shahrear Islam-Miah, 26, was cleared of manslaughter. All three men were found guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud.
Islam-Miah of Chadderton, Oldham, was sent to prison for four years. The Hussains both live in Beeston.
Mohammed Ubaidullah who was a passenger in the car that hit Mrs Laird's vehicle, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and conspiracy to commit fraud at an earlier hearing.
Ubaidullah, 29, of Ashton-under-Lyne, will be sentenced later.
Trial judge Mr Justice Goss returned the verdicts on Monday with no jury after jurors at Leeds Crown Court reported they were offered bribes.
Mr Justice Goss said there was a "concerted attempt" to tamper with the jury.
