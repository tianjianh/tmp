An investigation into the cause of the fire at Capel Aberfan is continuing.
The internal structure of the chapel, built in 1876, was completely destroyed by the blaze which broke out at 01:51 BST on Saturday.
The chapel was used as a temporary mortuary following the Aberfan disaster in 1966 and housed a memorial organ.
Some neighbouring properties were evacuated as a precaution while firefighters tackled the blaze, but the building has now been made safe.
An assessment is due to be carried out to determine what demolition work will be needed.
South Wales Police are working with the fire service to establish the cause of the fire.
Merthyr Vale councillor Darren Roberts said the building had been "totally gutted".
Although the chapel closed in 2012, occasional services still took place and renovations were ongoing to try and modernise it and bring it back into community use.
