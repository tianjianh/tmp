The one mile (1.6km) race started in Dock 9 near the Lowry and traversed Mariners Canal before ending at Dock 8 by the Helly Hansen Watersports Centre.
Organisers recorded a water temperature of 18.5Â°C (65.3Â°F). Volunteers in safety kayaks monitored the swimmers.
Speaking before the swim, Kai Wright said: "Five months ago I couldn't swim, now I'm attempting this mile.
"When I was invited to join this challenge, I just couldn't but accept. I'm looking forward to conquering my fears."
