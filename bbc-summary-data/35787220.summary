[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers have each been jailed for five years after they viciously attacked a man who asked them to keep the noise down in a tenement close.

John and Jamie McKenzie, from the Haldane area of Balloch in West Dunbartonshire, admitted assaulting Paul Lamb and his girlfriend.
They repeatedly hit Mr Lamb with an iron bar and broken bottle and also hit his girlfriend with the iron bar.
Several of Mr Lamb's teeth were knocked into his lungs during the attack.
He also suffered a broken jaw, cheek and nose.
His girlfriend Laura Melrose suffered a fractured arm as she lay over her boyfriend in a bid to protect him.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that John McKenzie, 25, and Jamie McKenzie, 23, smashed their way into Mr Lamb's flat minutes after he asked them to be quiet.
Mr Lamb had gone to his front door after hearing noise in the close and confronted the brothers, who were visiting their father, before closing his door and going back inside.
After being kicked and punched, Mr Lamb tried to defend himself with an iron weight bar, which he used to do pull ups from the door frame.
But it was grabbed from him and he was repeatedly hit with it, along with a broken bottle.
The court heard that Ms Melrose was repeatedly hit with the bar as she tried to protect Mr Lamb.
The McKenzie brothers were originally charged with attempted murder, but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of assaulting Mr Lamb to his severe injury, permanent disfigurement, permanent impairment and to the danger of his life.
The attack happened in Davidson Road, Jamestown, on 23 August 2014.
The brothers also admitted assaulting Miss Melrose to her severe injury.
Mr Lamb was operated on at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley.
Surgeons removed teeth which had been inhaled into his lungs and stitched wounds to his head, arm and neck. One tooth is still in his lung with doctors monitoring the position. He may also need a further operation on his jaw.
The court was told he now gets breathless even when walking short distances, his mouth is numb and he cannot easily eat solid foods.
Mr Lamb's speech has also been affected, due to the amount of teeth lost and his vision is blurred in his left eye.
He also suffers blackouts, memory loss and headaches and his confidence has been affected.
When questioned by police John McKenzie initially tried to blame his victim claiming he came at them with a baseball bat.
Defence counsel Thomas Ross and Ronnie Renucci said the brothers were remorseful and had no previous convictions for violence.
Judge Lord Matthews said: "The complainer made a remark about noise in the close and you then kicked in his door and assaulted him.
"The complainer has completed a victim impact statement and it makes depressing reading as far as he is concerned."
