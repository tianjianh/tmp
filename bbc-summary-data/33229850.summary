LinksAir Cardiff to Norwich flights scrapped

Flights from Cardiff to Norwich have been shelved just two months after they began.

LinksAir launched the service from the Welsh government-owned Cardiff Airport in April in the hope of attracting business passengers.
But it has now said the route is "not likely to deliver profitability in the very short term" and passengers booked on future flights would be refunded.
Cardiff Airport said it was disappointed by the decision.
LinksAir runs daily Welsh government-subsidised flights from Anglesey to Cardiff and launched the Norwich service in between flights because the plane was sitting dormant for much of the day.
Announcing its cancellation, LinksAir said: "As part of the requirements of operating the Welsh government PSO service to Anglesey twice daily from Cardiff, any additional commercial service must operate autonomous from the PSO service and cover all its operating costs from the outset.
"In the two months since the service commenced, the service was not likely to deliver profitability in the very short term."
It added the move would have no impact on the Cardiff to Anglesey flights.
Debra Barber, managing director at Cardiff Airport, said: "LinksAir's decision to terminate its Cardiff-Norwich service was very disappointing.
"For a new route we feel the load factors were improving in line with expectations and beginning to pick up traction as awareness grew.
"The Anglesey/Ynys MÃ´n service continues to perform very well and remains an important link for business and leisure passengers."
The Welsh Conservatives' Shadow Transport Minister William Graham said it was a "rather unsettling announcement" coming so soon after the route was launched.
"It was only last week that reports confirmed that passenger numbers at Cardiff had dipped below one million, and this news does little to restore shaky confidence in the airport. ," he said.
