[SN]TITLE[SN]
Falkirk 2-2 Raith Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Raith Rovers twice pegged back their hosts to secure a Scottish Championship draw at the Falkirk Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Blair Alston slotted in following Lee Miller's through ball to give the Bairns the lead but James Craigen quickly fired Rovers level.
Falkirk were ahead again through David McCracken's first-half header.
But the visitors equalised again when Mark Stewart struck against his former club, and though Raith had Kyle Benedictus dismissed they held firm.
