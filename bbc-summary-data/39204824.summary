Uwe Hunemeier: Brighton defender feels 'nice to be back' in line-up

Brighton's German defender Uwe Hunemeier says it is good to be back in contention for a place at such a crucial point in the Seagulls' season.

The 31-year-old made his second league start of the season in Tuesday's 2-0 win at Rotherham, after a number of injuries restricted his opportunities.
"You cannot ask for more, coming back after such a long time," he said.
"It is always nice to come back with a win and a clean sheet, when the big time [in the season] is coming up."
The centre-back's only other league outing was away at Brentford in February, following an injury-hit season which has seen him suffer a muscle tear and then a fractured hand.
Hunemeier was selected to play against the Millers as Shane Duffy is out for six weeks with a foot problem.
"There is always a bit of pressure when you have been out for such a long time, I was nervous before the game," he said.
"You never know how you will perform, and I was quite pleased all-in-all."
Second-placed Brighton's win at Rotherham maintained a six-point gap between themselves and Huddersfield in third.
And, having enjoyed promotion to Germany's top flight with Paderborn in 2014, Hunemeier wants a repeat with Brighton this season.
"There is nothing better than to get promotion, and now we are in a really good position," he said. "We came close last year and now we want to do it.
"We have to perform well, and [against Rotherham] we delivered a good performance, a solid performance."
