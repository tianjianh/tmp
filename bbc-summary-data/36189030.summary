Spurs had to beat Chelsea on Monday to keep alive their hopes of securing a first league title since 1961.
But they squandered a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Stamford Bridge, meaning Leicester City were crowned champions for the first time in their history.
"We need to learn but I feel very proud of our players," said Pochettino.
With two games left - at home to Southampton and away to Newcastle - Tottenham are on course to secure their highest finish to a Premier League season.
Pochettino added: "One feeling is to be disappointed because we are not in the race, another is to be realistic. The season so far was fantastic."
In a fiery match, nine Spurs players were booked, the most from one team in a Premier League match.
In the first half, Spurs' Danny Rose and Chelsea's Willian squared up near the touchline, with Pochettino stepping on to the pitch to intervene. In the melee that followed, Mousa Dembele's fingers made contact with Diego Costa's left eye.
Pochettino said he did not see the incident, adding: "When you play a team like Chelsea anything can happen, with the emotion in football, but we need to feel proud. We are the youngest squad in the league."
The Argentine also congratulated Leicester counterpart Claudio Ranieri on a "deserved" title.
Spurs striker Harry Kane, whose 25th league goal of the season gave Tottenham the lead, insisted this was not a "one-off season" for his team.
"When the ex-champions are celebrating like they have won the league it shows we are doing something right," said the England international.
"We have a great manager and great players. We have to keep that and keep moving forward."
