Poppi Worthington death: Date for resumed second inquest announced

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second inquest into the death of Cumbrian toddler Poppi Worthington is to resume before the end of June, a coroner has confirmed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 13-month-old was found with serious injuries at her home in Barrow in December 2012.
A second inquest was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was "unascertained".
Cumbria coroner David Roberts said the fresh hearing would take place between 15 May and 8 June.
Key dates in the Poppi Worthington case
A year ago a family judge ruled Poppi had been sexually assaulted by her father, Paul Worthington, who has always denied any wrongdoing.
No-one has ever been charged in connection with her death, with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) claiming it has no "realistic prospect" of securing a conviction.
The second inquest was suspended in September after the CPS carried out a review of the case, concluding it was right not to bring any charges against Mr Worthington.
