[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Funding for a new train station in Reading has been approved as part of a multimillion-pound spend on improving transport networks across Berkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The £6.4m Green Park station will be built on the Reading to Basingstoke line near the Madejski Stadium, with construction planned in October 2016.
It is part of a £21.4m batch of schemes agreed by the Berkshire Local Transport Body, and funded by the government.
Newbury, Bracknell and Slough councils have had road upgrades approved.
Plans for the station include a bus interchange, park and ride, a short stay car park and taxi drop-off.
Reading Borough's transport chief Tony Page, who also chairs the Berkshire Local Transport Body, said: "It will be instrumental in unlocking the much needed housing and other facilities that are encompassed in the Green Park Village development."
Newbury is to get a direct link between the Hambridge Road industrial area and the A339 - costing £2.34m, and a new £1.9m junction to improve access to London Road Industrial Estate, a regeneration site.
Slough will receive a total of £7.1m to improve the A332 Windsor Road as well as a scheme to improve traffic flow on the A355 between the M4, Slough Trading Estate and the M40.
Bracknell is to build a £3.5m Warfield link road to facilitate plans for a 2,200-home development in the area.
