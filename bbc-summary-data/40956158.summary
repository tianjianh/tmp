Centre-back Venancio, 24, has captained Vitoria for the past three seasons, making 134 appearances in total for the Portuguese Primeira Liga side.
The former Portugal Under-21 international impressed during a pre-season friendly between the two teams.
"I think my game is suited to England - I'm aggressive and I like to play my football at the same time," he said.
