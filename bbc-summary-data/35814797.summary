His manager confirmed a private ceremony was held on Monday.
Sir George signed the Beatles and produced more than 700 records, also working with artists including Gerry and the Pacemakers, Dame Shirley Bassey and Cilla Black.
Sir Paul McCartney led tributes to Sir George, describing him as the "fifth Beatle" and like his "second father".
"I have so many wonderful memories of this great man that will be with me forever," he said in a statement on his website.
"He guided the career of The Beatles with such skill and good humour that he became a true friend to me and my family. If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George."
Adam Sharp, Sir George's manager, said: "I can confirm reports that the family held a small, private funeral for Sir George yesterday, Monday 14 March."
The Sun reported close family and friends attended the ceremony at All Saints Church in Coleshill, Wiltshire, where Sir George lived.
When news of his death emerged last week, Sir George's family thanked everyone "for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support", saying in a statement: "In a career that spanned seven decades, he was an inspiration to many and is recognised globally as one of music's most creative talents. He was a true gentleman to the end."
In his lifetime, he won multiple Grammy awards and an Academy Award nomination for the score to A Hard Day's Night.
Sir George received a knighthood in 1996 and, in 1999, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
