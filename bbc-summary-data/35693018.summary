Juve won the first leg 3-0 and named star duo Paul Pogba and Gianluigi Buffon on the bench.
Marcelo Brozovic gave Inter hope from 20 yards and Ivan Perisic made it 2-0 early in the second half, with Brozovic levelling the tie with a late penalty.
But Rodrigo Palacio was the only player to miss in the shootout as Inter lost.
Milan reached the Stadio Olimpico final on Tuesday after beating third-tier Alessandria 5-0, and 6-0 on aggregate.
