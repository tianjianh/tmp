Fawaz Al Hasawi: Nottingham Forest owner discusses investment with different parties

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nottingham Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi is "discussing investment in the club with different parties", despite saying in July that he hoped a takeover would be completed in a month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Forest are awaiting EFL approval for the purchase of the club by Evangelos Marinakis, owner of Olympiakos.
Marinakis is accused of match-fixing and directing a criminal organisation in Greece but denies the allegations.
"I cannot confirm any definite deal has been done," said Al Hasawi.
Al Hasawi, 47, is understood to want to remain as chairman and retain a 20% share in the two-time European Cup-winning club if any deal with shipping magnate Marinakis or other potential investors goes through.
"I appreciate there has been much speculation about the ownership of the club and about my current level of involvement," Al Hasawi said.
"I have always said I will do what is best for Nottingham Forest and if I decide to make a deal with an investor it will be in the best interests of the club's future."
