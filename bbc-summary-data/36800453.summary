Abeba Aregawi: World 1500m champion can run in Rio despite failing drug test

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former world 1500m champion Abeba Aregawi is hoping to feature at the Olympic Games in Rio after a suspension for failing a drug test was lifted.

The 26-year-old Swede tested positive for meldonium on 12 January this year.
The substance was made illegal by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) on 1 January.
But new guidelines say anyone testing positive who took it before then is free to compete - it is not known how long the drug can stay in the system.
Meldonium - also known as mildronate - is a drug designed to treat ischemia, a condition where there is a reduction in blood supply to body tissue. It is also said to have benefits for diabetes sufferers.
The Swedish Sports Confederation said the suspension was lifted with immediate effect as it had not been proven that she had taken meldonium after it was banned.
The confederation is to meet the country's Olympic Committee to look at Aregawi's possible reinstatement for the Games, which start on 5 August.
Ethiopia-born Aregawi won gold at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow and 2014 World Indoor Championships in Sopot.
