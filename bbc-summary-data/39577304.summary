The 24-year-old has scored 26 goals in 40 league games this season.
Marquis, who won the League Two Player of the Year award on Sunday, joined Rovers on a two-year deal last summer after being released by Millwall.
"I've got a year left on my contract and it would be nice to sit down and sort a new one out," he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"There's no reason why I would want to go anywhere else, my football has come on so much.
"My tactical knowledge of the game has improved, my technique has improved and that is purely down to the manager (Darren Ferguson). He loves coaching and seeing improvements in players individually and as a team.
"He's a brilliant manager and I think we're lucky to have him."
Marquis has now scored as many league goals this season as in his first seven seasons as a professional combined.
Doncaster sealed promotion back to League One with a win over Mansfield on Saturday and he believes the team have everything in place to carry their success into the third tier.
"We've won a lot of games this season and we've done it in different ways and I think if we can take that winning mentality into next season I don't see any reason why we can't be challenging in that top six," he added.
