The 24-year-old, of Kazakhstan, lifted a combined score of 418kg and broke the total world record as well as the clean and jerk world record with 233kg.
Russian Alexandr Ivanov took silver and Anatoli Ciricu of Moldova won bronze.
Briton Peter Kirkbride finished 16th overall after coming seventh in Group B, despite tearing a bicep.
Ilyin repeated his success of 2008 Beijing 2008 to win Kazakhstan's fourth lifting gold of the Games.
Twenty-four-year-old Kirkbride managed an opening snatch of 138kg before suffering the injury trying to lift 142kg at ExCeL.
He then dropped his third and final attempt before lifting a personal best 190kg in the clean and jerk to secure his best total of 328kg.
"It was a great performance, a new PB this year, so I'm happy," Kirkbride said.
"I was just enjoying being in the Olympics. As soon as I got that first clean and jerk in, that was all that mattered to me. Get a total in and be an Olympian."
