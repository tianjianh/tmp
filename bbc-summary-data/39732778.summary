[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alness Academy to shut because of a flea infestation

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A secondary school in the Highlands is to be closed to pupils and staff on Friday to allow contractors to deal with a "mild flea infestation".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The situation at Alness Academy in Alness means swimming lessons at its pool that day have also been cancelled.
Pupils from Bridgend, Coulhill, Ardross, Cromarty, Obsdale, Newmore and South Lodge were due to have lessons.
Highland Council said the pool would be open to the public on Friday evening.
The contractors will spray a treatment on all floors of the school.
