London Fire Brigade (LFB) said more than 20 firefighters tackled the blaze at Eynsford Crescent in Bexley on Friday evening.
The fire destroyed two sheds and damaged two homes.
LFB said a formal investigation into its cause was under way but it was believed to have originated from a dropped cigarette.
A spokesman said: "Firefighters had to work very quickly to stop the fire spreading any further and bring it under control.
"Last year around three fires a day in London were linked to smoking and half of accidental fire deaths were related to careless disposal of cigarettes."
