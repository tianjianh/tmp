The Solar Impulse 2 plane that's powered entirely by the sun, has completed its historic round-the-world journey.

After leaving Cairo on 23 July, it touched back down in Abu Dhabi where it originally started from in March 2015.
The 17-stage journey covered over 42,000km, crossing four continents, three seas and two oceans.
The team set 19 official flight records during the global adventure, which they used to promote renewable energy.
The pilots said it was an amazing adventure, despite sitting in a freezing cold cockpit for as long as five days and five nights at a time, not having enough room to stretch their arms, have a shower, or even go to the toilet properly.
