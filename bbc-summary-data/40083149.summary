More than 120,000 flashes of lightning were recorded over northern France and south-east England in just 12 hours.
Between 18:00 BST on Sunday and 06:00 there were up to 500 flashes a minute.
A house in Staplehurst, Kent, was hit by lightning just after 02:00, which exploded cables and set the roof on fire.
In Folkestone, also Kent, another house was struck causing a power surge and total electrical failure to the home.
People who witnessed the dramatic conditions took to social media to share their thoughts.
Paul Bunyard tweeted: "Fantastic show of force from mother nature last night in Kent."
Emma Carwardine tweeted: "Well they wasn't lying about it being an intense storm for Kent... I mean I have seen worse in America but this is just... crazy."
And Joanna Wyld tweeted:  "This is the most dramatic storm I've ever experienced.  Intensity level just shifted from Jurassic Park to apocalyptic".
