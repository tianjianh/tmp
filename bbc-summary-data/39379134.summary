Alli was dismissed for a challenge on Brecht Dejaegere in the 2-2 draw.
Should Spurs secure a top-three Premier League finish, Alli would miss half of their Champions League group campaign.
Meanwhile, Arsenal have been fined £4,300 after some of their fans ran onto the pitch during the 5-1 Champions League home defeat by Bayern Munich.
Uefa has also fined Bayern Munich £2,600 after their supporters delayed the tie at Arsenal's Emirates stadium by throwing rolls of paper onto the pitch in protest over ticket prices.
Saint-Etienne, meanwhile, have been fined £43,000 after their fans set off fireworks and threw objects during their Europa League encounter against Manchester United at Old Trafford last month.
Spurs, who went out of the Europa League against Gent, are second in the Premier League with 10 games to play.
Alli also missed the final three games of last season's Premier League after admitting a charge of violent conduct for punching West Brom's Claudio Yacob in the stomach.
