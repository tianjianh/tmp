The Australian singer, 48, popped in to Dee Valley Confectioners in Ballater on Friday while visiting the area.
She chatted, bought two bags of sweets, and posed for a picture.
Staff member Wendy Anderson told the BBC Scotland news website: "You look at someone and think is that them. I said 'I am not being rude but are you who I think you are?' And she said 'yes'."
Mrs Anderson, also 48, added: "I was a fan when I was younger, she was my era."
Kylie has had a string of hits over many decades, including I Should Be So Lucky, Spinning Around and Can't Get You Out Of My Head.
