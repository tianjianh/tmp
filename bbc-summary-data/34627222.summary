Ryan Pringle: Durham all-rounder signs new contract

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham have extended the contract of all-rounder Ryan Pringle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old off-break bowler and right-handed batsman ended the season in fine style, scoring a career-high 99 against Hampshire.
He also took three wickets in each of his final three innings as Durham ended the season in fourth place in the County Championship Division One.
Pringle follows former England all-rounder Paul Collingwood in signing a new deal at Chester-le-Street.
It comes days after Derbyshire took the unusual step of issuing a press release denying their interest and signing of the player for 2016.
