George Groves thinks the loser of his super-middleweight fight with Martin Murray on Saturday will quit boxing.

Groves, 28, has lost three world title bouts, while Murray, 33, has been unsuccessful in four world title bouts, drawing one and losing three.
"I am treating this like the last-chance saloon. If I can't beat Martin then I don't deserve to become a world champion," said Londoner Groves.
"There are a lot of world champions out there and I want to be one of them."
Groves' bout with Murray at London's O2 Arena is the chief support on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's first defence of his IBF heavyweight world title against American Dominic Breazeale.
Groves' first world title attempt saw him floor reigning champion Carl Froch in the first round in November 2013, before referee Howard Foster controversially stopped the contest in the ninth, declaring Froch the winner.
The rematch, held in May 2014 in front of 80,000 people at Wembley Stadium, saw Groves knocked out in the eighth round.

His third failed attempt to win a world title came in September, when he suffered a split decision points defeat against Sweden's Badou Jack in Las Vegas.
"The longer it goes on the more you want it," added Groves. "When you are a kid you dream of becoming a world champion and I have an awful lot left to achieve."
St Helens-based Murray drew his middleweight title world bout against Felix Sturm in February 2011, before losing to Sergio Martinez in April 2013 and Gennady Golovkin in February 2015.
He then moved up a weight but failed in his fourth attempt to win a world title, losing on a split decision to WBO super-middleweight champion Arthur Abraham last November.
"I think the loser packs it in," said Groves. "Martin's older than me and he's exhausted all the natural things a fighter can do.
"He didn't pull it off at middleweight, he's moved up to super-middleweight and he's had a crack at Arthur Abraham, who on paper he should be beating.
"I thought Martin could beat Arthur, but he let himself down there."
Meanwhile, Martin said any fame Groves had achieved was down to his two defeats by Froch and that he had mixed in more exalted company.
"I've been in bigger fights than him all over the world against better opposition, he got his name by losing twice to Carl Froch," said Murray.
"After Badou Jack I heard he was talking about retiring. He's come back and had two fights where he's been firing at sitting ducks, so he's got his confidence back now.
"Now he thinks that this is an easy fight. But it's not, when it gets tough he will crumble."
Chris Eubank Jr has vowed to display "no mercy" against Tom Doran on Saturday.
Eubank Jr will be defending his British middleweight title for the first time and says he will not be affected by his most recent outing against Nick Blackwell, who retired from boxing after he suffered bleeding on his skull and later put in an induced coma after losing to Eubank in March.
"I'm not going to let a situation like what happened in my last fight affect my future performances," said Eubank Jr.
Eubank Jr, 26, has set his sights on a fight later this year with Kazakhstan's Golovkin, the WBA, IBF, WBC and IBO middleweight world champion.
However, Welshman Doran, unbeaten in 17 fights, accused his opponent of not showing him enough respect and said: "I think all the Golovkin talk is disrespectful but I've pushed it to one side.
"It doesn't get better than this, I can't wait to take the chance with both hands."
Eubank Jr responded by saying: "Every fighter has their goals and dreams. I want to fight the best and beat the best. I'm gunning for the main guy and I have to put on serious performances."
British heavyweight Dillian Whyte is fighting for the first time on Saturday since his lost his unbeaten record in December with a seventh-round stoppage defeat against Joshua.
Nevertheless, Whyte, 28, is confident he can get to the top of the division and has targeted fellow Briton Dereck Chisora, a former world title challenger, as his next opponent.
"I really want to fight Chisora in December. I want to get him in the ring and put a stop to his career," said Whyte, who needed a shoulder operation after his loss to Joshua.
Whyte's next opponent is 34-year-old Ivica Bacurin from Croatia, a fighter who has won 25, lost nine and drawn one of his 35 professional contests.
"I'm fit and ready. The hardest part with any injury is the mental aspect. The plan is to knock this fella out on Saturday," added Whyte.
Conor Benn, the son of former middleweight and super-middleweight world champion Nigel Benn, fights for the third time as a professional. He has won his first two light-welterweight fights and takes on Lukas Radic of the Czech Republic.
Anthony Ogogo, a bronze medallist at the London 2012 Olympics, has won all nine of his contests in an injury-hit professional career and fights Croatian middleweight Frane Radnic.
