The British women's team topped the Olympic qualification classification, while the men's team finished fifth.
Zoe Smith is the leading women's candidate, but Rebakah Tiler could come into contention.
However, Jack Oliver, the previous favourite to take the men's spot, missed the competition through injury.
"Two Olympic qualification spots is a tremendous achievement," said British Weight Lifting performance director Tommy Yule.
The British Championships in June are the final opportunity for athletes to prove their credentials before nominations are made to the British Olympic Associate for Team GB selection.
