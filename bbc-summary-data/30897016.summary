Deirdre Barlow's best Coronation Street moments

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
She first appeared in Coronation Street in 1972 as "a young 17-year-old 'dolly bird'".

Add more than 40 years, four weddings, one daughter and too many pairs of glasses to count and Deirdre Barlow has become an icon of the ITV1 soap.
Anne Kirkbride who played the husky-voiced red wine lover appeared in more than 3,000 episodes.
She died at the age of 60 after a short-term illness, but what will we remember Deirdre for?
In the early days her huge spectacles didn't even have lenses and she wore some interesting frames.
Later she opted for a smaller style.
She loves her chain belts.
In fact it's rare you'd see Deirdre without one.
No it's not "chicken pie, shop bought".
It is of course her stuffed marrow, which she stuffs with mince and couscous.
In 1998 she spent time in jail for fraud.
The storyline even spilled over into real life when then Prime Minister Tony Blair demanded the release of #theWeatherfieldone (and that was way before Twitter or trending was even thought of!).
She's been married four times and been in more than 10 different relationships during her four decades on the street.
She was married twice to Ken.
The first time in 1981 more than 24 million viewers watched the wedding (which generated higher ratings for ITV than the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer).
A year later and Deirdre's having an affair with ex-boyfriend Mike Baldwin.
The storyline proves to be a ratings winner and it's the first Corrie story to be written about in the newspapers.
When Deirdre went back to Ken after the affair with his rival, it was flashed up on screens at Manchester United's Old Trafford with the words 'Ken and Deirdre reunited. Ken 1 - Mike 0'... the crowd cheered.
"Ken do something," is often trotted out when she's in a fix. Our favourite time is when Gail throws a pie in Deirdre's face after she insults her.
And then of course there's "Oh Tracy luv" Deirdre's used this countless times in reference to her daughter who tends to rub most other street residents up the wrong way.
