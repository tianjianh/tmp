WWF's call to ease impact of 'busier Celtic seas'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The seas surrounding much of Wales risk becoming "more and more degraded" over the next 20 years unless work is done to limit the impact of shipping and energy generation, a report has found.

Conservation charity WWF said the seas are set to get much busier and it is also worried about a "substantial impact" on marine environment.
It has concerns for fish stocks, seabed damage, pollution and marine litter.
It wants help by conservationists and industries working together.
The "Future Trends in the Celtic Seas" report calls for "a more joined-up approach to managing our seas".
The "Celtic Seas" are home to a wide range of species, including whales, dolphins and cold-water corals.
Dr Jenny Oates, manager of the "Celtic Seas" partnership project for WWF-UK, told BBC Wales without better management of industrial activity in the coming years "we run the risk of the seas becoming more and more degraded".
She added: "That would minimise what we as humans can get out of the marine environment."
The call comes only days after the go-ahead was given for controversial plans to restart scallop fishing in a protected area in Cardigan Bay.
The charity calculated the seas are worth Â£15bn a year to the economies of the UK, Ireland and France, supporting an estimated 400,000 jobs.
Wales' territorial waters are the same size as the country itself - a "huge asset to the Welsh economy".
The study considered three potential scenarios for the next 20 years, including one where the environment takes centre stage and another with more local decision-making.
Its findings suggested the seas will have three "hot-spots" of particularly intense activity.
In the Severn estuary and along the coast of south Wales, the Irish Sea and north Wales coast and the west coast of Scotland, a number of sectors are set to be fighting for space.
Call to ease impact of 'busier' seas
Increasingly, large renewable energy schemes, such as the tidal lagoons planned for the south Wales coast, fisheries and shipping companies want to operate in the same waters.
The report predicts that could lead to tensions as well as the need for compensation measures for wildlife when it comes to large developments.
Increased noise will make the sea less hospitable for marine mammals like dolphins and porpoises. This could be eased, the report says, if developments are sited away from key breeding grounds or taking action to reduce noise at source.
But the research highlights opportunities too - with the potential development of offshore wind farms across the region, for example, boosting the ports sector in future to the tune of Â£240m a year.
Dr Oates said: "The Celtic Seas are a major asset but we also realised that these are leading to more pressures on the marine environment and these need to be taken account of in future decision-making.
"It's really important to have a joined-up approach, we want to make sure governments, sea users and different industries are sharing information and working together to maximise the benefits, while making sure we protect the marine environment and wildlife within it.
"It's also important to work together with neighbouring countries - marine wildlife doesn't recognise national boundaries and we need to manage our seas in a way that reflects this."
The Welsh Government is currently developing the first national marine plan for Wales, which it said would set out its policy and priorities for the sustainable use of the seas.
Also this week, it is leading a trade mission to Brussels to promote Wales as a key international location for marine energy devices and technologies.
A spokesperson said it would "study the report's findings in detail".
A Defra spokesperson said: "As an island nation our coastal communities and marine environment are not just crucial to our economy, but are also part of our national identity.
"That is why we work closely with devolved administrations, industry and charities to carefully manage and protect our marine environment, whether through ensuring sustainable fishing stocks or introducing a blue belt of marine conservation zones around our coastline."
