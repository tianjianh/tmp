Former Fulham midfielder Danny Murphy says he would consider becoming the new manager at Craven Cottage.

Felix Magath was sacked with the club bottom of the Championship after seven games, following their relegation from the Premier League last season.
Murphy spent five seasons at Fulham making more than 200 appearances.
"I care about the club deeply and I've always had a desire to get involved but that's out of my hands," the 37-year-old told BBC Radio 5 live Sport.
"I've always said I'd like to go back to Fulham at some point in some capacity because I have an affinity with the supporters there.
"If they did want to speak to me, of course I'd be open-minded to that. I would never disregard something like that."
Magath, 61, had only been in charge of the club since February but his side had taken just one point from their first seven games of the new campaign. The club's under-21 manager Kit Symons has been named as caretaker boss.
Murphy expects the Cottagers to name an experienced replacement but says the most important thing is that they avoid relegation.
"First and foremost, it's about finding the candidates that can get Fulham out of this mess and if people within the hierarchy of the club think that's someone with more experience than me, that's fine," he said.
"My desire is to see them not at the bottom of the Championship because one thing is for sure, if their form continues and there was another relegation, the club structure and finances would be a catastrophe."
Magath became Fulham's third manager of the 2013-14 season following the dismissals of Martin Jol and Rene Meulensteen, but the German could not save the west London club from relegation, ending their 13-year stay in the top flight.
"There were certain methods that he adopted or tried to instil into the players that many of them felt were very unusual to say the least, if not prehistoric," added Murphy.
"It didn't look like a team dying for the cause and playing for the manager, it certainly looked like a lot of players, who were confused and unsure of what they were trying to do."
