[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hawick has kicked off the common riding season in the Borders on the 500th anniversary of a historical battle which is central to its celebrations.

The festivities were given extra significance due to the landmark date.
The Battle of Hornshole in 1514 saw a group of Hawick youths defeat an English raiding party and capture their standard.
It is a key part of the annual common riding tradition and statues in the town also commemorate the event.
Earlier this year, about 1,800 children dressed up in period costume to recreate the conflict.
The re-enactment also included a fight sequence involving 22 boys from Hawick High School, representatives of the common riding, battle re-enactors and a stunt team.
This year the common ridings are also playing a key part in Homecoming Scotland 2014.
The towns of Hawick, West Linton, Selkirk, Peebles, Melrose, Galashiels, Jedburgh, Duns, Kelso, Lauder and Coldstream are taking part in the Return to the Ridings scheme.
They are working with Homecoming Scotland and Scottish Borders Council (SBC) to increase their marketing and promotion.
The common ridings and festivals recreate the ancient tradition of riding a town's boundaries on horseback.
