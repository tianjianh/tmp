[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guiseley 1-1 Eastleigh

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jake Lawlor grabbed Guiseley a glorious equaliser six minutes into stoppage time to salvage a draw against Eastleigh at Nethermoor Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old midfielder bundled the ball in at the third attempt after a dramatic goalmouth scramble, sending the home support delirious.
The Lions had emerged from the tunnel rueing not taking a first-half lead as Will Hatfield had a goal-bound shot clawed away by Graham Stack. Instead, James Constable capitalised at the other end and rifled in a shot to put the away side in front.
Substitute Sam Muggleton missed a gilt-edged chance for Eastleigh in the second half, blazing wide from close range following an accurate cross by Sam Matthews, and it proved costly.
