Tesco has stopped the sale of 5p plastic carrier bags in a trial at three of its stores.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
For the next 10 weeks, shoppers who do not bring their own bags to the shops in Aberdeen, Dundee and Norwich will have to buy a "bag for life" costing either 8p or 10p.
It is part of a trial to further cut the number of bags in circulation.
If successful, the withdrawal of 5p bags could be rolled out by Tesco in its stores across the UK.
A Tesco spokesman said: "We are carrying out a short trial in a few stores to look at the impact on bag usage if we remove single-use carrier bags.
"In these stores customers who need a bag can still buy a bag for life which they can reuse."
Online customers will still be able to buy 5p bags, but Tesco said 57% per cent of them already opt for bag-less deliveries.
