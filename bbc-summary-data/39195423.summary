[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sam Williams' last-gasp conversion foiled a Salford fight-back and earned Wakefield back-to-back Super League wins in a thriller at Belle Vue.

Reece Lyne and Jacob Miller tries had Wakefield 12-2 up at the break, but Ben Murdoch-Masila, Kris Welham and Greg Johnson scores turned the game around.
George Griffin's try looked to have secured the points but Bill Tupou crossed to keep Trinity in the game.
Lyne squeezed in to level, and Williams stayed cool to kick the winning points.
Wakefield ended a run of 12 games without a win against St Helens last time out and showed the character to revive this game when it looked as though Salford had finished them off.
Lyne celebrated his new two-year contract with his finishes, both well taken out wide, but a late injury to him could rule him out for some time while the guile of Williams was matched by his kicking and that proved crucial.
The visitors, who beat Warrington impressively last week, could have retaken the lead and settled the game with the last play but Murdoch-Masila was unable to retain his grasp on the ball over the line.
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester: "I thought we'd won it and thrown it away. It's a great win for us but we got out of jail. It shows the character and belief that we can come back and get a result when we looked like we weren't going to get anything from the game.
"I'm happy for the fans because it's the first time we've won at home since we beat Warrington here last May. I'm pleased we've been able to send those people home happy.
"We don't know exactly what Reece Lyne has done but it looks like a nasty knee injury. It's disappointing for Reece but it gives an opportunity to Joe Arundel next week."
Salford head coach Ian Watson on Mudoch-Masila's spill in the last moments: "At full speed it looks like he has dropped it but a Sky camera might tell you different because you've seen them given before.
"It's probably a case for having Sky cameras at every game but there's obviously a cost to the RFL. To be fair we should have drawn the winger and passed to Kris Welham who would have probably scored in the corner.
"It's a tough loss for us but it's a lesson we've got to learn. You can't question the players' desire, it was a bit of smartness that let us down, especially in the first half."
