Thornhill and her sighted pilot Hall added the kilometre time trial title to the pursuit crown they won on Thursday.
They led a British clean sweep ahead of Aileen McGlynn and Louise Haston with Alison Patrick and Helen Scott third.
Jon Gildea and men's tandem pair James Ball and Matt Rotherham claimed their first World titles.
It takes GB's gold medal tally to five with more medal chances to come in Sunday's final session.
Thornhill and Hall finished in a time of one minute 9.552 seconds to beat 43-year-old McGlynn, who is in her first GB outing since 2012, and Haston by 1.537 seconds.
Paralympic triathlon silver medallist Patrick, who is making her debut in international track cycling, and Scott were a further 0.026 seconds back.
"To stand up there with our team-mates was brilliant. I've never experienced that before," Thornhill told BBC Sport.

Hall added: "More GB riders coming through is good; it pushes us along and keeps the competition high."
Ball and Rotherham were the penultimate pair to ride in the men's event and after clocking 1:00.727 seconds. They watched on as Commonwealth Games champions Neil Fachie and Craig Maclean failed to better their time [1:02.39).
"It's one of the greatest feelings I've ever had," said Welshman Ball, who finished fifth with Maclean at the Rio Paralympics
"I'm really happy with how it turned out and I'm hoping for good things on Sunday in the sprint."
Gildea's success in the C5 4km pursuit comes off the back of missing out on selection for Rio 2016.
After qualifying second behind Lauro Cesar Chaman of Brazil, the 38-year-old from Sale, who became eligible for Para-sport in 2013 after breaking his leg badly in a mountain bike accident, dug deep in the final to beat his rival by 1.985 seconds.
"It's nice to come back and get a world champion's jersey. That's the starting point for getting on my way to Tokyo," he said.
