A gunman shot and injured six people inside a parcel sorting plant in suburban Atlanta before killing himself, police have said.

The shooting at a FedEx centre in Kennesaw, Georgia, was reported at about 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT).
Officers found the suspect dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot.
Two victims had "life threatening" injuries and were in surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
The identity of the suspected gunman was not immediately released.
A witness told the Associated Press news agency the gunman had an assault-style rifle, knife and bullets strapped across his chest "like Rambo".
David Titus, a FedEx lorry driver, said he was just arriving at work when he saw someone shoot a security guard in the abdomen outside the building, then he heard more shots inside.
"It was chaos," Mr Titus said. "Everyone was running ducking and hiding, trying to get out of there."
Dr Michael Nitzken of Wellstar Kennestone Hospital told reporters two people hit by gunfire were in surgery in critical condition. One additional victim was in critical condition, one was in stable condition and two were treated and expected to be released from hospital.
All had multiple gunshot wounds.
FedEx said the company was co-operating with police but had no details to release about the shootings.
"Our primary concern is the safety and wellbeing of our team members, first responders and others affected," said spokesman Scott Fiedler.
Last week, Georgia's governor signed into law a sweeping new gun bill that allows people to carry guns into bars, airports, some government buildings and places of worship.
