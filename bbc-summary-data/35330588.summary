Jamie Ward's goal sealed victory for Nottingham Forest against pre-match leaders Middlesbrough, and extended their unbeaten run to 12 games.

Ward took Ben Osborn's pass and slotted past Dimi Konstantopoulos to give them the lead against the run of play.
The home side had long spells of possession, but missed key chances as Emilio Nsue headed over from close in, while Grant Leadbitter hit the bar.
Hull's win at Fulham moved them above the Teessiders, who dropped to second.

Forest, who also saw Osborn's shot strike a post, started with a game-plan to stifle the home side and executed it to perfection to secure a first win on Teesside since February 1993.
Boro's impressive home defensive record, without a goal conceded in 851 minutes at the Riverside before kick-off, was in little danger during a first half lacking in action.
Jack Hobbs' mis-kick was the nearest the visitors came to a goal, as Boro enjoyed the best of the play, with David Nugent, Tomas Kalas and Cristhian Stuani all unable to connect with teasing deliveries into the box.
Dougie Freedman's side continued to frustrate Boro after the break, with occasional forays from Oliver Burke causing the home side some concern on the break.
Both sides struck the woodwork and then Nsue's miss from three yards out ramped up the anxiety around the Riverside, before Ward's finish eventually broke the deadlock.
Aitor Karanka's side tried to lift a sizeable home crowd, with roars for a penalty when Fernando Amorebieta went down under Gary Gardner's challenge, but they were unable to avoid a first league defeat since August.
Middlesbrough head coach Aitor Karanka:

"Losing at home is disappointing, but it's not just the game today it's the last three games now. They have been really poor.
"We've lost two games but we're still in the top two and I'm really optimistic.
"I know the reason for the problem but I prefer to fix it on the training ground.  The problem is when you're in a bad run and don't know why - but I know the reason.
"With these players we're at the top of the table. We've got two weeks to work and I want to transmit a positive message. It's not by chance we're near the top of the table."
Nottingham Forest boss Dougie Freedman:
"It's a big result for us. The last time Forest won here Mr Clough was in charge, so it's been a long time.
"That was our toughest match of the season because they grind you down and never stop going.
"We stopped Middlesbrough in the right areas. They were not getting shots from the edge of the box or playing one-twos in front of the area.
"Give us credit for not letting them get time and space. We believed from the first 10 or 15 minutes that we could win this."
