Glasgow bin lorry family begins prosecution

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The family of three victims of the Glasgow bin lorry accident have taken the first formal step towards bringing a private prosecution against the driver, Harry Clarke.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawyers representing the Sweeney and McQuaid family have delivered a Bill of Criminal letters to the Lord Advocate.
This begins the process of asking the High Court to allow them to bring a private prosecution.
The Lord Advocate has seven days to respond.
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: "Scottish Ministers have received further information in support of an application for public funding towards a private prosecution from lawyers acting on behalf of the families of the Glasgow Bin Lorry tragedy, and will now consider this closely."

Before a private prosecution can proceed, the Lord Advocate, Scotland's senior prosecutor must "grant concurrence", signifying he is happy for it to go ahead.
If he does not, it remains up to the High Court to decide whether the application can proceed.
But judges there will look at whether there is a "sufficiency of evidence" to bring about a private case - in other words, whether the case has a good chance of succeeding.
They must also establish if there are exceptional circumstances to allow a private prosecution, bearing in mind the Crown has decided not to bring charges against Harry Clarke, the bin lorry driver.
In a lengthy interview with BBC Scotland in August, 2015, the Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland QC set out in detail why Mr. Clarke wasn't to be prosecuted.
He said there was insufficient evidence in law to bring charges, and said then he believed a private prosecution would not succeed.
The key point was that Mr Clarke was unconscious at the time of the accident, so he was not controlling the vehicle, and therefore did not have the criminal intent required to bring charges.
Also, since he had not had a blackout for four years, he could not have predicted he would have one on the fatal day.
