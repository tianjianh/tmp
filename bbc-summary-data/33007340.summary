[SN]TITLE[SN]
Clacton Pier helter-skelter tower 'fully repaired' after storm

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A helter-skelter which collapsed on a pier during a storm nearly two years ago has finally been "fully repaired".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Clacton Pier attraction "buckled in the middle" when the coast was hit by 80mph (129km/h) winds in October 2013.
The pier's admin manager Sharon Charters said the process had been slow because they wanted to make sure the ride was "restored to its former glory in the correct and proper way".
It is likely to be back up and running at the Essex attraction in September.
