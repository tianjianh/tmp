[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tej Bahadur Yadav's videos were viewed over eight million times and had generated outrage among Indians.
He alleged that the quality of the food was so poor that many times soldiers opted to go without instead.
Mr Yadav has said he will appeal against the decision in a higher court.
Mr Yadav, who belonged to the Border Security Force (BSF), posted videos in January of burnt roti (flatbread) and lentils that he said had only turmeric and salt.

A BSF statement quoted by The Hindu newspaper said Mr Yadav had been dismissed for "making false allegations, posting photographs on social media and for carrying two mobile phones".
It said he carried two mobile phones while on operational duty against the standard operating procedures and also posted photographs in uniform on social media in contravention of instructions.
"The individual [Mr. Yadav] was found guilty of all the charges and awarded dismissal from service," the statement said.
The BSF had said earlier that the soldier had several complaints against him and had faced disciplinary action in 2010.
