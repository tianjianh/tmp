The trio will all compete in the individual and men's team foil events.
The three also competed in the 2012 London Games, where GB finished sixth in the team event, and Kruse, 32, will be going to his fourth Games.
Kruse said: "It's the pinnacle of the sport so to be able to go out for my fourth Games is going to be brilliant."
Kruse, and Olympic squad reserve Marcus Mepstead, were part of the GB team which beat Italy to win the team foil gold at the European Games in 2015.
The GB team then secured its place in Brazil in February with a ninth-placed finish at the World Cup in Bonn.
Alex Newton, Team GB Fencing team leader, said: "The experience they all have is really important.  It's a huge opportunity now.
"They are there by right and given the field and where they are within that, there is a real medal chance."
Fencing has been incorporated in every Games since 1896.
Great Britain have won nine medals, but none since Tokyo in 1964, a run Davis, 24, believes could be ended in Rio.
"I think it's realistic we could medal in both individual and team events," Davis told BBC Sport.
"We've beaten every single top team over the last two years and it's just who copes with the pressure on the day."
