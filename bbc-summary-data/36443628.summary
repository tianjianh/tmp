Prof Julian Andrews said: "The site was discovered by snorkelers and first thought to be an ancient city port, lost to the sea.
"There were what superficially looked like circular column bases, and paved floors.
"But mysteriously no other signs of life - such as pottery."
Found close to Alikanas Bay the site was examined in situ by the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities of Greece.
"We investigated the site," said Prof Andrews, "and found that it is actually a natural geologically occurring phenomenon."
