The man barged in after the victim, who is in her 60s, opened the door of her house in East Didsbury, on 20 May. She reported the attack on Wednesday.
Greater Manchester Police said it was thought that the man regularly visits the area.
He was described as black, in his 40s, and about 5ft 10ins (1.8m) tall with a broad build and short black hair.
He had "dark pigmentation near his side burns and a distorted knuckle on the fourth finger of his right hand, which pushes the knuckle towards his little finger", police said.
Police have appealed for anyone with any information to come contact them.
