Wales 'suffers double whammy of Labour and weak devolution'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales is suffering from a "double whammy" of a Labour government and weak devolution, Leanne Wood will tell the SNP conference in Aberdeen.

The Plaid Cymru leader will say she is determined to lead her party into government at the assembly elections.
Ms Wood will attack Labour's record, accusing First Minister Carwyn Jones's government of failing.
She will say Scotland has a nationalist government with a track record of making the most of its powers.
"In Wales we have a double whammy: a nation without basic powers and a government that wouldn't have a clue what to do with them," Ms Wood will tell the conference.
Plaid and the SNP are long-standing allies.
But while the SNP has overtaken Labour as Scotland's biggest party, Plaid goes into next May's devolved elections as the assembly's third party - behind Labour and the Conservatives.
Ms Wood will say: "Indeed it is my determined resolution to lead Plaid Cymru into government next May because that represents the change Wales needs - the future our people deserve.
"It is my hope therefore to return to your conference next year and congratulate you on yet another famous election success and to do so as the newly-elected first minister of Wales."
