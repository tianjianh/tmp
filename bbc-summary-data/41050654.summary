The exhibition opens at the Gloucester Life Museum on 26 August and runs until 16 December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Diana super-fan who has amassed memorabilia dedicated to the late Princess of Wales has lent some of her collection to a special exhibition.
Jo Dobson has hundreds of plates, portraits and trinkets which are in a show at Gloucester Life Museum about local people who collect for a hobby.
Mrs Dobson, 78, started her collection, with her late husband Ken, in 1999 and said "there'll never be another Diana".
She has also written to her MP calling for a Diana Day each year.
Mrs Dobson, of Hucclecote, Gloucester, said she had now stopped collecting.
She said: "We had to stop. There comes a time when you've run out of room on the wall. We've spent thousands but she was worth it."
Gloucester Life Museum curator Sarah Orton said: "The exhibition is less about the collection and more about the collectors.
"Without such people in the past many museums including our own would not have been established."
