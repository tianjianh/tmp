The aftermath of the London terror attacks again dominates most of Scotland's front pages, with many carrying images of a Trafalgar Square vigil.

The National says thousands united in solidarity at the vigil after Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to the victims during an emotional First Minister's Questions at Holyrood.
Faith leaders, tourists, commuters and emergency service workers were among those who joined the "dignified tribute" at the London landmark, according to The Herald.
The i newspaper also features an image from Trafalgar Square, while its lead story focuses on Khalid Masood, the man responsible for the attack which killed four people and injured many more.
Masood was inspired by Islamic State ideology and had been previously investigated by MI5, according to The Scotsman.
Meanwhile, the Daily Record describes the attacker as a "weak-minded savage exploited by the monsters of Isis". It adds: "He killed a hero PC, a devoted mum, a loving husband and an OAP."
The Scottish Sun reports that Masood told workers at a budget hotel in Brighton: "I'm off to London today". The paper claims he said the capital "isn't like it used to be".
And the Scottish Daily Mail claims guides to mounting a "car terror attack" are available on Google and Twitter.
Elsewhere,  The Courier reports that nurses at Perth Royal Infirmary have contacted the paper to blow the whistle on staff shortages at the hospital. They claim it is only a matter of time before the shortages result in a death, but health bosses have moved to reassure patients.
The Press and Journal leads with a story about a pub in Keith, Moray, which was sealed off after it received a suspicious package with a note referring to so-called Islamic State.
