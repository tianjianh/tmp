Huston, who represents Great Britain in the men's individual event, had to battle through qualifying and five rounds to reach the last four.
He lost in the semi-finals, but with three Rio places up for grabs Huston held his nerve in the 3rd/4th play-off.
He scored a maximum '10' with his final arrow to beat Serbia's Luka Popovic.
Huston, 20, was defeated at the semi-final stage by eventual winner Mete Gazoz of Turkey.
"Having heard the crowd this close to you, that many people all cheering for Great Britain, clapping, hearing them shouting my name, was such an amazing feeling," he said.
"Yes, I was nervous and the shots weren't as good as I would have liked.
"But I won the match, won the place, and that's all that matters."
All six British archers were in contention for Rio invitations at the start of the day of competition, when the continental quota tournament resumed in the third round.
Larry Godfrey and Kieran Slater won their opening matches, but were both stopped short in the last 16.
Recurve women's trio Naomi Folkard, Amy Oliver and Bryony Pitman failed to make it past the third round.
Great Britain still has a chance to qualify for a women's place, or upgrade to full team invitations in either competition, at the last stage of the 2016 World Cup in Turkey next month.
