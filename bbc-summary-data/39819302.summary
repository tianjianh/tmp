Police and fire crews were called to the Wycombe Air Park in Clay Lane, Booker, just after 09:40 BST.
South Central Ambulance Service said the aircraft, which had three men on board, ended up on its side.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch is sending a team to the scene of the crash to investigate.
An ambulance service spokesman said one man was taken to John Radcliffe Hospital with life-threatening injuries.
A second man suffered serious leg, chest, abdominal, head and shoulder injuries and a third patient had less serious back injuries.
Three ambulances, two rapid response vehicles and the Thames Valley Air Ambulance were called to the scene.
Andy Nunnen, ground services manager at the airfield, was one of the first people on the scene and helped the men out of the helicopter.
"We saw smoke coming out of the engine gearbox area," he said.
"We immediately deployed the lines and laid a foam blanket down and cooled the engine down.
"Thankfully all souls were saved.
"It's not a normal day's work for us, this sort of incident is thankfully very rare."
