A black Ford Fiesta and a black Renault Kadjar were involved in the collision on the B4278 between Penrhiwfer and Tonyrefail at 11:35 BST.
Stephen Woodland, who was driving the Fiesta died, while a 43-year-old driver of the other car and her daughter, three, were taken to hospital.
Mr Woodland's family said they were "heartbroken".
In a statement, they described how they were "coming to terms with the tragic loss" of the father-of-two, and added their "thoughts are also with the other family involved".
Police said the injuries sustained by the mother and daughter are not thought to be serious and appealed for witnesses.
