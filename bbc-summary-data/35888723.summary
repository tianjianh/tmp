Islamic State conflict: Syrian forces 'enter Palmyra'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Syrian government forces have entered the ancient town of Palmyra seized by Islamic State (IS) militants last year, state TV has said.

However, a monitoring group said the fighting was still outside the city, Reuters news agency reports.
Officials launched an offensive to retake the city earlier this month, backed by Russian air strikes.
The city is situated in a strategically important area between Damascus and the contested eastern city of Deir al-Zour.
IS seized the ruins of Palmyra, a Unesco World Heritage site, and the adjoining modern town in May. It subsequently destroyed two 2,000-year-old temples, an arch and funerary towers, drawing global outrage.
The jihadist group, which has also demolished several world-renowned pre-Islamic sites in neighbouring Iraq, believes that such structures are idolatrous.
Unesco, the UN's cultural agency, has condemned the destruction as a war crime.
State-run news channel Ikhbariya said government fighters had taken over a hotel district in the west of the city. There has been no independent confirmation of the reports.

Why IS destroys ancient sites
State news agency Sana showed warplanes flying overhead, helicopters firing missiles, and soldiers and armoured vehicles approaching Palmyra, Reuters said.
The UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said civilians began fleeing after IS warned them via loudspeakers to leave the city centre as fighting was drawing closer, the agency reported.
Recapturing Palmyra would be a significant victory for the government and Russia, which withdrew most of its forces last week after a six-month air campaign against opponents of President Bashar al-Assad that turned the tide of the five-year civil war in his favour.
The advance on Palmyra comes as representatives of the government and the main opposition umbrella group attend UN-led talks in Geneva aimed at finding a political solution to end the war.
The talks have been boosted by a nationwide cessation of hostilities brokered by the US and Russia that has largely held since it began on 27 February.
IS and its rival jihadist group, al-Nusra Front, are excluded from the truce.
The reduction in violence has also allowed aid to be delivered to besieged areas.
