Ivor Miller jumped from window after being chased by gang

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eight people have admitted charges after a vulnerable man was branded "a beast" and chased until he threw himself out of a flat window.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Ivor Miller was attacked after being chased along two city centre streets.
The 27-year-old tried to hide in two pubs before he fled into a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury.
Sentence on the eight people involved was deferred.
Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder.
Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted.
All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year.
All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm.
Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street.
Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller "a beast" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub.
Judge Norman Ritchie QC told all eight accused: "I regard this as very serious. The complainer is a man who has extreme learning difficulties. This must have been a highly intimidating incident for him."
