England add Exeter Chiefs trio to autumn internationals squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England coach Stuart Lancaster has added Exeter Chiefs trio Dave Ewers, Henry Slade and Thomas Waldrom to his squad for the autumn internationals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lancaster has called up a total of nine additional players in case of injuries.
Northampton pair Ben Foden and Alex Waller are included along with Bath duo Henry Thomas and Anthony Watson.
Matt Kvesic (Gloucester) and Richard Wigglesworth (Saracens) are also in the 41-man party for the matches, which begin with New Zealand on 8 November.
Tom Wood has remained in Northampton with his wife pending the birth of their third child and will join the squad later in the week.
Lancaster said: "We always anticipated bringing in additional players following the European games, either to cover injuries or for training.
"Injuries are inevitable but we are excited about the group we have in camp. We are raring to go and looking forward to getting out on the training pitch."
Billy Vunipola was concussed in Saracens' Champions Cup defeat by Munster on Friday and will follow return-to-play protocols in training over the next week.
Luther Burrell was also withdrawn shortly after half-time of Northampton's victory over the Ospreys with an injury to his right hand.
He is to remain at Saints rather than join up with England's squad at Pennyhill Park with the extent of the damage expected to be known by midweek.
James Haskell continues to be monitored after a virus resulted in his hospitalisation 10 days ago, forcing him to miss Wasps' last two games.

"Luther will be assessed by a specialist over the next 48 hours and our medics are in close contact with Saints so we'll know more in a few days, but it's great to be able to bring in Henry," Lancaster added.
England captain Chris Robshaw says his team-mates will not struggle to motivate themselves for the matches.
"The guys can't wait - the best teams in the world are coming into town, and that's who you want to play, especially at Twickenham," he said.
On being reappointed captain Robshaw added: "It's always a huge honour, something you grab with both hands, and something you are extremely privileged to be doing.
"But it wouldn't be the same if I didn't have the great support around me, the great leaders around me who help me - the character of the squad is second to none."
