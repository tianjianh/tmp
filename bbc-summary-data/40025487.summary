[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nowhere is the bite of the housing crisis felt more keenly than in London.

According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) London's average house price in 2015 was £472,000 - 13.5 times London's average annual wage.
The typical mortgage lets you borrow a maximum of four and a half times your average earnings.
Between 2005 and 2016 average private rents in London rose 38%, while average individual earnings rose just 21%, according to a report by the Mayor of London.
Ahead of the general election BBC London  has taken a look at how the different parties would address three housing issues facing many Londoners.

Marketing manager Hayley Miller moved to London because the "job opportunities here are better than anywhere else".
Despite earning above the national average she says she "doesn't earn enough to see home ownership as an option".
"Above national average, doesn't feel like it in London," she said.
"It's creating that Peter Pan mentality. We work and play but can't settle down here for life."

Housing campaigner Robert spends 47% of his take home pay on renting in Hackney, which creates "never ending financial pressure".
"You're in a period of anxiety waiting for the renewal cost for the letting agent," he said.
In the last two years his rent has increased 23%.
"The main concern for someone in my position and my age is you worry how long you can sustain those rent increases," he added.
The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates 58% of renting households in London - equivalent to 1m households - spend more than a third of their income on rent.
Conservatives
Labour
Liberal Democrats
All three parties say that improving the housing supply will help take the pressure off current private rented stock and help stabilise prices.
Tracy Strassburg: Priced out of London
Tracy, a mother of two boys from Nunhead in south-east London, told the BBC she is being priced out of London.
Despite working as a yoga teacher and receiving £950 a month in housing benefit she struggles to make the £1400 a month she needs to pay for a two bed flat.
She is left borrowing up to £450 a month from her mother and running up debts on credit cards.
Her eldest son, who will turn eight in November, has lived in six different addresses.
She says every time she moves house she has to downsize the property for an increased price.
Each party promises to grow council and local housing association stock, which provide cheaper rents for those in need, which could in turn take pressure off of the private rented sector.
