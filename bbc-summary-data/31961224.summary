The rapper's management has been posting on her accounts since she announced she was taking a break.
In her last Instagram post, she wrote about paparazzi photographers invading her privacy by taking photos of her outside her home in a bikini.
"[It's] so nice not to be on social media so I'm kind of going to continue that until, maybe forever," she said in an interview with the AP news agency.
"I think it's disgusting. I don't think it's nice to stick your camera through somebody's fence and hedge and take a picture of them in their yard and think that's OK at all."
Over the past year Azalea's also been involved in several Twitter spats with the likes of Eminem, Azealia Banks, Nicki Minaj and Snoop Dogg.
Her Great Escape tour was moved from April to September because of "production delays" and she says she's using the extra time to record new music for the follow-up to her debut The New Classic.
Azalea said she didn't want to wait until later in the year to launch the tour but had to because arenas were booked up.
"The whole point was to make no compromises, but nothing's changed in terms of my creative vision," she said.
"It's very kind of like Patrick Nagel, powerful 80s androgynous women vibe.
"I didn't anticipate having any time to completely finish it, but now that I have kind of the time, I'd love to have an album at the end of 2015."
Azalea, 24, said her first single would be her collaboration with Britney Spears, Pretty Girls.
"I love Britney. She's super-sweet and I just want to hang out with her all the time," she said.
"I saw her at Toys R Us randomly. She lives right down the street from me. Since I've met her now we keep bumping into each other in the street.
"I don't know if I needed re-inspiring, but it's just made me extra-excited to want to put out new music."
2014's The New Classic was nominated for best rap album at this year's Grammy Awards with Fancy and Black Widow getting to number five and four respectively on the Official Singles Chart.
"My first album got pushed back so many times and it was probably like two years of recording on and off, but it was a real struggle and I think that was something that really reflected in my album a lot.
"I talk about trying to make it, trying to breakthrough.
"So my second album, now I don't have this problem.
"So I hope it's a little bit more up-tempo and just really fun. I just want to have something so summer and so girly, so loud and obnoxious and braggadocios."
