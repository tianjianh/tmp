Jamie Leek was celebrating his ninth birthday when he was killed crossing a road in Zakynthos in June 2012.
Chris and Lydia Leek, from Clifton, Nottingham, had been celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary on the island.
Last year they asked PM David Cameron to urge the Greek authorities to speed up the prosecution process.
Before flying out on Sunday they said they were "relieved" and "scared".
Mr Leek and his son, Jamie, were hit by a motorbike as they crossed a road. He suffered a broken arm and Jamie died later in hospital.
"I'm not looking forward to going back to the island but I do want to see justice done," he said.
Mrs Leek said: "It's a relief to know that it is finally at rest and that it [the case] has been taken seriously and gone through the procedure that it needs to go through."
The couple will give evidence in the trial of Spiridon Koklas which begins at the Zakynthos Criminal Court on Tuesday.
He is charged with involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and producing a fake driving licence.
