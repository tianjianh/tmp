Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell has offered his services for future party leaders' debates, saying he would "love" to produce them.

"I'd do it in a heartbeat! 100%. I'd have walk-ons, music, fire... and a trap door if people didn't like what they said," he said.
"And I'd definitely have a clap-o-meter. I am deadly serious. I really would love a chance to do that!"
Last month's seven-way party leaders' TV debate got seven million viewers.
Cowell, whose TV talent show became the highest-rated entertainment programme on television last month, was keen to get audiences more involved in the debates.
He also told Radio Times he was not always totally honest when he is judging Britain's Got Talent, especially when children are involved. When asked if he ever lied, he said: "Obviously. Sometimes you have to tell what's called 'a kind lie'.
"With a kid dance act, for example, that's not very good... I obviously can't say what I really think! Especially if they're a bit fragile."
Fellow judge David Walliams, who won the TV judge award at the National Television Awards in January, said he was always truthful, adding: "That's why I'm the nation's favourite. People don't realise we see about 650 people over the series and only one in four of those people make it on to the TV. So there's a hell of a lot of people who are just mediocre."
The pair present the show along with Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon.
