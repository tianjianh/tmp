Craig Whyte and Charles Green charged after Rangers assets sale probe

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte and ex-chief executive Charles Green have been charged with conspiracy and involvement in serious organised crime.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Whitehouse, from administrators Duff and Phelps, faces the same charges while Mr Green, 62,  is also accused of fraud.
An angry crowd of fans shouted abuse as police escorted them from Glasgow Sheriff Court.
All three have been granted bail to return to court at a later date.
The three men were arrested on Tuesday after a police investigation into the sale of Rangers assets in 2012.
Another accountant, 51-year-old Paul Clark, who ran the club while it was in administration, has also been arrested.
Rangers was sold to Craig Whyte by its former owner Sir David Murray in 2011 for a nominal sum of Â£1.
But it entered administration in February 2012 after running out of cash.
Mr Whitehouse, 50, who worked at Duff and Phelps, was appointed as joint administrator, along with colleague Mr Clark.
When an agreement with creditors could not be struck to allow the club to exit administration, a sale of Rangers' assets to a consortium led by Mr Green was concluded.
He was at the helm when Rangers were allowed to join the Third Division but stepped down in 2013 following allegations that he was working in conjunction with Mr Whyte, 44.
Charles Green was shielded by police officers when he left by the front door of the court at around 15:30 BST on Wednesday.
A group of around 20 supporters shouted and tried to jostle the former Sheffield United chief executive.
Mr Whitehouse left the court to equally angry scenes around 20 minutes later.
Craig Whyte, 44, then made his exit just before 19:00 and was met by another angry crowd.
The trio have been charged under Section 28 of the Criminal Justice Licensing Act 2010, which covers serious organised crime offences. They have also been charged with conspiracy.
In addition Mr Green has been charged with fraud and also an offence under Section 190 of the Companies Act 2006.
They made no plea or declaration.
