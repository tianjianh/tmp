New effort to sell Summer Isles' Tanera Mòr

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A tiny island off the north west coast of Scotland has been offered for sale as a whole or in three lots.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 800-acre (323.7ha) Tanera Mòr is the largest and only inhabited island in the Summer Isles in Wester Ross.
Current owners, the Wilder family, bought the island in 1996 and put it back on the market in 2013.
Breaking up the sale into lots is part of a new effort to sell Tanera Mòr, which has a post office and its own stamps for sending mail from the isle.
The guide price for the whole island has been set at almost £2m.
Lot one, the north end of the isle, involves about 231 acres (93ha) and has been priced at £700,000.
It also includes the Summer Isles Post Office which issues two stamps for mail leaving the island - a Tanera Mòr stamp for it to leave the isle to the mainland and a Royal Mail one for the rest of journey.
Tanera Mòr is the only Scottish island to operate a year-round private postal service.
Lot two involves a central area of about 196 (79ha) acres, including Mol Mòr which is the largest of the isle's beaches, and would cost about £430,000 to buy.
In the 1930s, scientist and writer Frank Fraser Darling transformed large parts of moor on this part of the island into fertile land using manure and shell sand
The south of the Tanera Mòr makes up the final lot and involves about 333 acres (134ha) and has a guide price of £820,000.
John Bound, a partner at selling agents CKD Galbraith, said: "The sale of Tanera Mòr offered now as a whole or in three separate lots adds an exciting dynamic to the sale of this idyllic island as it now allows a number of interested parties the chance to tap into island life.
"Each lot offers comfortable family living with some established and potential business opportunities.
"We believe that by offering Tanera Mòr in lots we will attract potential buyers who are looking to buy into the idyllic island lifestyle."
The island was put up for sale after talks were first held about a possible buyout by the local community living on the mainland nearby.
Among the nearest mainland communities and settlements to the Summer Isles include Coigach, Achiltibuie, Ullapool and Lochinver.
