[SN]TITLE[SN]
Peterborough United 2-0 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Marcus Maddison produced a moment of individual genius to clinch victory for Peterborough against Charlton in League One.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The highly-rated wideman doubled his side's lead with a glorious 83rd-minute chip that deceived goalkeeper Declan Rudd and kissed the underside of the bar before dropping into the net.
Maddison also created Posh's opener nine minutes earlier when delivering a pinpoint cross from the right for substitute Martin Samuelsen to nod past Rudd.
The Norway international struck with his second touch of the ball and only 90 seconds after being sent on by manager Grant McCann.
Those goals ensured Posh collected back-to-back league wins for the first time since December, when Charlton were also among their victims.
The Addicks were actually the better side for much of the game but could not manage a breakthrough.
Lee Novak was denied by a fine Jack Baldwin block and a smart Luke McGee save in the first half.
Baldwin also threw himself in front of Ricky Holmes efforts either side of the break as Charlton's miserable run extended to one win in 13 games.
