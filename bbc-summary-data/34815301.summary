The robbery, which happened at a Bank of Scotland branch in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on Wednesday, sparked a bomb scare.
The taxi driver picked up the man from The Avenue in Lochgelly and then made him carry out the robbery at the Mitchelston Industrial Estate branch.
Police said the suspect may have been hanging about in Lochgelly beforehand and had a large blue canvas holdall.
During the robbery, the taxi driver was forced to present a note to bank staff demanding money.
A cashier handed over a four-figure sum but it was later recovered by police at the scene.
A dedicated team of detectives have been checking CCTV footage from surrounding premises and carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
Det Insp Charlie Duncan said: "I believe the male we are looking for may have been hanging about in the area of the small industrial estate on The Avenue, Lochgelly between 12.15pm and 12.40pm on Wednesday, before he was able to get a taxi to take him to Kirkcaldy.
"I believe he was carrying a large blue canvas holdall with distinctive stripes on the corners. This male may have walked to this location from Lochgelly or may have been delivered there by another vehicle."
He added: "I also know the male left the area of Carberry Road, Kirkcaldy, as he has been seen running along Carberry Place, which leads to the rear of the Asda store.
"I believe he may have tried to leave the area immediately and in doing so may have again used a taxi or public transport, which would have been around 2pm.
"I would ask anyone who believes they may have transported this male to come forward."
The suspect was described as being as white, 5ft 6in tall, of heavy build. He was wearing a dark green baseball cap, a dark green scarf, a thick, dark blue jacket, tracksuit bottoms and sunglasses.
He spoke with a distinctive Eastern European accent.
Initial reports from the bank described how a possible explosive device was involved and nearby schools and shops were locked down while officers investigated the scene.
Bomb disposal teams scoured the area but they later confirmed no explosives were involved in the incident, police said.
