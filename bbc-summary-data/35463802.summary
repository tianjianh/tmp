Championship strugglers Charlton have signed Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo on loan until the end of the season.

The 23-year-old Frenchman had been on a season-long loan at Ajax but failed to score in his four appearances for the Eredivisie side.
Ex-France international defender Rod Fanni, 34, has signed from Qatari side Al-Arabi for the rest of the season.
The Addicks have also cancelled the deals of Franck Moussa and Ricardo Vaz Te by mutual consent.
Belgian midfielder Moussa, 26, joined Charlton from Coventry City in the summer of 2014 while ex-Bolton, Barnsley and West Ham forward Vaz Te moved to The Valley in November.
