The export of live animals is expected to resume at the Port of Ramsgate later, protestors say.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lorries carrying livestock are expected at the port at about 22:00 BST, Kent Action Against Live Exports (Kaale) said.
Live animal exports were banned in 2012 after the deaths of more than 40 sheep. The ban by Thanet District Council was later overturned by the High Court.
Kaale said: "We've been told there will be four of five lorries."
Two sheep drowned at Ramsgate in September 2012, and 44 had to be destroyed as they were sick and lame.
The animals were put down after the lorry carrying them was stopped at Ramsgate by animal health inspectors.
Thomas Lomas, director of Kent company Channel Livestock, admitted transporting animals in a way likely to cause undue suffering and in February was given a suspended prison sentence.
In a separate accident, a loading area floor collapsed while the sheep were taken off the lorry, which was carrying 548 animals.
Six fell in the water, with four being rescued by RSPCA officers while two animals drowned.
