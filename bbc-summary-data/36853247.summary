[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emma Baum, who sustained head injuries, was found at the property on Llwyndu Road, Penygroes, on Monday
David Nicholas Davies, 25, from Trefor, Caernarfon, will appear before Caernarfon magistrates on Friday.
A woman has been released on bail after being held on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.
Det Supt Iestyn Davies said :"Despite an individual being charged with murder, increased police presence in the village will continue to provide reassurance and a point of contact for anyone to provide further information.
"Detectives from the investigation team will also continue to conduct inquires locally.
"I'd reiterate my appeal that should anyone have any information that will help us fully understand the sequence of events that led to the discovery of Emma's body then I'd ask they contact us."
