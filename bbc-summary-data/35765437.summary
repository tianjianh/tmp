Second-row George Kruis has promised a "new England" from the side beaten by Wales at the World Cup.

The teams meet at Twickenham in the Six Nations on Saturday for the first time since Wales' momentous group-stage 28-25 victory in September.
England have since won their first three Six Nations matches and Kruis believes new head coach Eddie Jones and his staff have improved the side.
"We're a new team almost," Kruis, 26, told BBC Radio 5 live.
"There are a lot of the same players, but we have a lot of confidence about us, we've been training in different ways, and we have a lot more detail and clarity in our plans.
"The coaches have come in from the start and told us exactly how we want to play.
"So expect something big from us at the weekend."

And Saracens forward Kruis insists England have not dwelt on the World Cup defeat as they prepare for a potential Six Nations title decider at Twickenham against a Wales side with two wins and one draw in the tournament.
"That's definitely a period we have got past now," he added.
"Obviously at the World Cup they got one up on us. But it's not about revenge or anything, we are looking forward and we are pretty confident this weekend."
The battle of the number eights is set to be a fascinating sub-plot on Saturday, with England's in-form Billy Vunipola up against his cousin Taulupe Faletau.
"He's a man who likes to be told exactly what he needs to do, and be put in the positions to do it," Kruis said of his Sarries' team-mate Vunipola.
"He's been phenomenal for us and he's one of many who have been stepping up."
