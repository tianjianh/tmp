[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wakefield moved closer to securing a place in the Super 8s with a scrappy win at struggling Huddersfield Giants.

Constant rain made for a game littered with errors at the John Smith's Stadium, with the visitors 2-0 up at the break through Liam Finn's goal.
Danny Brough kicked the Giants level, but Finn restored Wakefield's lead with his second penalty.
Brough then missed a chance to level the scores before Danny Kirmond's converted try put the Wildcats clear.
The first half was lacking in quality, with Huddersfield driven forward by the kicking of the returning Brough, but they lost winger Aaon Murphy early on with a head wound and they were let down by their handling in attacking areas.
Wakefield were able to exert more control after the break and got the crucial try when Finn kicked towards the posts on the last tackle and Kirmond was able to pounce on the bouncing ball and dive over.
Chris Chester's side recovered from back-to-back defeats to move up to sixth in Super League, with five games remaining before the play-offs begin.
Huddersfield have now lost four of their past five games and remain 11th, eight points below eighth-placed Widnes.
Huddesrfield boss Paul Anderson:  "Aaron Murphy's got a fair old cut in his scalp. He's gone straight to hospital and might need surgery.
"We then lost Ryan Hinchcliffe when he popped a rib cartilage. We were already down on troops and we've lost a couple more today.
"It was a very poor day all round. The game was very ordinary. I didn't think there was much in it.
"We defended our line pretty well, but I thought their kicking game just a bit better than ours."
Wakefield head coach Chris Chester:  "It was a scrappy game, but I thought we kicked the ball very well and our kick-chase was magnificent.
"It was our work off the ball that won us the game, I thought we deserved the win.
"We've been fortunate that other results have gone for us in the last few weeks and this win takes us up into sixth spot.
"Teams below us have to win four out of five which is a big ask but we're not getting carried away."
