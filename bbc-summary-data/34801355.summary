[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hungary took a step towards qualifying for the Euro 2016 finals by beating Norway in their play-off first leg.

The visitors - wearing black armbands in tribute to former goalkeeper Marton Fulop, who died on Thursday - scored the only goal when debutant Laszlo Kleinheisler smashed in from 15 yards.
In an open and entertaining game, Norway had 21 efforts on goal but could not find a way past Gabor Kiraly.
Hungary have not qualified for a major tournament since the 1986 World Cup.
The two sides will meet in Budapest on Sunday in the second leg with a place at next summer's finals in France at stake.
Only one team have qualified through the play-offs after losing the first leg since their inception for Euro 96 - Netherlands hammering Scotland 6-0 in 2003 after losing in Glasgow.
Kiraly - winning his 100th cap - was a key man throughout, making an outstanding early save to deny Norway skipper Per Ciljan Skjelbred and later dropping a corner which was eventually cleared off the line.
The hosts, who have not been to a major finals since Euro 2000, were on top in the early stages but conceded when 21-year-old Kleinheisler fired in a left-footed drive which goalkeeper Orjan Nyland could not keep out.
Norway piled on the pressure in the second half but found former Crystal Palace keeper Kiraly in inspired form, while Premier League referee Mark Clattenburg denied them a penalty when he instead booked Omar Elabdellaoui for a dive.
In the 88th minute, another Kiraly save kept out Alexander Soderlund, with substitute Pal Andre Heland heading the rebound against the crossbar.
