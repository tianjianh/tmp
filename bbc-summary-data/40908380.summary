[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tynesiders led after just five minutes when Fraser Kerr prodded in Richard Peniket's centre at the far post. It was initially adjudged offside by the linesman, the but referee overruled him.
Scott Wilson nearly equalised for the Silkmen with a 25-yard low shot, but James Montgomery was down sharply to deny him.
At the other end, Kerr was also involved in Gateshead's second just before the half-time whistle, sending in a vicious corner for Jordan Burrow to head in.
After the break, Peniket released Jordan Preston, and the striker slotted calmly past Billy O'Brien for number three.
