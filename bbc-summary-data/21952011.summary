Ivan Emmanuel Campbell, 73, a resident at Victoria Nursing Home in Anson Road, Rusholme, died from internal injuries.
Police were called to the home by staff who found the man injured last April.
The employee, 34, was also held on suspicion of assaulting a 72-year-old resident, who suffered a fractured rib in an incident on 19 March.
An investigation has been under way since the death of Mr Campbell, involving Manchester City Council, the NHS, Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust and the Care Quality Commission.
When the CQC inspected the home a month after Mr Campbell's death it reported: "People who used the service were not fully protected from effects of abuse or exploitation within the home."
Inspectors flagged up problems with staff training and said managers had failed to ensure they "followed up new information available about established staff, and that every one working in the home could be accurately identified".
In a follow up visit last October, inspectors said the home had improved in all seven areas previously of concern and "now had effective systems in place to identify, assess, and manage risks to health, safety, and welfare".
The private home caters for 21 residents, some with mental health needs as well as other medical conditions.
Greater Manchester Police's Andy Tattersall said: "Due to the complex needs of those at the care home this has and continues to be an extremely difficult and protracted investigation.
"From the outset we were determined to establish what happened to Ivan and who was responsible for causing his injuries and that remains as true today as it did then.
"I want to reassure the relatives of residents there that their welfare is, collectively between us and our partners, a top priority."
