Prosecutors say two other men were arrested in the same raid in a Brussels suburb. A fourth was also detained.
Abrini is a suspect in the Paris terror attacks of 13 November, but media say he is also believed to be the "man in the hat" seen shortly before the twin bombing at Brussels airport on 22 March.
