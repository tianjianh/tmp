Huddersfield Town v Aston Villa

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huddersfield Town are hopeful that goalkeeper Danny Ward will be fit after going off with a knock in the weekend home defeat by Newcastle.

Midfielder Phillip Billing is also a doubt, which may mean that former Aston Villa man Jonathan Hogg could come in.
Villa will be without midfielders Birkir Bjarnason and Jack Grealish, who both picked up knee injuries in Saturday's win at Rotherham.
Boss Steve Bruce could use full-back Jordan Amavi in a more advanced role.
Villa are now looking a lot safer having climbed to 13th after three straight wins - all of them clean sheets.
