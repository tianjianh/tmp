Celtic fan accused of singing 'pro-IRA' songs at Dundee match

A Celtic fan has appeared in court accused of singing pro-IRA songs at the side's Boxing Day match with Dundee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dion McLeish was arrested at Dens Park stadium on Wednesday night after widespread disturbances in the Bob Shankly stand.
The 19-year-old denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Elizabeth Munro set a trial date for March, and banned the teenager from attending any of Celtic's away matches before then.
Following the game, Dundee FC officials said the scenes at the game were a "throwback to the 70s" and that fans and stewards were abused as Celtic supporters fought among themselves.
Celtic have apologised over their fans' behaviour, and vowed to identify all involved.
Mr McLeish, from Clydebank, is accused of engaging in offensive behaviour which was "likely to incite public disorder".
He is alleged to have "sang a song in support of a proscribed terrorist organisation" during the match.
The 19-year-old was one of four fans arrested at the match, with a further supporter being reported to the procurator fiscal.
He pled not guilty to a charge brought under section 1(1) of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012.
Fiscal depute Lynne Mannion asked the court to ban Mr McLeish from all matches ahead of a trial date in the New Year.
But Jack Brown, defending, said his client had paid Â£500 for a Celtic season ticket this year and would lose out if he was banned from all games.
