Wenger, 66, celebrates 20 years as Arsenal boss next month and is out of contract in the summer of 2017.
According to L'Equipe, PSG tried to recruit him in 2011, 2013 and 2014.
Asked why he had turned PSG down, Wenger said: "I always remained loyal to Arsenal because it's a club that has the qualities I love - and that's why."
Arsenal have won three league titles and six FA Cups during Wenger's reign.
However, they have not won the Premier League since 2003-04 and some fans have called for Wenger to leave.
PSG have been crowned French champions for the past four seasons and have reached the Champions League quarter-finals four times in a row.
Beaten in the last eight by Manchester City earlier this year, they are backed by wealthy owners Qatari Sports Investments, who Wenger says he "knows well".
The Frenchman added: "PSG are a good test for us. They're a team who are, in France, the team above everyone else."
Arsenal are seventh in the Premier League, with seven points from four games. PSG are seventh in Ligue 1, with seven points from four games.
Swiss side Basel entertain Bulgarian outfit Ludogorets in the other Group A contest on Tuesday.
