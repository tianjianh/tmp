The two sides meet in a Championship play-off semi-final first leg on Sunday 1 May, with the second leg on 8 May.
The 29-year-old back row will now not feature in the play-offs.
"I appreciate supporters will feel very disappointed but the club has been put in a compromising position due to Nick's decision," Bedford chairman Geoff Irvine told the club website.
"As such, we feel that this is the correct course of action to take given the circumstances."
Bristol finished the regular Championship season top of the table, with Bedford fourth.
South Africa-born Fenton-Wells joined Bedford from Saracens two years ago and was named captain in 2014.
