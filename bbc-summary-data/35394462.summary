Sydney Thunder won the inaugural Women's Big Bash League after edging city rivals Sydney Sixers by three wickets in a tense final in Melbourne.

Sixers had posted a modest total of 115-7 from their 20 overs at the MCG.
Rachael Haynes (37) gave Thunder a good start but was one of three players run out as they slumped from 100-2 to 113-7 in the space of two overs.
But with three balls remaining, they clinched the win when Ellyse Perry bowled a wide and Thunder ran a bye.
The last remaining England player in the tournament was Sixers all-rounder Laura Marsh, but the Kent spinner was not selected for the final.
While there were plenty of nerves on show from both sides in the final, with catches dropped and run-out chances missed, Cricket Australia will be delighted with the staging of the highest profile domestic tournament in the history of women's cricket, with interest and viewing figures having exceeded expectations.
England skipper Charlotte Edwards and vice-captain Heather Knight finished second and third respectively in the voting for the player of the tournament award, which was won by Australia and Melbourne Stars captain Meg Lanning, the leading run-scorer.
Thunder later completed a double when they beat Melbourne Stars in the men's Big Bash League final, also at the MCG.
