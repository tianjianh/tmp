Signed copy of Hitler's Mein Kampf up for auction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An "extremely rare" signed copy of Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf is to be sold at auction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The blue cloth-covered 1935 edition bears the Nazi dictator's signature on the front fly leaf.
It was presented to former BBC and Oxford Mail journalist Peter Cadogan during a visit to Munich in the late 1930s.
It will be sold at Silverwoods auction house in Clitheroe, Lancashire, and is expected to raise more than Â£1,000.
Auctioneer James Thompson said some people "wouldn't touch anything Nazi with a bargepole", but others believe the book should be preserved, despite Hitler's appalling reign.
"In a way, it's a way to touch a monster," he said.
Mein Kampf, which translates as My Struggle, was first published in 1925 and sets out Hitler's political ideology and plans for Germany.
The example being sold is thought to be especially rare because Hitler was known to resist signing documents of any kind.
Journalist Mr Cadogan had been acquainted with Unity Mitford, a member of Hitler's inner circle of devotees. It was she who asked Hitler to sign it for him.
"Hitler didn't sign books. It wasn't something he did. He did it this time on the request of Unity Mitford. You can almost see him putting his eyes to the ceiling," Mr Thompson added.
The book is now being sold at the request of Mr Cadogan's family.
The Rev Dr Stuart Jennings, a historian at the University of Warwick, said: "It's very interesting because it was very difficult to get Hitler to sign anything at all.
"There is nothing to connect him in writing to the final solution.
"There's an interesting social history behind how the book came to be here. After the war and the Nuremberg trials there was a great effort to destroy anything connected to the Third Reich.
"There was a concerted effort to make sure there could be nothing there for idol worship. Even Hitler's bunker was bulldozed over."
