The wide receiver broadcasted on Facebook after the Steelers' 18-16 win against Kansas Chiefs on Sunday, breaching NFL social media rules.
In the clip, Tomlin refers to their next opponents New England Patriots using an expletive.
"It was foolish of him to do that, it was selfish of him," said Tomlin.
"Not only is it a violation of our policy, but it is a violation of league policy, both of which he knows. So there are consequences to be dealt with."
NFL policy prevents players using social media on game day, from 90 minutes before kick-off until after the locker room is open to the media after the game. Any breach is punishable with a fine.
Brown, 28, apologised on Twitter on Wednesday, posting: "I let my emotions and genuine excitement get the best of me and I wanted to share that moment with our fans. It was wrong of me to do, against team and NFL policy."
The player also drew criticism for breaking a locker room code of conduct.
"It's an unfortunate situation that we've got to deal with right now," Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger told 93.7 The Fan. "That's a sacred place where things are said and hugs and tears, and it's kind of a special place."
The Steelers play the Patriots on Sunday in the AFC Conference Championship, with the winners going to the Superbowl.
