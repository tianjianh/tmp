Pat Hoban could have put Boro ahead, but his shot from the edge of the area was well saved by Jamie Jones.
Harrold gave the visitors the lead moments later, firing low past Jones from Roarie Deacon's cross.
Tom Pett squandered the best chance of an equaliser when he shot wide from inside the box, as Stevenage's winless run was extended to nine matches.
Stevenage caretaker manager Darren Sarll told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"The most frustrating afternoon, no fairytale ending unfortunately. I thought the game was frustrating as a whole, but I thought in the first half we were very comfortable. I thought the goal was one of the only efforts they had on target.
"I was quite happy and content at 30-odd minutes. To concede the goal before half-time just changes the complexion of things. I think the second half was nowhere near the standard we need to attain.
"We need to improve, the club needs to improve, the team needs to improve. I think it's important that we understand that there are improvements that need to be made."
Crawley Town boss Mark Yates told BBC Surrey:

"We just needed a performance of hard work, grit, determination, organisation and I got that.
"We played the conditions rather than worrying about too much and it was vital to stick together to get the result.
"We talked about platforms and building blocks to put into place to make sure that when we go to Accrington next week that we're in a good frame of mind and in a good place. The confidence the players will get from that will be massive."
