A teenager who was spared jail after admitting raping a 12-year-old girl has been remanded in custody after breaching his community payback order.

Conor Bull, 19, from Stranraer, walked free from court in 2014 after judge Lord Burns decided not to jail him.
However, he was brought back to court after breaching the order imposed as a direct alternative to a jail sentence.
Lord Burns said there was now no option to a jail term and remanded him in custody with his sentence deferred.
Bull raped the schoolgirl in December 2013 and later boasted of what he had done to a friend.
The High Court in Glasgow heard that Bull - as part of the court order imposed on him - was told not to use mobile phones or access social media or have contact with girls under the age of 15.
Defence counsel Simon Gilbride told the court: "Mr Bull has admitted he had use of mobile phones and had access to social media.
"However, he disputes using Snapchat to regularly contact young girls."
The court heard that this was the second time Bull had breached the order.
He appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh on 15 July and admitted a breach of the order. Then on 28 July - less than two weeks after the court appearance - he again breached it.
Lord Burns said: "I said if there were a breach I would have no option, but a custodial sentence. I am bound to impose a custodial sentence."
He told Bull: "Conor Bull you have given me no option but to find you in breach. You accept you are in breach for the second time."
He also ordered a report to assess the risk he posed.
Bull was remanded in custody and sentence deferred until 2 November at the High Court in Aberdeen.
In 2014, Bull admitted the rape and Lord Burns placed him on a community payback order and told him to perform 101 hours unpaid work.
At the time Lord Burns said: "The public interest does not require a custodial sentence."
