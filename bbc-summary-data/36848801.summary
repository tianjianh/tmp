[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Key quotes from high-profile European and other figures on Britain's vote to leave the EU, as compiled by BBC Monitoring between 14 and 21 July.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
"Nobody wants a long period of limbo. Neither the British people nor the European member states. Everyone has an interest that the preparations are conducted in a thorough manner, that the positions are clear, and I think it is absolutely understandable that Britain needs a certain amount of time for this." (Joint news conference with Theresa May, 20 July, via Reuters)
"I think we can expect that Britons will act as quickly as possible to end this period of uncertainty in Britain and in Europe." (Interview with Reuters, 20 July)
"Despite Brexit, we need the cooperation with Britain in our international relations, particularly in these times of crisis." (Interview with Reuters, 20 July)
"The faster clarity is created, the better it is for limiting the possible risks." (Speaking after a meeting with US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew in Berlin, 14 July, as reported by Handelsblatt)
"As Britain and the EU begin negotiating the new terms of their partnership, America is rooting for and will do all we can to try to encourage and assist in the development of the smoothest possible transition and a highly integrated and collaborative EU/UK relationship." (News conference with Boris Johnson, via Express)
"The British have told us that they can't sign any kind of new trade agreement... until they are no longer a member of the EU. So there is a time period here no matter what, the process that may take at least a couple of years before anyone can contemplate some kind of agreement." (News conference with Boris Johnson, via Reuters)
"The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union happens under good conditions, but not to the EU's detriment. It is not a question of weakening Europeans." (about Boris Johnson, interview with French Europe 1 radio, 14 July)
"I am not at all worried about Boris Johnson, but you know very well what his style, his method is... Did you see what his style was during the campaign? He lied a lot to the British. Now it is he who is up against it in terms of defending his country, as well as for ensuring that the relationship with Europe is clear." (about Boris Johnson, interview with French Europe 1 radio, 14 July)
"At first I thought it was a joke. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. But I know that it's not a good thing if irresponsibility in politics is rewarded." (About Boris Johnson's appointment as foreign secretary, 14 July, statement on her website)
"The discussion and negotiations that take place over the next period should take into account the possibility, however far out it might be, that the clause in the Good Friday Agreement might be triggered, in that if there is a clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the United Kingdom and join the Republic, that should be catered for in the discussions. Because if that possibility were to happen, you would have Northern Ireland wishing to leave the United Kingdom, not being a member of the European Union, and joining the Republic, which will be a member of the EU." (Speaking to reporters on 19 July, via the Irish Independent)
"Told PM @Theresa_May today that we need an orderly, calm #Brexit, something like a 'velvet divorce'." (Tweet after talks with Theresa May on the telephone, 19 July)
"Japan will try and cooperate [with Britain during the Brexit process]. We will convey our thoughts to the British government to help minimise the damage to its economy." (Speaking to the Japanese news agency Kyodo, 19 July, via The Mainichi)
