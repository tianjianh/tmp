Hampshire Police said the burglary happened on Hayling Island overnight on 18 April between 22:30 BST and 06:00 BST.
The burglar took a handbag, a set of car keys, and an Audi Quattro S3 worth Â£30,000.
The urn containing the ashes - which was in the car - was later left outside the woman's back door.
Det Con Jamie Fagan said: "The ashes of the lady's late mother were carefully left outside the back door.
"Whoever is responsible may have returned at a different time to do this after the burglary had taken place."
