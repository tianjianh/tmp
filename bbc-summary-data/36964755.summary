The 30-year-old had become a free agent after terminating his contract with Shrewsbury on Monday.
Barnett finished last season on loan at Southend United, where he scored five goals in 20 appearances.
"We wanted another target man and someone with strength, power and real quality," Dons boss Neal Ardley told BBC Radio London.
Barnett, who has also played for Macclesfield and Crawley and spent time on loan at Ipswich, Bristol City and Oxford United, becomes Wimbledon's seventh signing of the summer transfer window.
The Dons have not disclosed the length of his contract at Kingsmeadow.
