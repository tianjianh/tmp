Patrick Roberts put Celtic ahead after only three minutes, but County responded well and almost equalised when Andrew Davies' header hit the post.
Stuart Armstrong coolly slotted home to double Celtic's lead on 83 minutes.
Substitutes Scott Sinclair and Moussa Dembele added goals in stoppage time to add some gloss to the scoreline.
The win takes Celtic seven points clear of Aberdeen - who slipped up with defeat at Hamilton on Tuesday - at the top of the Premiership table.
Celtic made eight changes to their line-up with manager Brendan Rodgers perhaps looking at their schedule and feeling it was time to rest some players.
They came out of the blocks firing and took the initiative immediately when Armstrong's desire to press won the ball in a dangerous area.
He released Roberts who danced inside and curled a beautiful effort into the far corner.
County responded quickly though with Liam Boyce, back in the side after injury, pained to see Craig Gordon's boot deflect his shot wide when clean through on goal.
Armstrong, Leigh Griffiths, Roberts and Ryan Christie all went close to a second. It did not arrive until late on and County will feel very unlucky not to have levelled.
Martin Woods, Davies and Boyce all had good efforts as the home side grew into the game.
Celtic appeared to have regained their dominance early in the second half but County continued to battle.
Ryan Dow shot straight at Gordon before Davies towered to power a header towards goal which struck the inside of the post and away.
Celtic's introduction of Dembele, Sinclair and Bitton reflected County's increasing influence.
When Gordon came racing out of his box and clattered into Boyce it seemed a red card would emerge.
It didn't, much to the fury of Jim McIntyre who could not believe the goalkeeper had escaped with a yellow.
Dembele should have settled it but Scott Fox brilliantly saved before Roberts fed the impressive Armstrong who calmly fired into the corner.
Sinclair missed a sitter before finally ending the contest in injury time with a great finish before Dembele added insult to injury with a fourth.
It was very harsh on Ross County who put so much in to making the match the spectacle it was.
For Celtic, another win, a significant gap at the top of the Premiership and cries of "Championees" ringing out from the away end in October.
