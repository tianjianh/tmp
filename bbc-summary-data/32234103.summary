'New' Cezanne sketches to go on show in Philadelphia

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A pair of previously unseen sketches by Paul Cezanne are to go on display in Philadelphia following their discovery on the back of two watercolours.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
According to the Barnes Foundation, they were uncovered during conservation work on two Cezanne paintings depicting the landscape of southern France.
Officials say the sketches have not been seen since the early 20th Century.
They will be on view in double-sided frames at the Foundation's Philadelphia base from 10 April until 18 May.
One of the sketches is in graphite, while the other was done using watercolours.
Following the display of both views to the public, the watercolours are to be returned to their original locations on the walls of the Barnes.
Impressionist painter Cezanne, who died in 1906 at the age of 61, is regarded as a major influence on 20th Century artists like Matisse and Picasso.
