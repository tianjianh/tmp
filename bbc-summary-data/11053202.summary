Comedian Tim Vine has won a prize for the funniest joke of this year's Edinburgh Fringe.

The pun pundit, who won the Perrier newcomer award in 1995, was presented with his latest prize by digital TV channel Dave.
His winning one-liner was: "I've just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I'll tell you what, never again."
The award was judged by eight comedy critics, whose shortlist of 24 jokes went forward to a public vote.
The top 10 festival funnies were judged to be:
1) Tim Vine "I've just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I'll tell you what, never again."
2) David Gibson "I'm currently dating a couple of anorexics. Two birds, one stone."
Funniest gag: Your jokes
3) Emo Philips "I picked up a hitch hiker. You've got to when you hit them."
4) Jack Whitehall "I bought one of those anti-bullying  wristbands when they first came out. I say 'bought', I actually stole it off a short, fat ginger kid."
5) Gary Delaney "As a kid I was made to walk the plank. We couldn't afford a dog."
6) John Bishop "Being an England supporter is like being the over-optimistic parents of the fat kid on sports day."
7) Bo Burnham "What do you call a kid with no arms and an eyepatch? Names."
8) Gary Delaney "Dave drowned. So at the funeral we got him a wreath in the shape of a lifebelt. Well, it's what he would have wanted."
9) Robert White "For Vanessa Feltz, life is like a box of chocolates: Empty."
10) Gareth Richards "Wooden spoons are great. You can either use them to prepare food. Or, if you can't be bothered with that, just write a number on one and walk into a pubâ€¦"
Competition organisers Dave said each judge sat through an average of 60 performances, totalling 3,600 minutes of comedy material.
They may only have skimmed the surface, however. The Fringe website lists 883 comedy shows taking place during the festival's month-long run.
Tim Vine, whose brother is BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy, is appearing in Edinburgh with his stand-up show, The Joke-amotive.
A regular guest in Countdown's dictionary corner, he once held the world record for the most jokes told in an hour, after delivering 499 quips in 60 minutes (the current holder is Australian comic Anthony Lehmann, who managed 549).
On receiving his prize, Vine said: "I am very happy to win this award and I'm going to celebrate by going to Sooty's barbecue and having a sweepsteak".
Judges also selected some of the worst jokes of this year's Fringe, which included:
Sara Pascoe "Why did the chicken commit suicide? To get to the other side."
Sean Hughes "You know city-centre beat officers... Well are they police who rap?"
John Luke Roberts "I made a Battenberg where the two colours ran alongside each other. I called it apartheid sponge."
Emo Phillips "I like to play chess with bald men in the park although it's hard to find 32 of them."
Bec Hill "Some of my best friends are vegan. They were going to come today but they didn't have the energy to climb up the stairs."
Dan Antopolski "How many Spaniards does it take to change a lightbulb? Juan."
Antopolski's inclusion in the "worst joke" list comes just a year after he won the Dave trophy.
His winning joke was: "Hedgehogs - why can't they just share the hedge?"
