[SN]TITLE[SN]
Barnet 0-0 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Barnet extended their unbeaten run in League Two to five games as they drew 0-0 with Crewe, although they had chances to win the game late on.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After an even half hour, Barnet almost went behind when fit-again Alex captain Ryan Lowe latched onto a Bondz Ngala back-pass but Jamie Stephens was alert enough to prevent disaster.
Ryan Watson went closest in the first half for the Bees, his header flying just wide of the far post.
Crewe thought they had taken the lead just after the break when Lowe tapped in from close range only for the linesman to rule it out for offside.
Barnet boss Martin Allen threw on Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro and the home side looked much more threatening, John Akinde and Michael Nelson both having headers cleared off the line inside the last 10 minutes.
In-form striker Akinde had a chance to seal all three points with the last kick of the game but he blazed wide when clean through on goal.
