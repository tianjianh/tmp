Dublin: Jackie Kennedy's silk maternity dress for sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cream silk maternity dress worn by former US first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in 1960 is to be auctioned in the Republic of Ireland in May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dress was worn when Jackie was expecting her son, John Kennedy Jr.
It was a gift that Jacqueline gave to the Kennedys' White House English nanny Maud Shaw.
She was with the family from 1957 and helped look after Caroline and John when their father was assassinated in 1963.
Maud Shaw retired to England and Jackie and the children visited her there in 1965.
"The dress is empire line, sleeveless and has an oriental pattern in silk," said Stuart Purcell, head of collectables at Whyte's auction house in Dublin.
"There was a suggestion that the dress was a gift from the Japanese embassy in Washington."
Mr Purcell said Maud Shaw became quite famous at the time of John F Kennedy's funeral.
When she retired, she wrote a book about her time with the Kennedys:  White House Nanny: My Years with Caroline and John Kennedy Jr.
In the last chapter, she said she was given the dress and other mementos when Jackie and the children visited
After her death in 1988, the mementos were left to family and eventually sold on.
The dress and a collection of photographs of Maud Shaw's time with the Kennedys will be sold at Whyte's history and literature auction on 9 May.
The estimate price is 3,500 (Â£2,500) to 4,000 euro (Â£2,880).
