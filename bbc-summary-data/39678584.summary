Jonny Hayes scored the crucial goal, with the help of a big deflection off Darren McGregor, as Derek McInnes' men won 3-2.
The Pittodrie men had gone 2-0 up thanks to goals from Adam Rooney and Ryan Christie but a Grant Holt header and Dylan McGeouch's excellent goal hauled Hibs level.
Here, former Hibs captain Craig Paterson and former Aberdeen skipper Russell Anderson rate the players on show at Hampden.
He didn't have a chance with the first and third goals, and his wall didn't help him at the second. Almost scored an equaliser when he came up at the end.
Got forward when he could and defended well against a top player in Jonny Hayes.
A rare mistake from Darren for Aberdeen's opening goal and he was very unlucky when Hayes' winner deflected off him. In between those incidents he was his usual solid self.
He has been excellent since coming to Easter Road and did nothing wrong at Hampden. Battled on despite struggling after half time with an allergic reaction.
Did exactly what Lewis Stevenson does - he churned out yet another solid performance.
He sent in a magnificent cross for Holt's goal and proved a threat all afternoon.
Strange to see him giving the ball away for Aberdeen's opener but the midfielder then did everything he could to get Hibs back into the game.
A colossus for Neil Lennon's side. Bartley gets on with the hard work and graft to get the ball back whenever Hibs lose it.
Unlucky to be subbed early on and the fact he had been booked may have been the deciding factor.
Didn't cover himself in glory at Aberdeen's second when he broke away from the two-man wall but he scored a great goal to make it 2-2.
He worked hard and is clearly Hibs' best finisher, but he didn't get a look at goal today.
The big striker turned the game when he came on, scoring the first and setting up the second. Couldn't have done much better.
Didn't make any impact on the game.
Wasn't on for long enough to make an impact.
The keeper did what he had to do and had no chance with any of Hibs' goals.
He backed up the play whenever he could and also defended well when called upon. A solid performance.
Didn't have much to do early on but when Hibs turned the screw he stood up very well to their attacks. Consistent as usual.
He defended well up against a very good striker in Jason Cummings but found it tougher once Holt came on for Hibs. Made a great late challenge that sealed the win.
Worked well alongside Taylor in dealing with Cummings but found it more difficult after the introduction of Holt.
Started further up the pitch than usual and showed great energy to win the ball for the first goal. That was typical of his showing throughout.
At times he was very good. He played slightly deeper again to try to control the game and his passing was excellent.
He scored the second goal and he takes great credit for going for the near post to surprise Hibs.
He was solid and showed a fine range of passing when Aberdeen were well in control of the game. Nice and composed.
Tried to get at Hibs whenever he could and was a threat with his pace all day. Got lucky for the winning goal after getting himself into a great position.
Started off brilliantly and produced a composed finish to fire Aberdeen into the early lead. Offered plenty when Aberdeen were dominating but feel out of the game as it went on,
Did well in the physical battle with Holt and provided a great pass for Hayes at the winner.
He carried the ball well and fitted perfectly into the shape when he came on.
