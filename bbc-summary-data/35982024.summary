Water fleas launched into space for Tim Peake experiment

Water fleas will be launched to the International Space Station on Friday as part of an experiment conceived by Welsh school pupils.

The crustaceans will be on their way to British astronaut Maj Tim Peake following a launch scheduled from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 21:43 BST.
Maj Peake will see how they reproduce in space and whether they can survive.
Six youngsters from Rhondda Cynon Taff came up with the idea to win Mission Discovery 2013.
This is a project which allows secondary school students to carry out biomedical research with NASA astronauts and rocket scientists.
Astronaut Mike Foale - the first Briton to perform a space walk - worked on the project with Liam Collins-Jones, Rhiannydd Thomas, Sion Phillips and Trystan Gruffydd from Ysgol Gyfun Garth Olwg in Church Village, Georgia Bailey from Tonyrefail School and Ieuan Williams from Aberdare High School.
The water fleas, or Daphnia, have been taken from a pond at the University of Birmingham and experts helped with the more technical aspects of the challenge.
The idea is if they can survive in space, their complex genetic systems will open the doors to research there.
Chris Barber, director of the International Space School Educational Trust, said: "Mission Discovery gives ordinary young people the chance to do something extraordinary.
"We are incredibly pleased to be enabling such amazing opportunities for school students in south Wales."
Two experiments have already been sent to the ISS and the water fleas are among five on board the rocket being launched.
The water fleas were originally due to be sent in June last year, but ISSET said the explosion of three separate US rockets delayed the human space programme.
