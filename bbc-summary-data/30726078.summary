The four-time Olympic champion will try to break the individual world hour record as part of his build-up to Rio with Team Wiggins.
"Cycling has given me everything," said the 34-year-old.
"I want to build something to inspire kids and to reach all those people who might be on the fringes of the sport."
He added: "My message is simple: if I can do it, then so can you."

The team will feature young British talent including England's Andy Tennant, Jon Dibben, Steven Burke, Daniel Patten and Mike Thompson, Welshman Owain Doull, Mark Christian of the Isle of Man and Scotland's Iain Paton.
The team's calendar of UK track and road events will be unveiled in spring 2015.
Team Wiggins will operate independently of British Cycling, but the governing body has given its backing to the outfit, which aims to provide opportunities for British riders to gain experience and track time together in the build-up to Rio 2016.
British Cycling chief executive Ian Drake said Wiggins has "helped to inspire a new generation of British cyclists".
He added: "Sir Bradley won his first Olympic medal in Sydney in 2000 and it's impressive to see him still breaking new ground now, 15 years later with his Wiggins team."
Wiggins will continue to ride with Team Sky until April, before switching his focus to the track and his Olympic bid.
