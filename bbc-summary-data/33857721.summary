[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Birmingham City moved into the Championship top six with a first win in four league games to increase the pressure on struggling Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Michael Morrison headed in a second-half corner before Clayton Donaldson grabbed a second goal in injury time.
Brentford, who sacked head coach Marinus Dijkhuizen on Monday. were beaten on home soil at Griffin Park for the second time in four days
Alan Judge struck the bar late on with Brentford's best chance of the game.
New Brentford boss Lee Carsley was unable to prevent the Bees suffering a defeat against one of his former clubs.
The former Republic of Ireland international was handed the job until the end of the season when Dutchman Dijkhuizen left Griffin Park after just nine games in charge.
Carsley's side started positively and Marco Djuricin should have tested Tomasz Kuszczak in the Birmingham goal twice before half-time only to shoot wide from inside the area and have a shot from a Jake Bidwell cross well saved.
David Cotterill had the visitors' best chance of the half but his header was saved by David Button before
Centre-back Morrison did put Birmingham ahead after the break, rising at the back post to head in Cotterill's corner.
Judge struck the woodwork from the edge of the box as a helpless Kuszczak watched on, while at the other end Blues substitute Jacques Maghoma shot over from close range.
But Donaldson finally doubled the lead in stoppage time against his former club, racing on to Stephen Gleeson's long ball and lofting it over an onrushing Button.

"We did okay in the first half but didn't really carry much threat. There's a lack of confidence and that's the hardest thing in football.
"We have players here who are new to the English game and we need to give them a bit of time.
"I would rather lose 2-0 trying to get something out of the game, so if Alan Judge's shot goes in off the bar then it's a different story. I was disappointed that we went a little ragged after they scored but we have some good players here and they will go on to have a great season."
Birmingham boss Gary Rowett:

"We knew Brentford would have lot of possession but we are quite happy with teams doing that and we kept our shape and asserted control in second half.
"Gradually we grew into the game and had far more clear cut chances than them. We have some clever players in there who know the game and as it went on our fitness levels got better and better and we attacked well and thoroughly deserved our two goals.
"We could have expected Brentford to bounce back for their new manager but we quelled that and took our chances when we needed to.
"We kept our shape and discipline and in the end I thought we were quite comfortable winners."
