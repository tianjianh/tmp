Mark Cope targeted the "quiet, shy and naive" girl online and travelled from his home in Birmingham to meet her.
Police found the pair at a hotel and arrested Cope, who had twice had sex with the girl, Teesside Crown Court heard.
The 26-year-old, of Shirrall Grove, was sentenced to seven years in prison and a further six on licence.
In a statement the girl's family said they had felt "devastated, angry and upset".
"As parents you just want to protect your children and you presume that you know everything that goes on," the family said.
They urged other parents to be "vigilant" and to remind children of the dangers of talking to strangers online.
Cope previously admitted two charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, one charge of abducting a child and two charges of sexual activity with a child.
The court heard prior to meeting her, Cope told the girl they were boyfriend and girlfriend, that they would go away together on holiday and that he would "knock out her father" if he tried to stop them.
If she refused to do what he asked during their video conversations on Skype, he would get angry and tell her he would see other girls instead, the court heard.
The "campaign of grooming" had begun while Cope lived with his partner in Wales and continued when he moved to live with his mother in Birmingham, the court heard.
At sentencing, Judge Simon Phillips QC read out a report describing him as a "meticulous planner with no social awareness or correct moral boundaries".
He said he had "no concept of the harm you have caused the victim or her family" and posed a "massive risk to your victim and anyone who stands in your way".
"Your persistent and very wrongful abuse of this child only ended when the police came to the hotel and arrested you."
Cope was indefinitely banned from entering the boundaries of Teesside and placed on the sexual offenders register.
