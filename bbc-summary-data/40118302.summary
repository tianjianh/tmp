The 31-year-old has played more than 50 games for Rovers since arriving from Mansfield in the summer of 2015.
Sutton's season was cut short by an Achilles injury which kept him out for the final six weeks.
"I'm very pleased that Ritchie is remaining at the club to help us build on the togetherness of the squad from last season," said boss Micky Mellon.
