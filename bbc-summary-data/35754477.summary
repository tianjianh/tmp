[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The unnamed male calf was the born to Curraghs Wildlife Park's resident pair Louka and Thackery.
Tapirs are currently listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species.
General manager Kathleen Graham said the new tapir is "quite a star". People can suggest a name for the calf on the park's Facebook page.
Tapirs are born with spots and stripes which provide camouflage when out in the forests of Brazil.
The tapir family's closest relatives are rhinos and horses and they have distinctive snouts but as they get older their markings fade.
Tapirs live in the wild in jungle and forest lands in Central and South America as well as in South East Asia.
