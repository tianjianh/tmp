Mackail-Smith, 33, was let go after scoring five goals in 18 appearances on loan at Peterborough last season.
The striker has scored 171 career goals during a career spent with Dagenham, Peterborough, Brighton and Luton.
"Craig could be the final piece in the jigsaw for us and I'm over the moon to bring him here," Wycombe manager Gareth Ainsworth told the club website.
"He's got talent and a pedigree which are above this level and I've no doubt he will strengthen the options we have in our frontline."
Mackail-Smith is Wycombe's fourth summer signing after Adam El-Abd, Nathan Tyson and Jack Williams and could make his debut against Notts County in League Two on Saturday.
