Cardiff City defender Sol Bamba has had an extra game added on to his two-match ban for violent conduct and will miss their Boxing Day trip to Brentford.

Bamba, 31, was charged by the FA for violent conduct following his sending off at Ipswich Town on 10 December.
"The main charge was thrown out, we are delighted," Cardiff City boss Neil Warnock told BBC Wales Sport.
"He got an extra game for the extra aggression when he came off, which he deserved."
Warnock says it is a positive to only lose defender Bamba for a further one match following the outcome a hearing into the defender's conduct.
"We will miss Bamba for the Brentford game. I thought it was a good hearing," he said.
"As far as I am concerned that is water under the bridge now. We have spoken, I can't see it happening again.
"I said to the commissioner, I was hoping he could show me more aggression. He's only been booked once this season, as a centre half."
Warnock says he wants four new recruits in the January transfer window, including a goalkeeper and a defender and says they are close to signing a striker.
"I've agreed to make one signing already, a young lad who I've been looking at over the last few months. I'm hoping from 1 January we'll be signing him, but that's not official yet," he said.
"It's difficult with it being Wales, if they're English you've got to get international clearance for them, then clearance from Wales. I just hope the people in those departments are Cardiff City fans."
Warnock has made clear he expects exits as well as arrivals in January and short-term signings Kieran Richardson and Marouane Chamakh are set to leave the club.
"I will speak to those two," Warnock continued.
"It is important I get the right balance. I am not 100% but I think both lads understand. They are two I could get off the wage bill, so chances are, I will be releasing them.
"I feel a bit sorry for Chamakh, but at the time when I came in, I felt we needed an influx of players. I wasn't aware of Emyr Huws or Declan John, as they were away with the Welsh squads.
"I didn't think we had cover for Rickie Lambert, but then I was impressed with Kenneth Zohore in training so brought him into the team.
"[Richardson and Chamakh] have been good professionals, but we need to manipulate this squad and those two are easy as their contracts are up. They will both find clubs."
