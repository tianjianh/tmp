Kenyan authorities have seized a cargo ship suspected to be carrying drugs at the port of Mombasa, police say.

The ship, with 205 containers on board, is now being searched, Mombasa Police Chief Francis Wanjohi told the BBC.
Elite Kenyan police units, including members of the narcotics squad, launched a surprise raid at midnight local time (21:00 GMT Thursday), sealing off all entrances to the port.
The main entrance to the port has now been reopened.
The berth holding the cargo ship, which had sailed from the Indian port of Mumbai, is still closed off.
Last month, Kenyan authorities blew up a yacht off the coast of Mombasa, after heroin worth $290,000 (Â£185,000) was found on board.
The UN Office on Drugs and Crime has on several occasions cited Kenya as a transit point for the re-packaging and trans-shipment of drugs to Europe and America.
