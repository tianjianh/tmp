The Toomebridge rider, who crashed out of the opener at the English circuit, lies seventh in the series and 66 points behind leader Shane Byrne.
Glenn Irwin retired in the first race and came in seventh in the second to leave him 14th in the standings.
Fellow Carrick man Alastair Seeley had a 14th-place finish before failing to complete race two.
Irwin's technical problem in race one led to Peter Hickman and Laverty taking a different line and both came off.
Andy Reid retired on lap 11 of the feature Supersport race after finishing sixth in the sprint race - he is third in the series.
Derriaghy's Carl Phillips was third in the Superstock 600 race with Keith Farmer fourth in the Superstock 1000 event.
Josh Elliott finished fifth in the Superstock 1000 race but was penalised 11 grid positions after a collision with Taylor Mackenzie.
The Fermanagh rider, demoted to 16th and out of the points, later apologised to Mackenzie.
