The Cookstown-based group has a strong specialism in hotel development.
It said it handed over "nine high-profile construction projects" during the time covered by its latest figures.
A note in its accounts said that it now has "minimal reliance" on bank funding for working capital and expects to have repaid all bank loans by September.
It has recently sold a portfolio of four Jurys hotels in England for a reported £80m.
The accounts stated that the group has bank loans of £17.5m, with funders including Ulster Bank and Cerberus, the US investment fund.
They added that "hugely positive progress" has been made with all funders.
The firm is currently working on a new office block for Belfast City Council and is also planning two major student accommodation schemes in the city.
It also recently won three major contracts in England, including a 380-bed Hub by Premier Inn hotel to be built at King's Cross in London.
