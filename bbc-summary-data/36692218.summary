Emma Follis struck the crossbar early on for the visitors only to see Harding give Liverpool the lead soon after.
Coombs was the provider with a neat flick-on in the area before she added the second within seven minutes.
Caroline Weir's pinpoint pass found her in space and allowed a finish on the half volley which doubled the lead.
Jade Boho-Sayo went close to pulling a goal back before the break for Reading, but her shot across goal was saved by Siobhan Chamberlain.
Reading improved in the second half as substitute Amber Stobbs saw Chamberlain tip her shot onto the post.
Liverpool climb to third and are now unbeaten in four games.
