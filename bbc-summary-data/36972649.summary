[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A march by the English Defence League - planned to end at a temporary beach - should be banned, a council has said.

Nottingham city councillor Dave Trimble said he had "major concerns about the risks it could pose to children and families in the city centre".
The march on Saturday would end at the city's Market Square where a temporary beach is located.
Police said the march could not be stopped but added officers were "constantly reviewing" the situation.

But Mr Trimble said: "Surely the safety of Nottingham citizens, particularly where young children are involved, has to come first?"
A video on the EDL website said the march was being organised to raise concerns about "Nottinghamshire residents involved in Islamic terror-related activities".
It also called for a program to "reduce the threat of Islamification in the UK".
Ch Supt Ian Howick, from Nottinghamshire Police, said the force had a legal obligation to keep the public safe and facilitate peaceful protests.
"Since being notified of the group's intentions, we have committed significant resources to ensure that we can meet both obligations and are taking all available steps to minimise the disruption caused to all those affected," he said.
"Having reviewed all available information, intelligence and human rights obligations, the specific conditions required to prevent a planned procession from taking place have not been met.
"However, the situation remains under constant review and, should this change, we have the necessary legislation in place to continue to keep Nottinghamshire safe."
