A&E under-resourced and over-stretched for winter, says doctor

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hospital emergency departments in Wales will be "under-resourced and over-stretched" this winter, a leading A&E doctor has told AMs.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But Dr Robin Roop from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine stressed that being stretched was probably now the norm for emergency departments.
Dr Roop said that there was a "lot of working going on" at local health boards to prepare for the winter.
He was addressing a health committee inquiry into winter preparedness.
"But our overall assessment - we think that emergency departments this winter are going to be very stretched and we don't think that [they'll be] fully prepared for the winter," Dr Roop said.
"But we just want to make an extension that we've been stretched, as today we're all stretched, and probably across the entire year we continue to be stretched."
"So winter, while it comes with different problems, I think we're still under-resourced and over-stretched for winter," he added.
