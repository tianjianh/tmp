The French-owned Chivas Brothers Ltd, part of Pernod Ricard, built the Â£25m Dalmunach facility on the site of a former distillery near Carron in Moray.
The distillery - named after a nearby pool in the River Spey - is capable of producing up to 10 million litres of spirit a year.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon performed the opening ceremony on Monday.
Laurent Lacassagne, chairman of Chivas Brothers, said the new facility would satisfy a growing demand.
The distillery has eight copper pot stills, with a tulip shape used for the wash stills and an onion shape used for the spirit stills, replicating those from the Imperial distillery which was situated on the site until 2012.
Mr Lacassagne said: "Dalmunach Distillery is an excellent example of securing the future of the industry by respecting its heritage and it's fitting that the remnants from the old Imperial Distillery have been built into an extremely efficient distillery with an architecturally stunning design."
Local Speyside companies were heavily involved in the distillery's construction.
Ms Sturgeon said: "Scotch Whisky is one of Scotland's iconic brands and is in huge demand all over the globe due to the exceptional quality the industry produces.
"It is hugely important to the Scottish economy and its protected EU status means it has an unmatched international reputation."
