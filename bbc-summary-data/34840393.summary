"Obviously the sending off kills us a bit but at half time you get in there and obviously want to galvanise and make sure we don't give anything away easily or quickly.
"We lost a couple of early goals and we folded after that. I thought we crumbled.
"I thought we were individuals who felt sorry for ourselves and it turned out an embarrassing scoreline."
