Gurpal Shehri, 28, who worked for Cambridgeshire Police, passed on information to the man who he had met at the Fitness Station gym in Dogsthorpe, Peterborough.
He was found guilty of misconduct in a public office at an earlier hearing.
Sentencing him, Judge John Plumstead said he had been a "spy in the camp".
The judge at St Albans Crown Court said: "This was treacherous behaviour towards the organisation you belonged to.
"The public is entitled to regard police officers and PCSOs as straight - those found not to be have to pay a high price."
Prosecutor Richard Barrington earlier told the jury of four men and eight women how Shehri jotted down notes from the Cambridgeshire police Camnet system.
"He gathered information in relation to a violent drug dealer and he passed on information that would no doubt have been valuable to him," said Mr Barrington.
"Providing police intelligence to a known drug dealer is a departure from the proper standards expected of a police officer."
Shehri, a married father of three, of Glinton Road, Milking Nook, Peterborough, denied misconduct in a public office between 1 April and 9 July 2013.
He told the court: "I genuinely didn't think I was doing anything wrong."
The jury found him guilty on a majority of 11 to one.
After the verdict was delivered, the prosecutor said Shehri had also pleaded guilty to fraud.
He had failed to declare a police caution when he applied to become a PCSO.
