Sussex Police said the woman, who was seen with the child at the station on Friday, was traced to her home address in London.
They said the girl was now in the care of social services but have not given any information about the mother.
Police began an urgent hunt for the woman after being alerted by members of the public who saw the child alone.
CCTV footage showed a woman, believed to be the child's mother, walking with the girl along Queens Road from the station, where they had arrived on a train from London at about 12:30 BST.
Minutes later, concerned passers-by alerted police after spotting the girl on her own at a bus stop near the Ibis Hotel, about 100m south of the station.
Sussex Police said the Metropolitan Police had now taken over the investigation, but a Scotland Yard spokesman was unable to give more details.
Detective Inspector Lee Horner, of Sussex Police, said on Friday that it was not clear whether the girl had got to the bus stop by herself or whether she lost her mother there.
