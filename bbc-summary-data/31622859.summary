[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Kent's youth police and crime commissioner will not be replaced when she finishes her 12-month stint in March, it has been revealed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kerry Boyd, 20, took a gap year from her education and business studies to take up the full-time role in 2014.
She stopped public engagements temporarily in June while reports of a relationship were investigated.
A spokeswoman for police and crime commissioner Ann Barnes said there were no plans to replace her at the moment.
Mrs Barnes was "still thinking about ways to engage with young people", she added.
In a blog post, Mrs Barnes said: "I hope that Kerry has enjoyed her time with us - there have been tough times, certainly, but 20-year-old Kerry has risen to the challenge and we shall miss her dry sense of humour and quick wit.
"She has been a great advocate for my office and given up numerous evenings and weekends as she has travelled far and wide to get the widest views possible."
The former London 2012 Olympic Torch-bearer from Margate was appointed to the post by Mrs Barnes in March, succeeding Paris Brown who resigned over comments she had posted on Twitter.
She was investigated in June after reports that she had a relationship with ex-county councillor and youth leader Robert Burgess, who is believed to have acted as a referee for the Â£15,000-a-year role.
Mr Burgess told BBC Radio Kent at the time that he and Miss Boyd had been "good friends".
The post, created by Mrs Barnes, is not compulsory and other counties do not have youth commissioners.
