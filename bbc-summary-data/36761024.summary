Many supporters - both at the Stade de France and back in Portugal - could not quite believe what they were seeing.
But it was a night of drama and bitter disappointment for the French.
A number of people were arrested, many during violence at the Fanzone near the Eiffel Tower.
Teargas was used as fans denied entry into the packed zone before the match pelted police with bottles.
More arrests were made for public order offences outside the Stade de France stadium.
Portuguese fans immediately took to social media sites after the final whistle to express their delight.
The triumph was especially sweet because Portuguese captain Cristiano Ronaldo - who was seen as the main threat by the French - was forced to leave the game after picking an injury in the first half.
A tweet below shows the raw emotions Ronaldo went through during the match - from tears on the stretcher to the joy of lifting the cup.
As the Eiffel Tower was lit in the Portuguese colours, Sirlei Elache tweeted:
"This is elegance! Congratulations France! Congratulations Portugal Champion"
In Lisbon, thousands of fans went wild after watching the game on giant screens at the city's Prace do Comercio.
"It's crazy. I'm going to party tonight."
Many fans, like Tiago Wakabayashi, said the victory ended 12 painful years for Portugal who, themselves the host nation in Euro 2004, unexpectedly lost in the final to Greece
But it was a heartbreaking night for millions of French fans - like thara#FRA - who saw their heroes beaten.
