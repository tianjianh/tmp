Captain Edward John Smith, who died when the ship went down, was born in Well Street in the town.
Professor Ray Johnson who has made documentary films about the Titanic, helped to unveil the plaque.
The Stoke-on-Trent-based producer said: "This street and this house links Hanley and Stoke-on-Trent with world history".
The unveiling follows a service on Saturday night at a statue of the captain in Lichfield, Staffordshire, to mark 100 years since the ship sank.
More than 1,500 candles were laid at the statue in Beacon Park. About 300 people, attended.
The short memorial service featured a tea-light candle for every person who died. A single violinist played as the candles were set down.
A flare was also released from the park, to represent the distress flares set off from the Titanic as disaster struck.
Mary Hutchinson, from the Lichfield Titanic Commemoration Group, said: "It speaks of all the attributes of being human.
"There was rightful pride from creating a state-of-the-art vessel with the patronage of some of the northern hemisphere's most wealthy and influential people.
"The captain was on his retirement journey, the whole thing was completely state-of-the-art 100 years ago and then faced such appalling tragedy on so many fronts."
