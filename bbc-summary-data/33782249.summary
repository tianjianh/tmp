[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A professor has said there is "no risk of any donor affecting results" after it emerged a project tracking Cecil the lion was funded by a pro-hunting group.

Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit was researching lions including Cecil, which was shot dead in Zimbabwe.
Dallas Safari Club which "absolutely" supports sustainable trophy hunting but "abhors poaching", donated $20,000.
Prof David Macdonald said: "We simply do our work."
"There is no risk of any donor affecting our results - we report our results regardless of whether they state any particular point of view or not."
Cecil was a well-known tourist attraction in Zimbabwe and was shot by dentist Walter Palmer from Minnesota, USA.
Chris Macsween, a trustee of the conservation charity LionAid, said it was "unfortunate" that organisations allowed pro-hunters to sponsor their research.
He said: "This is equivalent to a tobacco company accepting research from their stable of scientists to say that smoking is not damaging to health."
A spokeswoman for Dallas Safari Club said it "absolutely" supports sustainable trophy hunting, but did not provide further comment.
In a statement on its website following Cecil's death it said: "Lawful, ethical, vigilant hunters play an important role in public acceptance of sustainable hunting as a vital tool for modern wildlife conservation and management."
Donations for Cecil reached more than Â£550,000 and more funding was pledged by Ty Warner who founded Beanie Babies.
Profits from the sales of a Cecil Beanie Baby will go to WildCRU.
Prof Macdonald said: "We will devote ourselves, supported by the incredible generosity of these donations, to working for the conservation of lions in Hwange and, with this marvellous support, the surrounding landscapes in adjoining countries."
Cecil's death sparked outrage across the world.
Zimbabwe is seeking the extradition of Mr Palmer.
