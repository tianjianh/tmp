Teaching and support staff at London Metropolitan University are staging a one-day strike over job cuts.

Members of Unison and the University and College Union (UCU), are angry at university plans to axe 165 academic and support posts.
London Met says it needs to reduce costs after student numbers fell for the second consecutive year.
The university must reassess its plans or face a "spiral of decline", said Unison branch secretary Max Watson.
The walkout follows a strike last month by UCU members.
Members of both unions are picketing university buildings.
A university spokesman said it had put contingency plans in place to ensure minimal disruption to front-line services.
The job cuts followed a report last year "to review the size and shape of London Met, which showed that our cost structure is too large for a university of our size", said the spokesman.
"We therefore need to reduce our cost structure to be more in line with our student numbers, as well as universities in the capital similar to London Met.
"We have engaged fully with our staff unions to try to avoid the need for compulsory redundancies."
The two unions say strike action is a last resort and urge the university to reassess its plans and reopen negotiations.
"We have heard from the same senior management time and time again that their proposed cuts are essential to the survival of the university," said Mr Watson.
"As a result of this failed strategy, we are witnessing a spiral of decline - one that will continue if the university goes ahead with yet more job cuts."
UCU regional official Barry Jones said: "It is disappointing that the university is still refusing to budge over these proposed cuts.
"Instead of cutting back on jobs, the university should be building on its reputation for expanding access to education."
UCU fears the cuts will risk London Metropolitan's reputation for providing educational opportunities for disadvantaged groups.
Figures for 2012-13 suggest 52% of full-time undergraduate entrants were mature students, compared with 23% nationally, while 51% were from disadvantaged backgrounds, compared with 33% nationally, says the union.
