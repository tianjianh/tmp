The Championship club have the option to make the move a permanent one at the end of the 2016-17 season.
Germany Under-21 international Kachunga, 24, was Ingolstadt's record signing when he joined in 2015, but made only three starts last term.
"Sometimes you need a hard experience as a young player to make steps forward," said head coach David Wagner.
The Terriers boss told the club website: "I'm sure with his pace, mobility and working attitude he gives another great option up front, which we needed for the upcoming season.
"It was a big target of ours in this summer window to bring in senior competition for Nahki Wells and I believe that is what Elias will give."
