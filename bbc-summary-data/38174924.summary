Jaime Cheesman was 16 when she disappeared in November 1993 after moving from Wellingborough to Grimsby.
Police said the latest sighting of her was in November 2015 in Northumberland.
Her father, Eric, said: "I still haven't got a clue what's happened to Jaime but I'll never give up hope."
He added: "I just keep thinking that she's going to turn up one of these days.
"I believe that somebody knows where she is. There's the possibility that she might still be in this area but there's no telling at the moment."
Det Sgt Sam Cunnington from Humberside Police said: "There are a number of inquiries being pursued in relation to Jaime's disappearance."
In response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, Humberside Police said the sightings were in Northampton and Milton Keynes in 1994, at a Northampton nightclub in 2000 and in Wellingborough in 2004.
A "similar-looking lady" was spotted in Alnwick, Northumberland, in November 2015.
Ms Cheesman's home in Comber Place, Grimbsy, was forensically examined in March 2016.
Police said nothing was found that assisted their investigation.
Ms Cheesman, who would now be 39, was last seen in November 1993 in the Comber Place area of Grimsby where she lived with the family of her best friend.
Her family said she often travelled between there and her home town Wellingborough.
Police said she is thought to have left the house in Grimsby following a disagreement shortly before she disappeared.
