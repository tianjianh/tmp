Rugby World Cup 2015: Fotuali'i leads Samoa against Scotland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Saints' Kahn Fotuali'i will captain a Samoa side showing seven changes for their final Rugby World Cup game against Scotland in Newcastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The scrum-half takes over with London Irish back-row Ofisa Treviranus not included in the match-day squad.
Fotuali'i is one of seven British-based players named by Samoa head coach Stephen Betham in his starting XV.
Betham has ensured that all but one of his squad will have had a taste of World Cup finals action.
Should fly-half Patrick Fa'apale come off the bench, only prop Jake Grey will not have played at the finals.
Scotland will secure a place in the quarter-finals with a victory, but Samoa cannot qualify.
Centres Rey Lee-Lo, of Cardiff Blues, and George Pisi, of Northampton, combine for the first time for Samoa.
And Betham names a new back-row combination of Bath duo Maurie Fa'asavalu and Alafoti Fa'osiliva, plus Bristol's Jack Lam.
Fa'atoina Autagavaia, the former Northampton wing now with French club Nevers, replaces Alesana Tuilagi, the Newcastle Falcons player who is suspended for foul play in the weekend defeat by Japan.
Aurillac hooker Manu Leiataua, who made his debut for Samoa in their only ever win over Scotland - 27-17 during the 2013 Quadrangular Tournament in South Africa - will make his first World Cup appearance.
Northampton wing Ken Pisi drops to the bench, while Sale Sharks centre Johnny Leota, Waikato hooker Ole Avei, and flankers Josh Ione and Faifili Levave drop out the squad.
