Fines for dog fouling in Scotland to double to £80

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fines for dog owners who fail to pick up after their pets are set to double.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fixed penalty for dog fouling currently stands at £40 but from 1 April it will be raised to £80.
The measure was said to be supported by 63% of people asked in a YouGov poll by Keep Scotland Beautiful.
Community safety minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "We believe the increased penalty will act as a greater deterrent for people who do not take responsibility for their pets."
The Scottish government said it was also working with councils to consider how more unpaid penalties could be collected.
Mr Wheelhouse added: "Dog fouling is not only unpleasant, it can also pose potentially significant risks to health, particularly to children.
"We are clear that dog owners who do not clear up after their pets are breaking the law.
Derek Robertson, the chief executive of Keep Scotland Beautiful, said the increased fine sent a "clear message" to dog owners.
He added: "However, increased fines form only part of the solution and that is why we have called for national leadership and a more strategic integrated and coordinated approach to conserve and improve Scotland's local environmental quality."
The new penalties carry exemptions for blind people in charge of their guide dog and disabled people with physical impairments which affect their ability to lift or carry everyday objects.
