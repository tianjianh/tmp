Music fans going to Glastonbury Festival have been warned by organisers that security checks will be stepped up in light of the terror attacks.

The festival website is also advising people to arrive on Thursday or Friday when queues are expected to be shorter.
"As a general rule, we would ask you to only bring as much as you can carry yourself," it said ahead of the festival, where gates open on 21 June.
Car park entertainment and facilities for early arrivals are also shelved.
Normally, the organisers put on entertainment for people who arrive early, from 21:00 BST on Tuesday prior to the festival gates being opened on the Wednesday at 08:00 BST.
Organisers have now warned that those who arrive before the gates open will "be expected to remain in their cars".
The website statement added: "For security reasons, all ticket holders will be subject to extra searches of their vehicles, their bags and their person at this year's Festival.
"This will make entrance slower than in previous years."
Organisers have also asked people to put luggage tags on all their bags, with their names and mobile numbers and to avoid wrapping their belongings in thick plastic wrap as they need to be removed for checks.
Separate lanes are also being introduced for people with large luggage and trolleys.
Some 175,000 will be attending the music event at Worthy Farm in Pilton, which runs until Sunday June 25.
