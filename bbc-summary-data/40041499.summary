Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale and Aston Villa defender Neil Taylor are suspended for the game in Belgrade and have not been included in Coleman's squad.
MK Dons defender Joe Walsh, Wolves midfielder Lee Evans and Liverpool forward Ben Woodburn are other uncapped players in the squad.
Woodburn is joined in the squad by Liverpool team-mate Harry Wilson, Wales' youngest ever international player.
Ampadu made his professional debut in August 2016 and was named Wales' young player of the year in November,
He was on a standby list for Wales' World Cup qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in March.
Defender Jones spent the second half of the 2016-17 season on loan at Championship side Barnsley, where he made 17 appearances.
