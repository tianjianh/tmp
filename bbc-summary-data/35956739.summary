Rowe finished 48 seconds behind winner Peter Sagan and secured Team Sky's best ever result at what is one of cycling's five 'monuments.'
The 26-year-old is hoping he is getting closer to securing a first ever podium.
"I'm getting there slowly but surely so hopefully in a few years it can all come together nicely," he said.
"It's my biggest result to date.
"Before today I would have said eighth place in Paris-Roubaix last year was my biggest result.
"Paris-Roubaix and Flanders are both on the same level so I'm a couple of places higher and a couple of places nearer the podium and the top steps."
Team-mate and fellow Welshman Geraint Thomas finished 12th after an early crash.
