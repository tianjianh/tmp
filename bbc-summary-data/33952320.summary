Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly has captured timelapse footage of the spectacular sight, from the International Space Station.
The splashes of colour are caused by the interaction of charged particles and the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere.
Scott took the sunrise footage on his 141st day of his #yearinspace mission.
