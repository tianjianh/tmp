[SN]TITLE[SN]
England 21-24 New Zealand

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England fell to a fourth consecutive defeat for the first time in eight years as New Zealand snuffed out their early threat with a ruthless second-half display.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jonny May's brilliant try had given Stuart Lancaster's raw side the perfect start, and two Owen Farrell penalties had opened up a three-point lead at the interval.
But second-half tries from captain Richie McCaw and replacement Charlie Faumuina were a fitting reward for a dominant display from a dominant All Blacks team.

A late penalty try narrowed the gap to three points with 30 seconds left but England, who could offer only minimal attacking threat as the game wore on, were grateful for a series of missed kicks from the visitors' fly-halves.
England had fewer than half as many caps in their squad as the world champions and that gulf in experience and nous proved critical as conditions worsened.
May's debut international try lit up the stadium like a November firework as he fizzed through a narrow gap down the left and then skinned full-back Israel Dagg on the outside.
He then almost had a second after gathering Farrell's kick ahead but was scragged by the last defender, and England went close again as Billy Vunipola charged to within a few inches and then Mike Brown spilled a pass on the right wing with the try line open.
New Zealand had barely touched the ball in those first 10 minutes but on their first incursion into England's half they struck back.
Jerome Kaino slipped between two weak tackles on the left before Aaron Cruden burrowed for the line, and if replays suggested he may have been marginally short, referee Nigel Owens gave the try without recourse to the television match official.
England kept coming. New Zealand's under-pressure forwards infringed at the breakdown and Farrell landed a brace of penalties for 11-5, only for the All Blacks to capitalise on a prolonged period of threatening territory with two straightforward penalties from Cruden's right boot.
Farrell's third penalty on half-time edged England back in front, but within a few minutes of the re-start the lead was gone.
Owen Franks punched a hole up the middle, the ball was spread left with the defence right and Dagg fed captain McCaw for his 25th All Blacks try.
Cruden's conversion attempt was horrible but England were struggling for any control. Sam Whitelock almost stole another try as England dallied in a ruck on their own line after Eastmond's kick was charged down.
Lancaster sent on Ben Morgan and Matt Mullan to add ballast to the fortifications, and when Dane Coles was sin-binned with 23 minutes remaining for kicking out at a ruck and the deficit just two points, fresh hope blossomed in torrential autumnal rain.
Yet England could not get their hands on the ball. Julian Savea spilled the ball when charging for the line and although replacement fly-half Beauden Barrett made a mess of a simple penalty he clipped over another for 14-19.
Faumuina went over from close range to make it 14-24, and that late penalty try was barely even consolation for a crowd frustrated by both Owens' decisions and New Zealand's fifth win over England in 12 months.
