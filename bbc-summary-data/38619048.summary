Sam Morsy fired the hosts into a first-half lead with an effort from 20 yards out moments after he had struck a post.
Their lead was doubled within minutes when a Will Grigg effort was saved by Dan Bentley only for Brentford defender Harlee Dean to deflect in the rebound.
Brentford claimed a late consolation when Jota bundled in from close range.
Wigan climb to 21st and above fellow strugglers Burton Albion on goal difference, who they beat 2-0 away last Saturday.
Brentford remain 15th but have lost back-to-back Championship matches and three of their past five league games.
They were without striker and leading scorer Scott Hogan for the trip to the DW Stadium, who is understood to be close to joining Premier League side West Ham.
Aside from substitute Jota's late goal, Andreas Bjelland came closest to scoring for the Bees when his header from a corner was brilliantly tipped over the crossbar by Wigan goalkeeper Jakob Haugaard.
Wigan manager Warren Joyce told BBC Radio Manchester: "We've just got to take one game at a time and keep trying to do the right things and make sure that we're doing the right things in training next week.
"I thought there were a lot of good performances today. To a man, everybody contributed well and it was a really good team effort.
"Jakob Haugaard made a great save in the second half and he'll be disappointed to concede late when the ball was bouncing around the area."
Brentford boss Dean Smith told BBC Radio London: "It's very frustrating. We've picked exactly the same side which played so very well against Newcastle last week and then today, it's a 'Jekyll and Hyde' performance.
"I felt we got out-battled today and that's the disappointing part of it. We're a good footballing team, but teams aren't going to let us play all the time.
"Wigan did a job on us and got in our faces, stopped us playing and the surface isn't great here. We didn't pass it as well as we can and caused ourselves problems.
"That's very unlike us, I don't think we've put in a performance like that in a long while."
