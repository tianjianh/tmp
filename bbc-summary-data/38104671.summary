Jermaine Baker shooting: Armed officer could face charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Met Police firearms officer could face prosecution over the shooting of a man who was killed during a botched attempt to free a prisoner.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jermaine Baker, 28, from Tottenham, was killed by armed officers last December.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said there was "an indication a criminal offence may have been committed".
It is to refer the case to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether charges should be brought.
Mr Baker and two other men were waiting in a car to try to free a prisoner who was being taken to Wood Green Crown Court.
IPCC commissioner Cindy Butts said it had gathered evidence relating to the actions of the firearms officer who shot Mr Baker.
Last month the senior police officer involved in the operation was allowed to retire, despite being under investigation.
A legal bid by Mr Baker's family to stop the policeman- known as "officer FE16" - retiring failed after a High Court judge ruled he was free to leave the force.
Mr Baker's mother Margaret Smith has vowed to continue her "fight for justice".
In a statement issued by their solicitor, Mr Baker's family said: "We have very serious concerns about the circumstances in which Jermaine was shot.
"Our priority is to find out the truth and have anyone responsible for his death held to account.
"We look to the CPS to ensure that justice is done."
