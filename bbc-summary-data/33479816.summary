Stowaway gecko brought to Swansea from Spain in suitcase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second gecko in two weeks has accidentally been brought back to Swansea from a holiday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The small lizard was found in a suitcase after a trip to Spain and taken to Llys Nini Animal Centre.
The RSPCA said it was most likely a Moorish gecko, also known as a common wall gecko, which can grow up to 15cm (6in).
Last month a couple from Swansea found a tiny gecko in their luggage after returning from the Caribbean.
