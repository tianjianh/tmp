Denning - one of the original line-up of Radio 1 DJs in 1967 - has been charged with six sexual offences against four boys during the 1960s and 1970s.
He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 14 July.
Surrey Police said the charges relate to Operation Ravine.
A Surrey Police spokesman said: "The charges relate to the wider investigation into non-recent sexual offences connected to the Walton Hop Disco."
Former music industry figure Jonathan King, from Bayswater, West London, has been questioned as part of Operation Ravine and is on bail until October 13.
Surrey Police is also investigating an 86-year-old man from Walton-on-Thames as part of the inquiry.
The force said it has also been notified of the death of a man in his 70s who was due to answer bail in connection with the investigation.
