Ipswich defender Luke Hyam has said he is "distraught" after his tackle led to Brentford's Alan Judge suffering a lower leg fracture.

Judge, 27, who made his Republic of Ireland debut in March, looks set to miss his country's Euro 2016 campaign.
Hyam was booked for the second-minute tackle and later sent off for a second yellow card in first-half injury time.
"I'd like to contact him in a day or so and give him my best and say how sorry I am," Hyam told Town's club website.
"I feel distraught over it. It was distressing to see and definitely affected me. My head had gone.
"I know the Brentford lads were getting into me but I should never have reacted the way I did to get sent off.
"I've been out injured for a year myself and the last thing I want to see is a fellow pro getting injured like that."
Judge - who joined Brentford in 2014 - has scored 14 goals in all competitions for the club so far this season and posted a picture from his hospital bed on Twitter on Sunday.
"This is football, things like this happen," said Judge. "I will be back stronger and much better than I have been before. I will achieve my dream one way or the other - nothing will hold me back."
A Brentford statement read: "Alan has now been transferred to a London hospital where he will be managed by the leading lower limb consultant in the country.
"The nature of his management and long-term prognosis cannot be speculated on at this time. However, it should be stated that a full recovery is not in question."
Brentford went on to win Saturday's game 3-1, their first ever victory at Portman Road and first over Ipswich since 1955.
