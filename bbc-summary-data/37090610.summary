Germany beat USA 2-1 earlier on Monday to also reach the semi-finals, and will face the Netherlands.
The Dutch survived a late fightback to overcome Argentina 3-2.
Kate Richardson-Walsh, Great Britain captain:
"Our form reminds me of the Olympic qualifiers in Valencia. We built momentum game to game and we went unbeaten at that tournament. It feels the same as that.
"We don't expect to win. We believe. We go back to square one for the next game. We believe we can win but we must do our jobs. We have to execute the tactics laid out by the coaches but we believe in what we're doing."
"We can't go into the New Zealand game thinking emotionally. We believe we can get a medal but it's off in the distance and we are focused on the semi-final."
