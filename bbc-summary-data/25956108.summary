The Blues had 39 efforts on goal, while the visitors only managed one, having spent most of the match defending.
"This is not the best league in the world, this is football from the 19th Century," said Mourinho.
"The only [other] thing I could bring was a Black and Decker [tool] to destroy the wall."
Despite the numerous attempts, the Blues managed only nine on target. Hammers keeper Adrian made three good saves from John Terry, Samuel Eto'o and Frank Lampard.

Brazil midfielder Oscar and substitute striker Demba Ba were also denied by the woodwork.
West Ham's only effort on goal was when James Tomkins's header was comfortably dealt with by Petr Cech. They should have made the Blues keeper work again moments later, but Andy Carroll failed to connect with Stewart Downing's delivery from eight yards out.
"It's very difficult to play a football match where only one team wants to play. It's very difficult," added Mourinho, whose side are now three points behind league leaders Manchester City after they won 5-1 at Tottenham.
"A football match is about two teams playing and this match was only one team playing and another team not playing.
"I told Big Sam [West Ham manager Allardyce] and I repeat my words: they need points and, because they need points, to come here and play the way they did, is it acceptable? Maybe, yes.
"I cannot be too critical, because if I was in his position I don't know if I would do the same. Maybe."

Allardyce, whose side remain in the bottom three but recorded only their second clean sheet in 11 matches, hit back at Mourinho's comments.
"He can't take it, can he? He can't take it because we've outwitted him - he just can't cope," said the Hammers boss.
"He can tell me all he wants, I don't care.
"I love to see Chelsea players moaning at the referee, trying to intimidate him, Jose jumping up and down saying we play rubbish football.
"It's brilliant when you get a result against him. Hard luck, Jose."
Allardyce also praised his team's defensive performance, with his team having conceded 17 goals in their previous five fixtures going into Wednesday's match.
"Tactically we got it right in two areas particularly: one was in stopping [Eden] Hazard, Oscar and Willian and [Samuel] Eto'o scoring goals; and the other one was stopping them scoring from set plays. We did a fantastic job."
