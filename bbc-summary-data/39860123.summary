Abu Hassan, 18, is believed to be the first Jordanian player to sign a professional contract with a UK club.
He began his career with Jordan Youth Club and has since made 11 appearances for his country's under-19 side.
"I am delighted that Ghassan will be joining us for the start of pre-season training," Rovers' under-23 coach Chris Hargreaves told the club website.
Bristol Rovers are owned by the Jordanian Al-Qadi family, who bought a 92% stake in the club in February 2016.
Club president and Jordanian Football Association member Wael Al-Qadi brokered the move, which is subject to international clearance.
The Pirates finished 10th in League One this season following consecutive promotions from the National League and League Two.
