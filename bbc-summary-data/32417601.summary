Eyemouth's former Fishermen's Mission becomes arts centre

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former fishermen's mission in the Scottish Borders is being converted into an arts and performance centre.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After 25 years, the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen closed its doors in Eyemouth in 2012.
Now the former granary building is being turned into an arts centre, run by a community interest company.
Once the ground floor alterations are complete, it is hoped the venue - the brainchild of artist Paula Tod, and her husband Ian - will open in June.
The first theatre performance - A Cinema in South Georgia - will tell the story of Eyemouth's whaling pioneers in the South Atlantic.
The Hippodrome will also contain a cafe selling local whole foods and was last week granted an alcohol licence.
All of the programme details should soon be available on a website and Facebook.
