Fisher, who has represented England at Saxons level, joined Saints in 2014 and made 25 appearances for the club.
Fisher previously played for London Irish but missed most of the 2013-14 campaign with a serious injury..
"Jon is an experienced Premiership performer and has the right characteristics to fit in well," director of rugby Andy Robinson said.
"He's a young man whose versatility provides us with plenty of options. Jon is highly regarded by those who have coached him and we're looking forward to welcoming him to Bristol."
Fisher added: "I'm pleased to be joining Bristol at such an exciting time for the club."
Bristol returned to the top flight for the first time since 2009 with a 60-47 aggregate victory over Doncaster in May's Championship play-off final.
