Wanda Campbell loses appeal against garage fraud sentence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A woman who was jailed for three years for conning a south of Scotland garage firm out of £110,000 has lost an appeal against her sentence.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wanda Campbell, 43, of Auchenmalg near Newton Stewart, was convicted at Dumfries Sheriff Court last November.
She was found guilty of acting with others to take the money from James Haugh Castle Douglas between March 2012 and October 2013.
She was jailed and ordered to pay compensation of £110,000.
Campbell's appeal was heard by Lord Brodie and Lord Drummond Young at the High Court in Edinburgh.
Her trial had been told that the money had been transferred to Campbell to be kept safe and used as cash flow for the business.
However, she started spending the money as soon as she received it.
The business went into liquidation the day before her trial started in September 2016.
