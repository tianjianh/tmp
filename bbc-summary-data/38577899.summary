European Challenge Cup: Benetton Treviso 0-41 Gloucester Rugby

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gloucester thrashed Treviso in Italy after their European Challenge Cup match was switched to the training ground because of a frozen surface.

The match kicked off two hours late at 16:00 GMT after referee Thomas Charabas deemed the Stadio Monigo pitch unplayable.
James Hook and Richard Hibbard crossed in the first half, before Matt Scott, Hibbard, David Halaifonua and Billy Twelvetrees sealed a bonus-point win.
Gloucester now top Pool One.
European Professional Club Rugby rules state that a venue had to be found within 24 hours to play the game, but with temperatures set to drop even further, the decision was made by club officials to play at Treviso's La Ghirada training ground.
Gloucester's large contingent of travelling fans embraced the last-minute change of venue, and were helped to the new location by home supporters.
Despite the fading light, freezing conditions and basic floodlights, Gloucester put on a fine performance for the supporters who had travelled the 4km from Stadio Monigo.
The Cherry and Whites pack was far too strong for the Italian outfit and in-form Wales hooker Hibbard went over twice from the maul as Gloucester ran in six tries.
Gloucester will host Bayonne at Kingsholm next Saturday in their final pool match.
