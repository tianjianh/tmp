[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build 1,200 homes on the site of Deepcut Barracks in Surrey have gone on display.

The Army is due to leave the barracks in 2013, when training facilities will be moved elsewhere.
The exhibition is being held by Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) as part of public consultation, Surrey Heath council said.
Proposals for the 117-hectare site include housing, open space, access roads, a primary school and some shops.
Opponents of the plan have questioned whether the infrastructure is adequate to cope with an influx of hundreds of new residents.
Surrey Heath council said this consultation was being carried out by DIO, which is responsible for Ministry of Defence (MoD) property, but the local authority would run its own consultation after a formal planning application was submitted.
The site is being released by the MoD following a national review of training that was prompted by the deaths of four soldiers in unclear circumstances at the Surrey army base.
Privates Sean Benton, Cheryl James, Geoff Gray and James Collinson all died from gunshot wounds between 1995 and 2002.
A coroner recorded a verdict of suicide for Pte Benton, but the inquests into the other three returned open verdicts.
The exhibition was taking place on Wednesday at Deepcut Village Hall.
