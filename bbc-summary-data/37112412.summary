Nottingham's Pizza Factory said it had lost a contract to a competitor and had started "formal consultations" with its staff.
Unite, the union, said it understood the supermarket was Tesco and between 300 and 350 staff were affected.
The Pizza Factory is part of the multi-million pound food company 2 Sisters and employs 1,150 people in Nottingham.
The company said it would be wrong to say exactly how many people were affected this early in the process and it was just one part of the business.
A spokesman said: "Our immediate priority will be to mitigate this loss and explore other opportunities to gain new business.
"However, this does mean we will need to start formal consultations with colleagues and their representatives."
Unite regional officer Andy Shaw said talks would be held with management on Friday.
"This is very bad news for the workers and their families, and a hammer blow for the wider Nottingham economy," he said.
"It is early days and details about the scale of the job losses remain unclear, as does a timeframe for any redundancies."
Food giant 2 Sisters employs 23,000 people in four countries and makes Goodfella's pizzas and Fox's biscuits.
According to its website, Tesco is The Pizza Factory's largest customer.
