Paul Trollope is "confident" Cardiff City can turn the pressure they are under into a "positive" when they host Leeds United.

The head coach laughed off the suggestion he himself is under pressure after Cardiff conceded six goals in their two latest Championship defeats.
But like all their rivals he admits Cardiff are under pressure.
"We need to turn that pressure into a positive feeling and a positive thing," he said.
Trollope says no-one is more frustrated and disappointed than himself following the 3-2 defeat at Norwich last Saturday and Tuesday's 3-0 loss at Preston.
After events at Preston, Trollope apologised to the Bluebirds' travelling fans.
Ahead of Saturday's chance for redemption against Leeds, he said: "I think every manager in the Championship is under pressure, whether you're in the top two, in the bottom three or in the middle of the league.
"There's probably four or five Championship teams in the bottom half with greater expectations, ourselves being one of them.
"You have to look at yourself and get your own house in order and that's our focus.
"We've got some business to put right after a disappointing couple of weeks so that's our focus, making sure we're fresh, we play with a big hunger a big desire and we're tactically ready as well."
Former Swansea City manager Garry Monk returns to south Wales for the first time since his departure from the the Premier League club.
Trollope says Monk's historic links with Cardiff's arch rivals could enhance the traditional rivalry between the Bluebirds and Leeds.
"He's well known in south Wales and hopefully he won't be enjoying his trip back this time," said Trollope.
"I'm fully aware the rivalry between the clubs, if adds a bit of spice then bring it on."
Defender Joe Bennett, who joined on a three-year deal from Aston Villa in August, is not expected to return to full training until next week.
