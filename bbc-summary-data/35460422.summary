RAF 'Vision loss' pilot in guided landing in North Yorkshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An RAF pilot was guided into landing his jet by a colleague in another aircraft after suffering "a partial loss of vision", it has emerged.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The pilot was flying solo during a training flight on Thursday and radioed for assistance while returning to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire.
The Hawk jet was promptly joined by another aircraft from the same squadron as a wingman to provide guidance.
They then flew in formation and landed safely.
The RAF has offered no further details on the condition of the pilot.
A spokesman said: "Flying in formation, and conducting an approach to land as a formation, is a daily skill practised by RAF fast jet pilots."
