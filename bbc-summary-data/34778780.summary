He pulled out of England's ongoing series with New Zealand because of the posterior cruciate ligament injury.
Tomkins, 26, is re-joining Wigan next season after a two-year stint at NRL side New Zealand Warriors.
Chairman Ian Lenegan told the club website that it was decided he needed surgery after consultation with a specialist.
"The surgery was performed successfully on Friday and it is anticipated that Sam will make a full recovery," said Lenegan.
Super League 2016 will begin on 4 February, with Wigan starting their campaign the following day at home to Catalans Dragons.
