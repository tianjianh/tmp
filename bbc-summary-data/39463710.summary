Colchester United 4-0 Stevenage

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A superb first-half display secured Colchester a thumping 4-0 victory over fellow League Two play-off hopefuls Stevenage.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Brindley hit the woodwork early on for Colchester, who took an 11th-minute lead when Brennan Dickenson lashed home after Drey Wright had helped on Tarique Fosu's delivery into the box.
Keeper Sam Walker made a fine double stop at his near post to deny Stevenage forward Matt Godden but Colchester doubled their lead just before the half-hour through Chris Porter's deflected shot after Sean Murray had followed up when George Elokobi's header hit a post.
It was 3-0 in the 33rd minute when Stevenage's Josh McQuoid turned into his own net after Tom Eastman had helped on a corner.
And Fosu's cross was headed into his own net by Charlie Lee seven minutes before half-time for Colchester's fourth.
Walker pushed Jobi McAnuff's curled effort over early in the second half for Stevenage, for whom Jack King stabbed just wide.
Boro goalkeeper Chris Day denied Dickenson late on but Colchester's win had long since been assured.
