Aston Villa have signed Manchester City right-back Micah Richards on a free transfer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 26-year-old, who has 13 England caps, has agreed a four-year deal and will move to Villa Park on 1 July after his contract with City expires.
Richards was a key member of City's Premier League-winning side of 2011-12 but found his chances limited under manager Manuel Pellegrini.
He spent last season on loan with Serie A side Fiorentina.
Richards is Villa's first signing of the summer, delighting manager Tim Sherwood, who said: "I'm sure he will prove to be an excellent signing for the football club."
He joined City as a 14-year-old from Oldham and made his Premier League debut in October 2005.
A year later aged 18, he became the youngest defender ever to be called up to the England squad.
Richards made almost 250 appearances for City. He won the FA Cup with the Blues in 2011 and a second Premier League title in 2013-14, although he only made two league appearances in that season.
