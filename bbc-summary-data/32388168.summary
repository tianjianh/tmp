Frank Knight, 67, published an apology to Owen Oyston and his son Karl after posting allegations concerning them and the club on his Facebook page.
But football fans responded by raising £20,915 on a crowd-funding website.
The Frank Knight campaign is keeping the appeal open to help other fans sued by the club.
Fans of clubs ranging from Liverpool to Middlesbrough and non-league teams such as FC United and Stockport County contributed to the fund.
The appeal was even backed by tweets from Countdown presenter Rachel Riley and comedian Russell Brand.
Mr Knight said on his Facebook page: "I cannot comment upon the legal complaint for legal reasons, however I would just like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Joe Atherton [Blackpool fan who set up the webpage] and to everyone for their messages of support and donations. I am truly humbled."
Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston is being investigated by the Football Association over abusive texts sent to a Blackpool supporter.
The Oyston family is also seeking £150,000 damages for allegedly defamatory comments on the Back Henry Street website.
In February Tim Fielding, a director of a personal injuries law firm and the former chair of the Blackpool Supporters' Trust apologised for comments he had made.
Earlier that month, dozens of Blackpool fans attended a court hearing in Manchester  for a separate legal action brought by the Oystons against a fan.
David Ragozzino, 32, was given 21 days to respond to a claim for damages from the club. He is due to meet with the club next week.
On 30 January another fan, Stephen Sharpe, apologised to the Oystons over his online comments, withdrawing his posts after accepting they were "false, defamatory and, in some cases, threatening".
Blackpool supporters have been involved in demonstrations, match boycotts and social media campaigns over the way Oyston family run the club.
