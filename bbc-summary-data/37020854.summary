[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Organisers of the annual festival in Scotland's national book town have promised their "largest ever" programme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Wigtown will host about 280 events between 23 September and 2 October.
Among the speakers this year are politician Sir Malcolm Rifkind, TV presenter Janet Ellis and journalist Sian Williams.
Director Adrian Turpin said they tried to do things a little bit differently every year.
"It is the largest festival we have ever run - there are about 280 events this year," he said.
"At the centre of it all this year one of the things we are going to be looking at is the subject of islands."
Mr Turpin said that theme would cover Scottish islands but also the implications of Brexit.
As well as a wide programme of talks other events are planned throughout the 10-day festival.
They include a creative writing class, discussion of the future of public libraries and a class on "street wisdom".
