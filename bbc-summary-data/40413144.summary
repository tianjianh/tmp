Only 30 overs were bowled because of rain on day two at Headingley.
But Sangakkara scored 91 of the 122 runs scored in a delayed first hour of play as Surrey raced from their overnight 374-6 to 516-7 declared.
Yorkshire reached 27-1 in 10.5 overs before the rain returned.
The hosts lost opener Adam Lyth, leg before to Sam Curran, in the eighth over of their reply, while England Test captain Joe Root ended the day unbeaten on 12.
The day-night match is one of nine being played this week to trial floodlit championship cricket featuring a pink ball.
Sri Lanka great Sangakkara, 39, reached his century off 136 balls and his 150 off only another 28, hitting 21 fours and four sixes in total.
He shared a 158-run stand for the seventh wicket with new England T20 international Tom Curran (44) to ensure maximum batting bonus points.
His 1,000th championship run of 2017, making him the first to achieve that feat in English cricket this summer, came with a four off Tim Bresnan.
Sangakkara, who played 134 Tests for Sri Lanka between 2000 and 2015, scored the 100th century of his career this month.
Yorkshire assistant coach Rich Pyrah told BBC Radio Leeds:
"Kumar obviously played really well, but I didn't think we hit our lengths as consistently as we can. It's a little bit frustrating.
"We know how important the new ball is with the pink one before it gets soft. We were inconsistent and let him get away again.
"But he's a class player. When he's playing like that at the end, it's very difficult to stop him scoring."
Surrey's Tom Curran told BBC Radio London:
"It was another masterclass from the great man. He's been unbelievable. His record speaks for itself. There's not much more we can say about him - it's all been said.
"He's a great player and a great man, and I was honoured to be out there watching him do his thing. It was a great experience for me. He makes it look a lot easier than I do.
"I find the pink ball all right. Jason Roy said yesterday that it doesn't sound as nice off the bat, but it still seems to go.
"Sam bowled beautifully, and we could have had a few more wickets between us.
"It was a huge honour to represent England for the first time and it has been a special few days. I've loved every second of it. But it's nice to be back with the Surrey boys."
