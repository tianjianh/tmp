Hearts consider safe standing section after studying Celtic Park experience

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts are considering the introduction of a safe standing section at Tynecastle.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A delegation from the club's operations team spent time analysing Celtic's standing section ahead of Sunday's final league match at Celtic Park.
It is thought the standing section at Tynecastle could be introduced in the stadium's Gorgie Stand if given the go ahead.
Celtic introduced a safe standing section last summer.
The 2900-capacity section is used for domestic matches, with retractable seating that can be used for European fixtures.
