The teenager, who cannot be named because of his age, stands charged with four counts of rape and six counts of sexual assault against a woman or girl.
The alleged attack is said to have happened in the Black Mountain area of the city last Friday.
Police said the boy was also being investigated over a separate alleged rape in March.
He has not been charged over that incident, but inquiries are ongoing, the court was told.
Opposing his release, a detective claimed there was "an extremely similar modus operandi" between the two alleged attacks.
"There are a number of people who were present over the weekend when this took place that police have yet to speak to," she said.
During cross-examination the detective agreed that the accused fully cooperated with investigating officers.
A defence solicitor said his client insists any sexual contact was consensual.
The judge ordered the boy be held in custody to appear again by video-link on Friday.
