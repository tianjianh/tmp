A murder victim has been named by police in a bid to piece together his final weeks.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronald Smith, 65, was found at his home on Cottage Walk, West Bromwich on 2 June, but police believed he may have been killed up to four weeks earlier.
A post-mortem examination found he died from stab wounds.
A 60-year-old man from West Bromwich was arrested last week on suspicion of murder and bailed pending further inquiries.
Mr Smith has not been formally identified, but officers said his family had been informed and his name was being released to try to discover more information.
"We know that Ronald was alive on 5 May and we would ask anyone who knows his movements from that date to contact us," Det Insp Ian Iliffe said.
"From what we can establish so far, Ronald kept himself to himself, although we do know that he was a keen fisherman and was often spotted fishing on the local canal.
Det Insp Iliffe, who is leading the investigation, said Mr Smith often went to betting shops in the area and frequently visited local temples for meals as part of their community outreach work.
Police were called to Cottage Walk after neighbours became concerned for Mr Smith's welfare.
