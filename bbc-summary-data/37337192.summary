Leigh Centurions owner Derek Beaumont has confirmed they have already agreed to sign four players for their Super League return next season.

They have won all five games in the Qualifiers to secure a top-flight place for the first time since 2005.
Beaumont told BBC Radio Manchester four players have agreed moves with three or four more signings being considered.
"We've got signings which we've not announced yet because it is just not appropriate to do so," he said.
"We will be spending next year's full salary cap no matter what."
Before the Super 8s, Leigh won a third Championship title in a row after losing just one game during the season.
However it was not the smoothest start to the campaign with head coach Paul Rowley resigning 10 days before the season started, to be replaced by Neil Jukes.
"Paul Rowley chucking his towel in early doors was probably the best thing that could have happened to the club in hindsight" added Beaumont
"Jukesy has stepped in, I knew he could do the job, he's done a great job and the people that were unsettled last year moved on and we brought in players we thought could do the job.
"We set the players a little target at the beginning of the campaign that if we could get through without the Million Pound Game I'd take them all away and we'd match that game in the sun, and that's what is what we're going to do."
