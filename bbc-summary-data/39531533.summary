Winger Norton, 29, scored his 245th try to help his side beat South Korea 52-0 in the Hong Kong Sevens on Friday.
"It's an amazing feeling, it was hard with the record in sight to try and control my brain coming into it," said Norton, who made his debut in 2009.
"The exciting thing for Dan is he's still got a few years left in him," said England head coach Simon Amor.
England, who lie second in this season's overall standings behind South Africa, are chasing their first title in Hong Kong since 2006.
Norton's tally of 245 tries is one ahead of Kenya's Collins Injera who did not score as Kenya lost to Canada 17-14.
Norton starred in Great Britain's Rio Olympics 2016 campaign, when  they lost in the final to Fiji.
