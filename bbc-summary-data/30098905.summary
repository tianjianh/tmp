Andrew Hindes' Staffordshire Bull Terrier attacked Richard Lyon's Pekingese while it was off the leash in Aberdeen last summer.
Another of his dogs, a Rottweiler, also bit two other people while in his garden outside his flat.
Hindes, 27, was banned from owning a dog for a year and ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid community work.
Sheriff Noel McPartlin also ordered the destruction of the Rottweiler.
Ahead of sentencing at Aberdeen Sheriff Cout, fiscal depute Stephanie Ross recounted details of the attack.
She said: "The accused's dog managed to grab hold of Mr Lyon's dog and violently shook it.
"The accused ran down the lane and managed to pull the dogs apart.
"Mr Lyon's dog, also called Roxy, was motionless after the attack.
"It had a punctured spinal cord leaving it paralysed and it later died at the vet.
"Mr Lyon's daughter was extremely upset and required to be calmed down."
The court also heard that on two other occasions Hindes' other dog Gally had bitten two neighbours while in the garden.
Hindes admitted two counts of being in charge of the dog when it was dangerously out of control.
He had previously admitted being in charge of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier when it killed the other dog.
Defence agent Mike Munro said he had enlisted the help of a "dog behaviourist" to compile a report into the nature of the Rottweiler.
He said: "It tells us that this dog poses a danger to public safety. The dog's behaviour is such that there is an extreme concern."
The court heard that Hindes had given up both dogs in July this year and no longer owned a pet.
