[SN]TITLE[SN]
Wycombe Wanderers 0-2 Barnet

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mauro Vilhete and John Akinde's second-half strikes ended Barnet's six-game winless run and lifted them out of the League Two relegation zone with a 2-0 victory at Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vilhete tucked home in the 65th minute of a dour clash at Adams Park and, after Myles Weston saw red on his home debut, Akinde rubber-stamped the victory in injury time.
The hosts went into the clash with the third best home record in the division and could feel aggrieved not to lead at the break after Adebayo Akinfenwa's header was disallowed after referee Graham Horwood failed to play advantage.
Their best chance came early in the second half when Anthony Stewart unleashed a half-volley straight at Josh Vickers following a corner.
But it was the Bees who struck soon after as strong hold-up play by Akinde released Vilhete and the Portuguese 23-year-old's low shot crept under goalkeeper Jamal Blackman.
The hosts pushed for a leveller but lost Weston for two bookings in stoppage time, and Akinde then rounded the keeper to slot home and secure the Bees a vital win.
