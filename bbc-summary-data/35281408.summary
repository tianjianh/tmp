Steyn was injured during the first Test in Durban, missing the second in Cape Town as England earned a draw to retain a 1-0 lead in the four-match series.
The third Test will start on Thursday without the 32-year-old, who has missed four of South Africa's last six Tests because of injury.
"I don't think it's the end of Dale Steyn," said coach Russell Domingo.
"All players will experience some sort of niggles."
South Africa had included Steyn in their squad for the final two Tests of the series in the hope that he would be fit.
Domingo added: "He is a great athlete. He is as fit as they can come. We know he is a great bowler. He is the best bowler in the world."
