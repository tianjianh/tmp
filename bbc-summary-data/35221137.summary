Kenya's Garissa University College has officially reopened, nine months after the killing of nearly 150 people, mainly students, in an attack by militant Islamist group al-Shabab.

Staff have reported to work while students are expected to be back on campus next Monday.
A police post has been set up on the campus in north-eastern Kenya, to improve security.
Last year's attack was the deadliest so far by the Somali-based group in Kenya.
Following its closure, some 650 students from Garissa University College were offered places at a sister campus in Eldoret, western Kenya, to continue their studies.
They are not expected to return to Garissa now that it has reopened, university authorities say.
The French government has set up a fund for 109 students injured in the attack, putting 150,000 Kenyan shillings (Â£1,000; $1,500) towards each student's tuition fees and living allowance for the year.
The $500 allocated for fees is expected to cover roughly a third of the annual cost of tuition.
In May, local media reported that students at the Garissa Teachers Training College, which has a separate campus, but lies just 200m from the site of the attack, refused to return to class, citing security concerns.
Al-Shabab says it is opposed to the presence of Kenyan troops in neighbouring Somalia.
