The incident, which police said involved the use of an unspecified weapon, took place in Coatfield Lane, Leith, at about 20:30 on Saturday.
The victim is being treated for "multiple and significant injuries" in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.
Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
Det Ch Insp Martin Maclean said police were following a "positive line of inquiry".
He added: "It was a violent and sustained assault and included the use of a weapon.
"It does appear that those involved were known to one another and, consequently, I would like to reassure the local community that this has not been a random attack.
"There will be an increased police presence in and around Coatfield Lane whilst my team carry out investigations and officers search the area."
