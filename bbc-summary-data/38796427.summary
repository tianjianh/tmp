Former Chester and Kidderminster boss Burr, 57, joined the Sandgrounders in September to replace Andy Bishop when they were second bottom.
But they have lost their last three games and are only a point above the National League drop zone.
Watson, 46, has spent eight years as manager at Southport in two spells.
"Following a disappointing series of results the board have taken the above decision in the best interests of Southport to move forward in a different direction," said a club statement.
"With 19 players recruited during Steve Burr's tenure and significant financial backing to strengthen the squad, the performances and results recently have not shown signs that confirm the club can get to a position in the league that provides the security as required."
