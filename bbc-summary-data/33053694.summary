Two sign language interpreters have been found guilty of making false benefit claims and tax evasion of more than £1m in a scam that helped them pay for expensive holidays abroad.

Angela Poole, 49, of Derby and George Taylor, 56, formerly of Derby, made false claims through the Access of Work scheme.
They also evaded income tax, Derby Crown Court was told.
Poole, who denied the charges, was found guilty and jailed for four years.
Taylor, who pleaded guilty to two charges of fraud and one of cheating the public revenue, will be sentenced later.
Department for Work and Pensions spokesman Matthew Bentley said: "If Angela Poole was matching the level of work she claimed, she would have been working 21 hours a day to generate the £200,000 she was claiming a year.
"The pair spent much of the money travelling the world, often claiming for work while they were out of the country. She even claimed for £5,000 even though she was on holiday in Dubai."
Poole ran Angel Interpreting and BSL Talking Hands, two British sign language firms, along with Taylor.
The investigation also uncovered tax avoidance of more than £690,000 - making the total fraud more than £1m,  a revenue and customs (HMRC) spokesman said.
Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, said:  "Access to Work is a vital scheme that supports disabled people into employment and for someone to defraud it on this scale is appalling."
The couple falsely claimed they had provided the sign language work through two firms they operated between 2008 and 2013.
The department began investigating after it was tipped off by deaf people in Derby that the couple were making false claims.
"Tax fraud is a serious criminal offence and Poole must now pay the price for stealing money from taxpayers which could have been used to fund vital public services," Gary Forbes of the HMRC's criminal taxes unit said.
