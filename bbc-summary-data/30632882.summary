Overhead wire damage at Dunbar causes rail disruption

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail services between East Lothian and Edinburgh have been disrupted after an overhead wire problem at Dunbar.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Services between North Berwick/Dunbar and Edinburgh are expected to be affected until 19:00.
Replacement buses have been arranged between North Berwick/Drem/Prestonpans and Edinburgh.
Passengers travelling with CrossCountry, East Coast and ScotRail are affected. CrossCountry services to Edinburgh are terminating at Newcastle.
A bus service is operating between Newcastle and Edinburgh, while an amended service is running between Edinburgh and Glasgow Central/Dundee/Aberdeen.
East Coast has a reduced service running from Edinburgh towards Newcastle.
There are also difficulties for Scottish rail travellers due to overhead wire problems between Kilpatrick and Dalmuir.
This has led to disruption to journeys between Helensburgh/Balloch and Glasgow Queen Street.
A spokeswoman for ScotRail said: "Network Rail has experienced infrastructure problems this morning and is working to resolve these as soon as possible.
"We apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused. Replacement buses have been arranged where available."
David Dickson, Network Rail's Scotland route managing director, said: 'I'd like to apologise to all those affected by today's train disruption which was caused by the failure of overhead line equipment.
"The cause of the failure of the overhead line equipment is being investigated and we have not ruled out criminal damage.
