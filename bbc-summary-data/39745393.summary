Midfielder Jackson Irvine says Burton Albion have confounded the critics who felt they could not survive their first-ever campaign in the second tier.

The Brewers, 18th in the table, have all but secured a second season in the Championship, just eight years after winning the National League title.
"As a collective I think we've proved a lot of people wrong," Australian Irvine, 24, told BBC Radio Derby.
"We've shown we're capable of not just staying at this level but competing."
Irvine's 10 goals for the Brewers this season include the injury-time winner at Huddersfield and the decisive strike against rivals Derby.
And the former Celtic and Ross County player is not surprised that he and his team-mates have been troublesome opposition for even the best sides in the division.
"We've always been aware of the talent we've got in our dressing room," he said.
"We know that when we perform to our highest levels that we're capable of beating teams at both ends of the table."
The Australia international is understood to have attracted interest from top-flight sides after an impressive campaign and says he would jump at the chance to play Premier League football.
But he added he remains fully committed to Burton, who made him their record signing last summer.
"Every footballer strives to reach the top level and if that opportunity ever arose you'd bite someone's arm off for it," he said.
"But it is only my first season at this level and you want to prove yourself.
"I've got two years left on my contract here and at this point in time I'm fully focused on being a Burton Albion player."
