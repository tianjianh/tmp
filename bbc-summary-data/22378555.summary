He won a Bafta film award in 1989 for his supporting role in A Fish Called Wanda and received a special award in 2005.
Willis said Palin's "amiable on-screen manner belies the seriousness of his craft", adding there were "few individuals more worthy" of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts' highest honour.
