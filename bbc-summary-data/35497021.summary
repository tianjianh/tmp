Swansea City head coach Francesco Guidolin says Pep Guardiola's arrival at Manchester City next season will be good for the Premier League.

Guardiola will leave Bayern Munich in the summer to become Manchester City manager, replacing Manuel Pellegrini.
Italian Guidolin, who has also managed Udinese, spent time in Guardiola's company while observing Bayern Munich training.
"I'm happy for him to come to the Premier League," Guidolin said.
"Last year I went to Munich to see a Bundesliga match, Bayern Munich against Bayer Leverkusen.
"I saw training and talked with Pep, who was very kind. He's an important manager.
"Maybe next season all the most important managers will be in the Premier League and this is important for the Premier League."
Guidolin is one of 13 foreign managers currently in charge of Premier League clubs, following his appointment as Swansea head coach in January.
Former Spain international Guardiola, 45, won the Champions League twice during his five years in charge of Barcelona.
He has won two league titles and the German Cup since joining Bayern in summer 2013 and will take charge of City until July.
Italian striker Alberto Paloschi is poised to make his first start for Swansea in Saturday's Premier League match against Crystal Palace.
Paloschi, signed from Chievo for Â£8m, made his debut as a substitute in Tuesday's 1-1 draw at West Brom.
The 26-year-old impressed after replacing Ki Sung Yeung, who is out of the Palace match with concussion.
''I think he is ready for the game, maybe to start," Guidolin said.
''Alberto played well against West Brom. Normally I decide on the team the day before the match. ''
South Korean international Ki was stretchered off in the draw at West Brom and will not face Palace at the Liberty Stadium but Swansea are hopeful he will only miss one game.
Midfielder Leroy Fer, signed on loan from Queens Park Rangers on deadline day, will also come into contention.
Fer, 26, came under fire from Wales and Norwich striker Iwan Roberts, who accused the Dutchman of "going missing" when the going gets tough.
Guidolin admits he needs more time to get to know the Dutch international.
''We need players with ambition, motivation and with more qualities," Guidolin added.
"I have to speak to him because here we need players with these characteristics. I'm going to get that out of him.''
Guidolin is content with Swansea's recruitment during the January transfer window and is convinced his team will avoid relegation.
Swansea are unbeaten in three games ahead and are five points above the Premier League relegation zone.
"I think I have a good team and I have confidence we can take points," said Guidolin.
"I spoke to my players before training and I told them I'm happy and confident when we play our style.''
