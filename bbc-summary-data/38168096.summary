Olympic gold-medallists Geraint Thomas and Owain Doull are named in the men's road squad along with Luke Rowe.
Rio pursuit gold-medallist Elinor Barker is in the women's track endurance squad and silver medallist Becky James in the sprint line-up.
The podium programme is designed to support elite cyclists aiming to win medals in major competitions.
Doull, 23, switches from the track, where he was part of the British quartet that won the team pursuit in the 2016 Rio Olympics, to concentrate on road races.
The 22-year-old Barker won the Track World Cup points race in Appeldoorn, Netherlands in November.
James claimed silver medals in the sprint and keirin at the Rio Games after a long battle with injury following her 2013 World Championship gold medals in the same events.
