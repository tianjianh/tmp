Michael Artwell, Nikolas Redfearn and Mark Blacker were linked to the drugs, which were found at a property in Burnage, Manchester, and in a Range Rover stopped by police.
Officers searching the home on Newville Drive also discovered a firearm and 200 rounds of ammunition.
The three men were sentenced to a total of 34 years at Manchester Crown Court.
Greater Manchester Police officers arrested the trio after monitoring them over a period of several months last year.
Seven kilograms (15lbs) of heroin with an estimated street value of £1.2m was found at the home in Burnage, along with more than 20kg (45lb) of caffeine and paracetamol, ready to be used as an adulterant.
Cocaine with a street value of about £300,000 was found in the Range Rover.
Blacker, 30, of Derwent Street, Ordsall, Salford, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin, and was jailed for 12 years.
Redfearn, 40, of Thornlee Court, Grotton, Oldham, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and was sentenced to six years.
Redfearn also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a CS gas canister found in the Range Rover.
Artwell, 31, of Shillingford Road, Gorton, Manchester, was jailed for 16 years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin and possession of a firearm and ammunition.
After the men were sentenced, Det Insp Rob Cousen from Greater Manchester Police's serious organised crime group said: "Thanks to this operation and seizures, not only did we manage to prevent these drugs from making it on to our streets but we helped prevent anyone being injured.
"Not many people keep a firearm with hundreds of rounds of ammunition if they are not intent on using it at one point."
