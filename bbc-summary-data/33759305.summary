Councillors to visit Creag Riabhach wind farm site

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Highland councillors have decided to visit the proposed site for 22 turbines in Sutherland to help them consider the planning application.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
More than 200 objections have been lodged against Creag Riabhach wind farm near Altnahara.
Highland Council officers have recommended that the north planning applications committee approve the project.
Altnaharra Estate is working with a private local company on the scheme.
The developers have said Bettyhill, Strathnaver and Altnaharra, Durness, Tongue, and Kinlochbervie community councils support the project.
The Scottish government has sought Highland councillors' views on the development before taking a decision on the planning application.
