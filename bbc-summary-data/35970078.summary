WW2 sweethearts to wed 70 years after break-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wartime sweethearts are to get married - 70 years after they first called off their engagement.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Roy Vickerman proposed to 89-year-old Nora Jackson on his 90th birthday.
The couple, from Stoke-on-Trent, met at school in 1940 and got in engaged in 1946, but plans were halted when D-Day veteran Roy suffered post-traumatic stress from his wartime efforts.
Now, after being reunited through Graham Torrington's BBC radio show, they will finally tie the knot.
Romance blossomed again when Roy went to visit his former fiancee and hand her flowers, but as soon as Nora saw him on the door she threw her arms around him.
He proposed with exactly the same ring from their original engagement and said he could not be happier.
"I always thought a lot about Nora," he said.
"I still love her just the same as I did before."
Nora, who has been widowed, said she never expected to see Roy again, and was looking forward to their wedding.
"It's so wonderful, because I've been on my own here [for] 14 years," she said.
"Everything has been so happy for me to see him and be with him."
