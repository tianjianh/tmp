[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Robertson and David Goodwillie never faced a criminal trial but were ordered by a civil court ruling to pay £100,000 damages to Denise Clair.
She sued the pair after being "devastated" by the Crown's decision not to prosecute.
Cowdenbeath FC confirmed that 30-year-old Robertson had retired from professional football.
Ms Clair, who has waived her right to anonymity, claimed Robertson and Plymouth Argyle's Goodwillie raped her at a flat in Armadale, in West Lothian, after a night out in Bathgate in January 2011.
She said she could not remember what happened after being in a Bathgate bar and woke up in a strange flat the following morning.
The two former Dundee United players had claimed the sex was consensual.
The 30-year-old originally sought £500,000 in compensation, but damages were later agreed at £100,000 in the civil action at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday.
It was the first civil case of its kind in Scotland.
Cowdenbeath confirmed Robertson's retirement in a statement on its website.
Donald Findlay, Cowdenbeath FC chairman, said: "I wish to thank David for all his hard work during his stay at Central Park."
Plymouth Argyle said it would issue a statement on Goodwillie's future in the next few days.
