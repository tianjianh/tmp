Tom Condliff's NHS obesity fight 'is over'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 22-stone ex-policeman cannot appeal to the Supreme Court in an attempt to get a health authority to fund "life-saving" obesity surgery.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Tom Condliff, 62, of Stoke-on-Trent, lost his Court of Appeal battle to make North Staffordshire PCT pay for the procedure on Wednesday.
He said he needed the operation to save his life after becoming obese from the drugs he takes for long-term diabetes.
The Supreme Court has now rejected his application for a hearing.
Mr Condliff's solicitor Oliver Wright confirmed the refusal saying "it is the end of the line."
He said: "We could go to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, but that will take years and he will be dead well before that.
"He is a dying man. His doctors in April this year gave him about a year."
The grandfather has a body mass index (BMI) of 43 - not high enough under his PCT's rules to qualify for surgery.
Only patients with a BMI above 50 are routinely treated with weight loss surgery in North Staffordshire.
Mr Condliff's lawyers had argued that the PCT had applied a funding policy which was legally flawed and breached his human rights.
He lost a High Court battle over the PCT's decision not to fund the operation in April.
On Wednesday, Appeal Court judges expressed sympathy for Mr Condliff saying: "Anyone in his situation would feel desperate."
But they maintained the PCT "on proper medical advice does not consider his condition to be exceptional for someone with his diabetes, obesity and co-morbidities".
Mr Condliff also argued that it was also more cost effective for the NHS if he had the procedure.
The operation costs Â£5,500 and his current treatment costs at least Â£30,000 and will rise as his condition worsens, his solicitor said.
He suffers from 13 illnesses, takes 28 different drugs and uses breathing masks and inhalers.
