A goal by an amateur footballer with one leg has been named the Scottish Professional Football League's goal of the month.

Dundee United fan Tommy McKay scored during a half-time challenge at Tannadice last month.
The 32-year-old had his right leg amputated as a child after he was found to have bone cancer.
He beat professional players including Jayden Stockley, Tom Rogic and Joe Dodoo to win 80% of the public vote.
Tommy made no mention of his disability when he entered the McEwan Fraser Legal #HomeAdvantage Challenge competition for a chance of winning a hospitality ticket, but was welcomed into the contest.
His goal, during the half-time entertainment at Dundee United's match against Dunfermline on 8 November, earned a huge roar from the 6,000-strong crowd.
Tommy travelled half the length of the pitch on crutches before lobbing the ball past keeper Brett Long and into the back of the net.
Footage of the goal has since been viewed more than two million times after it was posted on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon is to award Tommy a commemorative trophy plus a season ticket for season 2017-18 for winning the accolade.
Tommy said he was overwhelmed to have won and thanked everyone who voted for him.
He said: "To have been chosen as the Ladbrokes SPFL goal of the month for November is completely overwhelming and is truly beyond my wildest dreams, especially when all the goals this month were worthy winners."
He added: "You will never know how much this means to me and my family and I am eternally grateful."
His goal came in the same week that Scottish charity Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS) was launched with the aim of growing the sport of amputee football in Scotland.
Tommy, from Monifieth in Angus, has been a lifelong fan of Dundee United.
He believes football saved his life as his cancer only came to light when, as an eight-year-old boy, he snapped his femur while attempting a Johan Cruyff turn.
He has continued to play football throughout his adult life and is now midfielder for Scotland's only amputee team, Partick Thistle Amputees FC.
His goal at Tannadice helped persuade McEwan Fraser Legal to provide financial support for the amputee team to attend its first international fixture next year in Limerick.
