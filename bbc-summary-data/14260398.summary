The fee was agreed 11 days ago and the deal includes a buy-back clause of 10m euros after one year and 15m euros after two for the Spanish champions.
Romeu will arrive at Stamford Bridge once he has finished playing for Spain at the Under-20 World Cup in Colombia.
The 19-year-old has played in both of their games so far, a 4-1 victory over Costa Rica and 2-0 win over Ecuador.
The 19-year-old made two first-team appearances for Barca last season, making his first-team debut at the end of last season, but he was not part of boss Pep Guardiola's long-term plans at the Nou Camp.
Romeu, who spent most of the campaign playing for their B team in the Spanish second division, said earlier this week: "Chelsea is a great option for me.
"Leaving Barca hurts, but you have to take your chances."
The signing is a boost for new Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas who will be without Michael Essien for six months.
The Ghana international, 28, ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus during pre-season training.
