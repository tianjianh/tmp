The sudden death of PC Andy Hocking, who was 52, triggered an "unprecedented outpouring of grief", according to local businesses in Falmouth, Cornwall.
He died while off duty in March.
About 6,000 people attended a tribute march involving members of Devon and Cornwall Police and other emergency services to pay their respects.
The community-funded memorial is being unveiled on Friday by the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police and several town leaders.
PC Andy Hocking's shoulder badge, number 4270, is also being presented to the town.
Andy Hocking's widow Sally Hocking said: "I miss him constantly and, like everybody in Falmouth, I look for him in all his 'usual' places when I'm walking through the town. These amazing footprints will continue to remind me that he is never far away from us."
The tribute has been organised by the Falmouth Business Improvement District (BID) and Falmouth Town Council's Town Management function, with the help of PC Hocking's family.
Falmouth's Mayor, John Body said: "The plaques are sited at spots where Andy, with his infectious smile would regularly be seen. I'm pleased that his contribution to our town as the epitome of local policing, is now retained for posterity."
Shaun Sawyer, Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police, said: "It is an extraordinary, generous and welcoming addition, so resonant to the spirit of Falmouth and reflects the nature of Andy who wanted to be on the streets and with the public whom he loved, and who loved him."
