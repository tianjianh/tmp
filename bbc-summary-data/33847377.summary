A watch auctioned by model Cara Delevingne, to aid University of Oxford researchers who studied Cecil the lion, has sold for £9,300.

American dentist, Walter Palmer, tracked and shot Cecil, a lion in Zimbabwe who was being studied by the university, last month.
Andy Loveridge, from WildCRU at the university's Department of Zoology, said it was "deeply grateful" to Ms Delevingne.
She said the killing was "a tragedy".
The starting bid for the TAG Heuer Signature Edition watch on ebay was £1.
WildCRU had satellite-tracked the famous lion's movements since 2008.
The project will now study the effect of Cecil's death on the surviving lions in his pride, including his cubs.
An appeal by the conservation unit has received more than £550,000 in donations since the animal was killed by Mr Palmer with a crossbow.
Writing on her Instagram account, Ms Delevingne said: "The killing of Cecil the Lion was a tragedy.
"Help the scientists who care about the future of wild lions in Africa and work very hard on their conservation."
Prof David Macdonald, director of WildCRU, said: "This money will help maintain and expand the Hwange programme, supporting Lion conservation for the future."
He added £9,300 could pay for six tracking collars or could fund the Hwange Lion Programme's anti-poaching patrol for about six months.
The watch was bought by an anonymous bidder.
