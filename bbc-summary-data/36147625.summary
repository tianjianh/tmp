The world's most advanced jet fighters from the US Air Force have taken to the skies in mid Wales.

Earlier this month, F-22 Raptor jets were deployed to the UK for training.
On Tuesday, they were seen flying the so-called Machynlleth Loop - known for low-level training - attracting aviation enthusiasts and photographers.
It was the first time Raptor pilots had flown the loop. They were anticipated to fly again over Gwynedd on Wednesday but instead flew to Lithuania.
The jets were deployed from the 95th Fighter Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida and will continue training in Europe until early next week.
They are stationed at the US Air Force base at RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk, home to the 48th Fighter Wing, which operates the much older F-15 aircraft.
Meanwhile, a Belgian naval flotilla is continuing a training operation off the Gwynedd coast.
Minehunter BNS Lobelia and support ship BNS Godetia arrived just off Cilan Head near Abersoch on Monday evening after leaving Brest, France, on Sunday.
On Tuesday night, a third naval vessel, BNS Pollux, arrived.
BBC Wales understands the exercise is a test for a group of 30 student officers who are nearing the end of their training.
