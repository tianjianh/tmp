[SN]TITLE[SN]
Pro12: Edinburgh 45-10 Benetton Treviso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh secured a first bonus-point of the season inside 32 minutes as they ended a run of three straight defeats with a comfortable win over Treviso.

Wing Damien Hoyland sprinted from his own 22 to score the opener and Hamish Watson stormed over for the second.
Hoyland exchanged passes with Michael Allen for his second before Magnus Bradbury exposed more slack defence.
Marco Fuser crossed for Treviso but Tom Brown grabbed his own brace, with Blair Kinghorn adding a seventh late on.
Impressive fly-half Jason Tovey kicked 10 points, with the only downside for Edinburgh the sight of back-rowers Nasi Manu and Bradbury being forced off with injuries in the final 10 minutes.
Edinburgh played at a tempo and with an ambition that was rarely the norm under former coach Alan Solomons. They looked hungry for ball and relished open space, of which there was acres.
Hoyland scored his first when running in from 80 metres. Then, Watson added a second inside eight minutes when he spun out of some non-tackles from Treviso. Tovey banged over both conversions and even that early in the match, it was done as a contest.
Tommaso Allan landed a penalty but Hoyland went over in the corner for his second try before the half-hour and, just after, Bradbury went through more disgraceful Treviso defence.
That was the bonus point wrapped up in 32 minutes. Tovey added the extras to make it 26-3 at the break.
The Italians have not won an away match in the Pro 12 since the end of 2014 and even that one was in Italy, against Zebre.
Routinely they concede big numbers on the road. Ospreys put 64 points on them a few weeks back. They are fodder. You have to ask - what is the point of Treviso?
They missed 56% of their tackles in that opening half - 20 in total. They were an utter shambles. In the opening minutes of the second half they mustered a try of their own, a close-range drive from Fuser, but Edinburgh just went down the other end and the excellent Tovey threw a skip-pass to Brown, who darted over for Edinburgh's fifth try.
With Tovey's conversion, Edinburgh led 33-10. That went to 40-10 when Tovey's gorgeous cross-field kick was fielded by Brown, who crashed over.
Just before the end, Kinghorn was put away up the left wing after more than a dozen phases for an excellent seventh try.
Coach Duncan Hodge's Murrayfield debut was a pleasing one, even allowing for the wretchedness of the opposition. Edinburgh made a lot of errors but at least the mistakes came when trying to play, when attempting to make things happen. Progress for sure.
If Hodge wants his team to play with more ambition, then good. If he wants to give his backline a bit of freedom to play, then that's what every Edinburgh fan has been crying out for.
This will probably be their easiest game of the season against the softest of soft touches, but if there is to be any kind of renaissance after the dog days of the Solomons era, then it had to start somewhere. This was an encouraging beginning.
