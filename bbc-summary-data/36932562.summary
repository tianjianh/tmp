The 20-year-old is yet to feature for Albion at senior level but did play eight times during a loan spell at non-league Kidderminster last season.
"I can't wait to work with him," boss Adam Murray told the club website.
"He has the physical attributes, tremendous speed and the background of being at a Premier League club to be effective in League Two."
