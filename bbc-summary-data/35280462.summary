This is the BBC's exciting new campaign. Together we'll be inspiring and empowering each other to feel as happy, healthy and confident as we can.
We want to know what makes YOU #BodyPositive. We asked a few well known faces for their ideas and we took to the streets to find out more. Take a look!
We'd love to hear from you on social media. Tweet us, visit us on Facebook and Instagram and get BodyPositive!
