Two Cardiff recycling 'super sites' to save £300k

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff council is proposing to cut its four waste recycling centres to two as a way to boost recycling rates.

It is consulting on plans to expand its bases at Bessemer Close, Leckwith, and Wedal Road, Roath, into recycling "super sites".
The other premises at Lamby Way and Waungron Road would close.
A report says 80% of current waste could be recycled and that the changes would provide more staff to encourage this, as well as saving £300,000.
The proposal comes as Cardiff council faces an overall budget shortfall of £50m in 2014/15.
The local authority says its four sites, which are free to use and open seven days a week, are running at only 50% capacity.
The Bessemer Close plant is the least used at only 29% while the existing Wedal Road plant is running at almost full capacity.
The proposed new Wedal Road super site would back on to the existing recycling centre and would open in the autumn of this year.
Cardiff's four current sites take recycling, composting and waste materials from householders but not from businesses.
The report putting the reduction proposals out for consultation claims up to 80% of the waste dumped by householders could be recycled.
It says the changes would "improve the customer experience with additional staff at the new super sites to help visitors recycle more of their waste".
The drive to increase the rate of recycling comes as the council strives to reach the Welsh government's recycling target of 58% by 2015 or face fines of up to £200,000 on each percentage shortfall.
Cardiff's recycling rate is currently 52%.
The council's cabinet has put forward proposals for £4.9m of cuts to help bridge a £50m budget shortfall for 2014/15.
Under the plans some staff's working hours would be cut by an hour per week and senior managers pay cut by 2.7%.
