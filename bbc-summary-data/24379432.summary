There will soon be 1.4 billion smartphones in the world. They keep us connected and informed and now thanks to a booming market in fitness apps, they help keep us healthy too.
Moves on the iPhone and Noom Walk on Android are smartphone apps to track the number of steps taken. Fitness experts agree that around 10,000 steps a day is a good target for a healthy adult - that is a lot of tracking.

If that is a bit too physical, a relaxing journey across the world from a birds-eye viewpoint can be achieved with YouTube channel World from Above HD.
Flickr group Landscape Photographers of Los Santos and Blaine County has been set up to capture the scenery of computer game Grand Theft Auto. The collection is filled with screenshots taken by gamers using the free iFruit iOS app.
