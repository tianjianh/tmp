Roy Hodgson: England manager wants winter meeting for squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Boss Roy Hodgson wants to resurrect plans for a winter meeting for his England squad - an idea previously vetoed by Premier League clubs.

England beat France 2-0 in a friendly at Wembley on Tuesday but do not play again until March.
Hodgson wants to spend time with the players to keep the team spirit intact, after a run of 13 wins from 16 games since the 2014 World Cup.
"I would like an afternoon or early evening with the players," he said.
"We can go through a little bit of what we have done in the Spain game and the France game and see what we want to do going forward.
"I am hoping that the clubs will go along with that. To be honest there wasn't an enormous amount of opposition to it last time around.
"I guess with any luck we will get that afternoon but it will have to be discussed with the clubs to make sure they think it is an afternoon that is right for them because I and (assistant) Ray Lewington are full-timers and can go any time it suits them."
England will build up to next summer's European Championship with March friendlies against world champions Germany in Berlin and Netherlands at Wembley.
With injured players coming back into contention next year, Hodgson will add up to another four friendlies in the build-up to the tournament in France, which starts in June.
"We are hoping to have at least three warm-up games, possibly four, in addition to the two in March so we will have games," Hodgson added.
