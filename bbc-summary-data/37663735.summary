[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hartlepool United 1-3 Leyton Orient

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient recorded their first win in seven games with a competent 3-1 victory at Hartlepool.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was a first win for new Os boss Alberto Cavasin while defeat leaves Hartlepool without a victory in seven games at home this season.
Orient had the best openings in the first half but trailed at the break.
A deep free-kick saw Ollie Palmer head against the crossbar, but Pools took the lead in first-half injury time.
A corner from Lewis Alessandra was nodded back at goal by Lewis Hawkins for Josh Laurent to knock in his first professional goal.
Hawkins was denied a second by a fine, one-handed save from Alex Cisak and three minutes later the Os levelled.
Sandro Semedo was picked out on the right side of the area and his low shot beat keeper Trevor Carson at the near post in the 55th minute.
Palmer got his first goal seven minutes later, curling his finish low around Carson.
The striker doubled his tally in the 71st minute when he was fed by Gavin Massey and made no mistake.
