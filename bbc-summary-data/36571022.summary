The 33-year-old centre-back is the Shakers first new arrival this summer.
Kay, who has signed a two-year deal, started his career at Barnsley and has played at Tranmere and Huddersfield.
"Antony is a player we have been pursuing for the last six months and I am absolutely delighted to reveal him as our first summer signing," boss David Flitcroft told the club website.
"We have been working on securing his services since Christmas. He is a player of great character and has the leadership qualities required to reduce our goals conceded stats for next season."
