[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Strikes planned by ScotRail workers are off for the time being to allow further talks with union bosses.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union are fighting plans to have drivers instead of guards operate the doors on some services.
The union insist the dispute is about "ensuring that Scotland's trains run safely".
But ScotRail said the RMT had been running a campaign of "disinformation that doesn't bear any scrutiny".
In a statement, RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: "The union has made sufficient progress to enable us to suspend the current programme of industrial action on ScotRail to allow for further detailed discussions on the issue of platform train despatch procedures.
"The progress we have been able to make in this dispute is entirely down to the resilience, determination and strength of our ScotRail members who have taken wave after wave of rock-solid action in defence of rail safety.
"They are a credit to the entire trade union movement."
ScotRail have said a solution to the dispute is "in talks not strikes".
Phil Verster, Managing Director of the ScotRail Alliance said: "I am really pleased for our customers and our people that the RMT have accepted our request to suspend further industrial action.
"Doing this allows us to get round the table and finalise an agreement that will, hopefully, bring this dispute to an end."
Mr Verster said they would keep a second member of staff on board their trains to look after our customers.
He added: "We have made a very positive proposal that we will now seek agreement on. If it is agreed, it would mean that conductors could concentrate on delivering an even better service to our customers.
"It would also mean that our trains will be more punctual and would allow us to deliver faster journeys."
