Six Nations 2016: Great England v Wales title showdowns of the past

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
It is a match that needs no added incentives but.... the England v Wales Six Nations title showdown has added spice.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England are on course for a Grand Slam, while a Wales win would be a giant step towards them winning a fourth title under Warren Gatland.
Something has to to give.
So we have delved into the BBC archive to find matches where Grand Slams and title hopes have been dashed in these cross-border collisions matches.
So, in chronological order:

Between 1978 and 2005, Wales missed two chances to win the Five Nations Grand Slam.
The first came in the Triple Crown season of 1988 when they lost to France in their final game, then in 1994 Ieuan Evans led Wales to Twickenham after wins over Scotland, Ireland and France.
England were in no mood to be guests at a Welsh party and came out 15-8 winners.
Wales won the title but captain Evans did not appear delighted when he received the trophy from the Queen after losing at Twickenham.

Fast forward to 1999 and it was England who were on the Grand Slam trail with Wales - playing a home game in Wembley - having won only one of their three matches.
England dominated until the moment Scott Gibbs ran through their defence and into the history books.
It still needed Neil Jenkins' conversion to seal the win and hand the title to Scotland.
Jenkins did not miss often - and nailed the kick to bring down the curtain on the final Five Nations championship before Italy's arrival.

The 2013 match saw England needing a win to secure a first Grand Slam in 10 years, while Wales needed a seven-point margin of victory to claim the title.
It was tight amid the tumult of a cacophonous Millennium Stadium until Wales wing Alex Cuthbert scored two tries in quick succession mid-way through the second half.
Wales' 27-point winning margin gave them the title in style.
