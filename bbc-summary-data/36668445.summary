The 35-year-old has agreed a deal for the coming season after being released by English League One club Rochdale.
Holt told Hibs TV: "I said to the gaffer I'm not here just to sit and help the young lads along.
"I've come to play football. I've been out a long time with my knee, I've come back and I'm fit. I want to score goals and enjoy my football."
Lennon, who left Bolton Wanderers after their relegation from the Championship in England, took over at Easter Road this summer after the departure of Alan Stubbs to Rotherham United.
"We're delighted to be able to secure a player of Grant's quality," said the Northern Irishman. "He'll bring good experience to the group but he's here to play and has plenty to contribute on the field.
"The fact that he has chosen to come here over other clubs who were interested in him speaks volumes about his commitment and desire to do well here.
"He's exactly the type of player we were looking for and I am sure he'll prove to be very valuable to the team."
Lennon was keen to bring in striker re-enforcements after Anthony Stokes joined Blackburn Rovers at the end of his loan spell from Celtic, with Motherwell's Australian striker Scott McDonald - who has an option of another year at Fir Park - also on his radar.
"Ideally, we would like to add a couple of names and, even when the European game comes around, it will not be finalised," he told BBC Scotland on Tuesday.
"I'm sure there will also be a couple of players moving out the door, either on loan or permanently."
Holt began his career with Workington and also played for Halifax Town, Sorrento, Barrow, Sengkang Marine, Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Blackpool and Shrewsbury Town before joining Norwich.
He spent four years at Carrow Road, helping the Norfolk outfit to the Premier League, before moving to Wigan in 2013.
Holt had loan spells with Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers before joining Rochdale in February.
He made 14 appearances, but only three starts, scoring twice for the Spotland outfit.
