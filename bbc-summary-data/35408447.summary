No fatalities period on stretch of A9 longest in 37 years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The longest period of time without a fatal crash on the A9 between Inverness and Dunblane since 1978 has been recorded, the A9 Safety Group has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There were no lives lost in accidents on the stretch of road between July and December last year.
The group, whose partners include Police Scotland, Highland Council and Road Safety Scotland, said average speed cameras had made the A9 safer.
Six people have died since the network of cameras went live in October 2014.
Police Scotland has ruled out excessive speed - something the cameras are designed to tackle - or overtaking manoeuvres as the cause of those fatal accidents.
Transport Minister Derek Mackay said the reduction in fatalities was welcome.
But he added that every road death was "one too many" and the Scottish government and its partners were "steadfastly committed" to making the road safer.
Government agency Transport Scotland's accident database holds reports going back to 1978.
The A9 Safety Group said that at that time the A9 was undergoing a major upgrade, "making a direct comparison with any earlier period problematic".
