[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A deal to take over a debt-ridden hospital in Somerset by a neighbouring health trust has been called off.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Weston General, run by Weston Area Health NHS Trust, has been running at an annual Â£5m loss for several years.
The NHS Trust Development Authority (NHS TDA) said the "business case" for a partnership with Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust "did not represent a sustainable future".
It said its priority was "high quality care in a sustainable way".
Anne Eden, from the NHS TDA, said: "Since we started this process with the trust, the world has moved on."
She said they were looking at "new ways" of providing care to patients while "dealing with a financially challenging time".
"As such we need to think differently about what the future looks like for Weston.
"The two organisations would not represent a clinically or financially viable organisation, and as a result, an acquisition is not the right solution in this case."
