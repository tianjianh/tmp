Michael Appleton: Oxford United head coach set to join Leicester City as assistant

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The future of Michael Appleton as Oxford United head coach is set to be decided amid reports he will join Leicester City as assistant manager.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Former Portsmouth, Blackpool and Blackburn boss Appleton, 41, has been in charge of the U's for three years.
He guided them to automatic promotion from League Two as well as two Wembley finals in the Football League Trophy.
Neither Appleton, Oxford United or Leicester City have responded to BBC Sport for comment since Thursday.
Appleton is understood to have told Oxford players over the weekend that he will be leaving to join Craig Shakespeare's managerial team at Leicester.
Shakespeare was confirmed as the Foxes' permanent manager on a three-year deal earlier this month having temporarily taken charge in February following Claudio Ranieri's sacking.
The uncertainty surrounding Appleton's future at Oxford was compounded on Saturday as transfer target Liam Lindsay opted not to join from Partick Thistle.
Partick had accepted a Â£300,000 bid for the 21-year-old centre-back, but Lindsay was understood to be reluctant to move if a managerial change was imminent.
