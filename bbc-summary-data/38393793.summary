Lisa Marie Naegle, 36, who competed in 2010 for a dream wedding and plastic surgery on the show Bridalplasty, last spoke to her husband early on Sunday.
Police arrested a 34-year-old nursing student, Jackie Jerome Rogers, on Tuesday after questioning him.
They said he told investigators Ms Naegle's body was at his home.
"We can confirm a body which we believe is Lisa Marie was discovered in a shallow grave at the suspect's home," police spokesman Sal Ramirez said on Tuesday night of the discovery in Lennox, near Los Angeles International Airport.
"The detectives strongly believe it is her."
Police did not give a motive for the killing.
Ms Naegle was hit on the head seven times with a hammer early on Sunday morning, reports celebrity gossip website TMZ, citing law enforcement sources.
The Daily Breeze, a local newspaper, reported that she taught nursing classes at West Los Angeles College and that Mr Rogers was one of her students.
She had gone to a birthday party on Saturday night at Alpine Village, a beer hall and restaurant in another Los Angeles suburb, Torrance.
Ms Naegle's husband, Derek Harryman, said he had texted her at around 02:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Sunday to find out where she was.
"Within a minute or two, she called me," Mr Harryman told the Daily Breeze.
"She sounded really, really drunk. She said, 'I'm going to get some food and then I'll be home.'"
But she never made it.
Her family reported her missing on Sunday night and issued an appeal on social media for help in finding her.
They said they obtained photos showing Ms Naegle - who came fourth on E! network's Bridalplasty - leaving the beer hall with Mr Rogers.
Ms Naegle's relatives contacted Mr Rogers after they obtained CCTV footage which appeared to show her getting into the suspect's vehicle.
Her sister, Danielle Naegle-Kaimona, told KABC-TV: "While he was talking to us and telling us his story, multiple different times he said he absolutely did not go home with her, or did not take her home."
After being challenged that Ms Naegle had been filmed getting into his car, Mr Rogers changed his story, the family said.
He acknowledged that the missing woman did get into his car, but said she got out moments later.
The family then contacted police.
