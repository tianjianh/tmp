Hamilton Academical manager Martin Canning has extended his own playing contract with the Scottish Premiership club for another 12 months.

Defender Jesus Garcia Tena and midfielder Danny Redmond have also agreed new contracts.
Canning played only three times this season and injury problems had him considering retirement.
"I'll probably sign on for another year as a player," the 34-year-old defender said earlier this month.
Canning signed a one-year rolling contract to manage the New Douglas Park outfit after Alex Neil's departure to Norwich City in January 2015.
"I will certainly be available to play and maybe try and help the kids by playing some under-20s games," he said.
"I'm keen to play. I'll do pre-season. People tell me you're ready to retire when pre-season makes you feel sick, but I'm not there yet.
"I'm looking forward to get going again. If I can play a part, I'll be there to do it."
Canning's only starting appearance came in a 4-2 defeat at home to St Johnstone in October and he last appeared as a late substitute in a 0-0 draw with Dundee United in February.
However, off the field, he guided his side clear of relegation trouble for the second year running as Accies finished 10th.
Meanwhile, fellow central defender Garcia Tena, the Spaniard who signed for Accies from Livingston in 2013 and made 25 appearances this season, has signed a new 12-month contract.
Redmond, who joined Accies after leaving Wigan Athletic in 2014, has secured a contract until May 2018 despite only playing 12 times this season.
