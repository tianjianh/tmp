Sales of Harris Tweed last year amounted to 1.7 million metres, the industry's governing body has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Harris Tweed Authority revealed the figure following an event promoting the hand-woven cloth in London.
The figure is almost four times the amount of tweed sold when the Western Isles-based industry was having difficulties less than a decade ago.
Seven years ago, sales of the product had dropped to 450,000 metres.
The textile is hand-woven at home by the islanders of Lewis, Harris, Uist and Barra using wool that has been dyed and spun in the islands.
Harris Tweed Hebrides, the main producer of the fabric, exports to 60 countries.
