The Scottish government said this second phase of pilots - stretching from Dumfries to Shetland - was due to begin by the summer of 2017.
In November, it was announced that Aberdeen, Edinburgh and the Scottish Borders would be the first test areas.
Ministers said they were working to improve how parents accessed free childcare, which is due to rise from 600 to 1,140 hours a year by 2020.
Some parents have said they struggle to access the existing free entitlement, given to all three and four year olds and vulnerable two year olds, because of a lack of flexibility.
The pilots will try out models including;
These will commence by summer 2017
These will commence in January 2017
The first phase beginning in January will see the Borders introduce extended days and cover for school holidays.
There will also be a "stay and play" scheme for two year olds in Aberdeen and a woodland play area scheme in Edinburgh will be extended.
The cost of the 14 trials will be Â£950,000.
Minister for Childcare and Early Years Mark McDonald said that providing better access to "high-quality early learning and childcare (ELC)" was key to improving attainment.
He added: "By giving Scotland's young people the best possible start in life we can ensure they develop the skills and confidence they need to reach their full potential.
"This government is committed to almost doubling the free entitlement to 1,140 hours per year by 2020, while delivering the flexibility that families need.
"By trialling different delivery models in partnership with local authorities we will be better able to understand what parents and children need and want."
