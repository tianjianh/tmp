Jonny Hayes: Cardiff City and Celtic compete for Aberdeen winger

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cardiff City and Celtic are competing to sign Aberdeen winger Jonny Hayes.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Cardiff are believed to have offered Â£1.2m for the former Leicester City player, who worked with Celtic manager Brendan Rogers while a trainee with Reading.
Hayes has a contract at Pittodrie until the summer of 2019.
He has made 206 Aberdeen appearances in all competitions, scoring 29 goals, since joining from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2012.
Cardiff manager Neil Warnock has been a long-time admirer and tried to sign him twice in the January transfer window.
Birmingham City have also been linked with the player.
A potential move to Celtic Park for the winger could also be a cash-plus-player deal involving Ryan Christie.
The 22-year old midfielder enjoyed a successful loan period at Pittodrie last season.
