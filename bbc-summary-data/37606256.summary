Dickie Jeeps: Former British and Irish Lions and England scrum-half dies at 84

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former British and Irish Lions scrum-half and England captain Dickie Jeeps has died at the age of 84.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jeeps' first Lions tour was in 1955 to South Africa, and he appeared 13 times across three separate tours.
He also played for England 24 times, captaining the side on 13 occasions, and at club level played for Cambridge and Northampton Saints.
He served as Rugby Football Union president between 1976-77 and was awarded the CBE in 1977.
Former Saints stalwart David Powell told BBC Radio Northampton: "People ask me who were the greatest scrum-halves I've seen and you look at Gareth Edwards and Jeeps are very close.
"They're different sort of players but Dick was an amazing player. He had this great power and strength for a small man."
