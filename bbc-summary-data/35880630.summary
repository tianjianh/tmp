Loganair will continue to operate the route with Â£800,000 of funding supporting the six-month extension.
The UK and Scottish governments and Dundee City Council agreed to extend the current public service obligation contract.
Loganair operates two daily flights each way each weekday, with a further flight on a Sunday.
The UK government funding is through the Regional Air Connectivity Fund, which aims to maintain connectivity between London and smaller regional airports, where routes are at risk of being withdrawn.
Scottish government Transport Minister Derek Mackay said: "The extension of the public service obligation on the Dundee-Stansted route is a welcome and important step for the future of the airport.
"All parties have worked together to reach an agreement that will see the route safeguarded in the immediate future, with a view to reaching a longer-term solution in due course.
Dundee City Council leader Ken Guild said: "I am pleased that the partners in this route have agreed that the backing for it will be extended.
"We will continue to work with them to encourage as many people as possible to use the service."
