The 22-year-old Commonwealth Games silver medallist lost 21-15, 21-9 to third seed Sindhu.
"Of course I'm disappointed with the result in the final," said Gilmour. "The shuttle felt so sensitive today.
"I tried everything in my power to get it under control and find some rhythm. I managed it in some rallies but not consistently enough."
Gilmour is Britain's top ranked women's singles player and won the Dutch Grand Prix in October.
