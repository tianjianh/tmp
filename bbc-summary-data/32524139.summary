Councillors on the planning committee voted 7-2 in favour of granting consent for the development in Central Square.
The committee heard how building work will begin on the site of the current bus station later this year.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Welsh government turned down a request from Cardiff Civic Society to call in the planning permission.
The news has been welcomed by the developers Rightacres, BBC Wales, Network Rail and the chief executive of Cardiff council.
Director of BBC Wales, Rhodri Talfan Davies, said: "This is another important milestone as we plan our move from the outdated facilities in Llandaff to a new broadcast centre in the beating heart of our capital city."
Council chief executive Paul Orders added: "This is an exciting phase in the development of our city."
