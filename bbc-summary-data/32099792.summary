[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Belfast man accused of beating his partner with a crutch and his plastered foot has been refused bail.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In court was David James Carlton, 26, from Great Victoria Street.
He faces a number of charges including attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm and possessing a weapon - a crutch - with intent to cause GBH.
A judge said it was "one of the worst types" of domestic violence he had seen.
"I'm not even going to dream of entertaining a release on bail," he added.
Mr Carlton is also accused of causing criminal damage to various items including a TV and mobile phone, stealing his alleged victim's keys and SIM card, false imprisonment, causing actual bodily harm, common assault and breaching a non-molestation order on dates between 24-26 March this year.
Giving evidence to the court, a detective constable said a neighbour of the alleged victim called police to report that his neighbour had been beaten up by her boyfriend.
She said when officers arrived at her property in the Cregagh estate, they noticed multiple injuries including - cuts and bruises to her head, "footwear marks" to her head and stomach and multiple bruises to her hands, arms and stomach.
The officer said the alleged victim had claimed that Mr Carlton, who appeared in the dock with his foot in plaster and walking with a crutch, had used the crutch and injured foot to "hit her  repeatedly" before damaging her TV, a radiator and a vase.
A defence solicitor said his client's case was that his ex-partner called him claiming to have been attacked by three men so he went "to comfort her" even though that was a breach of the non-molestation order.
Refusing the bail application however, the judge said that "on the face of it, this is one of the worst types of domestic violence".
Remanding Mr Carlton into custody to appear again on 17 April, the judge also declared there was "no way in the world" that the case should stay in the lower courts but should be prosecuted in the Crown Court.
