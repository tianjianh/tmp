The Rams took the lead in the 56th minute when Darren Bent slotted in from six yards after Nick Blackman's shot had been pushed on to the post.
They held that advantage until the 95th minute when Mike Jones fired in.
Five penalties were missed in the dramatic shootout before Elsnik, 18, chipped in to send Derby through.
Elsnik, who was making his professional debut, was one of six Derby and Carlisle players to take two penalties in the shootout.
He told the Championship club's website: "It was a very special night for me to get on the pitch for the first team for the first time.
"We only picked out first five players to step up so I didn't know what was going to happen after that. The coaches asked who wanted to go and the other players voted for me to take one.
"I was calm and confident and I was glad to see that first one hit the back of the net. At that point, you don't expect to be taking another one.
"It kept going, both teams kept scoring, and it is probably the longest penalty shootout I have ever seen."
Despite defeat, Carlisle boss Keith Curle was pleased with his League Two side's performance: "We knew we had to come here and give them problems, we had to tempt them out and there were situations when we were breaking on them.
"The players had to be brave under pressure, suck them in and then hit them and I thought at times it worked a treat. We played Championship football."
