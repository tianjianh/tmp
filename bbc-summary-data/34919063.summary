Called ROOT 1066, it will run from 1 September 2016 to the anniversary on 14 October.
There will be exhibitions plus a "large scale sound and light event" on the seafront which will be beamed across the Channel to Normandy.
Hastings Borough Council leader Peter Chowney said the impact of the Norman Conquest could not be underestimated.
"It laid down the bedrock of English language and culture," he said. "That's why we've called the festival 'ROOT' 1066."
He added: "We hope that people from across the country, Europe and beyond will be able to visit our town and enjoy this festival, and appreciate how this corner of Sussex became the birthplace of modern English culture, in all its diverse and kaleidoscopic variations."
During the festival the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings; the De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill and Hastings Museum and Art Gallery will hold exhibitions
The series of events are being funded by Hastings Borough Council and Arts Council England.
