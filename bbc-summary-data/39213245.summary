Hosts Zambia reached the final of the Under-20 Africa Cup of Nations for the first time after beating South Africa 1-0 after extra-time in Lusaka.

Edward Chilufya finally broke the deadlock in the 108th minute as he headed home Proper Chiluya's free-kick.
Play had to be stopped for six minutes during extra-time after teargas fired outside the stadium filtered inside.
The Zambians will meet either Senegal or Guinea, who meet in Ndola on Thursday, in Sunday's final.
Zambia's previous best finish in the tournament was a fourth-placed finish in 2007.
The team also reached the semi-finals of the competition's forerunner, the African Under-21 Championship, in both 1991 and 1999.
Like the host nation, neither the Senegalese nor Guineans have ever won the tournament before.
