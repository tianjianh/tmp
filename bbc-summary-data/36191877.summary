A petition of more than 1,000 signatures against a proposed sports and housing development near Dunblane has been submitted to Holyrood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
High-profile backers of the Â£37.5m Park of Keir scheme include Judy Murray and golfer Colin Montgomerie.
The plan for tennis and golfing facilities, and luxury homes, was turned down by Stirling Council which received more than 1,000 objections.
The developers lodged an appeal with the Scottish government in March.
The plans, which include a four-star hotel, visitor centre, museum, parkland and luxury housing, were supported by Andy and Jamie Murray as well as football legend Sir Alex Ferguson.
The petition, called "Save Park of Keir, don't let it be another Trump fiasco" has been forwarded to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
It claims there is "overwhelming public opposition" to the proposed development and there is "no evidence that this sporting complex should be at this particular Greenbelt location".
Ann Shaw, spokeswoman for the objectors, said: "Over a thousand signatures is an incredible number to collect, and we hope that the weight of our arguments will win the day."
Appeal documents submitted by the developers to the Scottish government said: "The Park of Keir proposals can be considered as both nationally and locally important, and will make a significant contribution to the local and national economy.
"The proposals will enhance and provide greater access to the natural environment, will improve the provision of sports and tourism facilities, and create a significant new recreational facility which provides local community well-being, health and quality of life benefits."
A Scottish government reporter is expected to issue a decision at a later date following a site inspection.
