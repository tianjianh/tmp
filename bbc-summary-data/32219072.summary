Masters 2015: Danny Willett goes from sheep field to Augusta

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sheffield's Danny Willett used to play his golf "in the middle of a sheep field" - now he's about to play in his first Masters.

Willett, 27, has been paired with American Larry Mize and Australian amateur Byron Meth for the first two rounds at Augusta National.
"We used to go to Anglesey in Wales for two weeks in the summer and play the same nine-hole golf course three or four times," he told BBC Radio Sheffield.
"I think the longest club you hit was probably a seven iron on this par three course in the middle of a sheep field.
"You skip it forward 17 years and you've got an invite to the Masters. It's just a bit crazy really."
Willett, who is currently ranked 51st in the world, turned professional in 2008 after winning the English Amateur championship in 2007.
He climbed into the top 50 of the rankings in December last year after winning the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa.
His group will be the second to tee off on Thursday and Willett believes that his place in the field is a reward for his perseverance.
"There's been a lot of hard work and good information. That's what being a good athlete comes down to," he said.
"A lot of people get good information but don't work hard and then they wonder why they aren't achieving what they want to.
"This is my seventh year on the Tour and in itself it is a great achievement every year to keep doing what you are doing.
"It's all going in the right direction and I've just got to keep working hard and hopefully keep getting better."
