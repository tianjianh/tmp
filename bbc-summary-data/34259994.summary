Two police officers who filmed themselves near the Shoreham air crash site could be dismissed.

Sussex Police Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney said the pair would face disciplinary proceedings over the video, which was sent on social media, and a private message.
The constables made the video while working near the scene where 11 people died after a jet crashed on to the A27.
Ms Pinkney said they had behaved in a "wholly disrespectful way".
There was sufficient evidence the officers were not likely to become "well-conducted" PCs, she said.
Ms Pinkney said the force did not punish people for making honest mistakes, but added: "In this case, I don't believe this behaviour was an honest mistake.
"Instead, it was a deliberate choice to behave in a wholly disrespectful way."
Last week, when Ms Pinkney revealed the officers had filmed themselves near the scene, she said the video was made on the cordon and did not show details of the site, but was accompanied by an inappropriate and offensive message.
Under Regulation 13, which relates to new officers in probationary periods, the pair will meet a chief officer who will make a recommendation about their future after reviewing evidence against them.
"A possible outcome is that the chief constable may decide that the officers leave the force," Ms Pinkey said.
Ms Pinkney said she apologised again to the victims' families for the unnecessary distress they had been undoubtedly caused.
