Six Nations 2016: Scotland recall Dunbar, Pyrgos & Brown

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Glasgow Warriors trio Alex Dunbar, Henry Pyrgos and Fraser Brown have been called up to the Scotland squad, but Matt Scott is an injury doubt.

Centre Scott is to have a scan to assess an elbow injury picked up in Edinburgh's defeat by Connacht.
But there is no place for London Irish duo Blair Cowan and Sean Maitland, who both withdrew from the previous squad.
Dunbar comes in as cover for Scott after proving his fitness following a thigh strain suffered in January.
Hooker Brown has played twice since his return from injury, while scrum-half Pyrgos was back in action on Sunday.
Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend hailed the performance of Pyrgos in the 27-20 win over Cardiff Blues in the Pro12.
"I thought Henry Pyrgos was outstanding," he told BBC Scotland. "To be out of the game for four months and really add tempo to our game, make the right decisions of where to attack and the players followed him and we got a couple of cracking tries in there."
Cowan and Maitland will be notable absentees from the Scotland squad that will gather on Tuesday at Murrayfield ahead of Sunday's Six Nations game against France.
Loose forward Cowan missed the victory over Italy through concussion, while winger Maitland dropped out of the squad with a thigh injury.
Both returned to London Irish for treatment but were deemed fit enough to play in the 47-20 defeat by Leicester in the English Premiership, a game that took place 24 hours after Scotland's win in Rome.
However, Scotland coach Vern Cotter has decided against recalling either player after the likes Ryan Wilson and Tim Visser, who had returned to the squad after recovering from their own injuries, took their chance to impress.
Dunbar, Pyrgos and Brown had missed the start of the tournament through injury.
Pygos, who captained Scotland for the first time last year in the absence of Greig Laidlaw, had wrist surgery after picking up his injury in October.
Brown, who takes the place of Edinburgh hooker George Turner, suffered an ankle injury at the same time.
He returned to action along with Dunbar in matches against Dragons and Cardiff.
