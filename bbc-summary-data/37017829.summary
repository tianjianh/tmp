Tom Ince had curled onto the post for the Rams, with Chris Martin forcing Anders Lindegaard into a low save and also glancing a header over.
Callum Robinson's drive was turned away for the hosts, while Eoin Doyle also went close with a volleyed effort.
The game was heading for a draw before Forsyth nodded in Will Hughes' floated cross with three minutes to go.
Derby had failed to score in both league games this season before their trip to Preston, but manager Nigel Pearson has now picked up his first league victory since taking charge of the Rams in the summer.
Joe Garner was left out of the North End squad, with boss Simon Grayson stating earlier in the week that the striker is free to join Scottish side Rangers, but Simon Makienok came on in the second-half for his debut.
Preston are now winless in eight league games in front of their own fans and have failed to pick up a point from their opening three league matches this season as they sit in the relegation places in the early Championship table.
Preston manager Simon Grayson:
"I think those who watched the game will have seen a result that was not a reflection of how the game went.We passed the ball; we defended well and caused them problems. In the second half we were the only team that was going to win it.
"We created opportunities but we couldn't get the breaks when we needed them.
"You have to feel sorry for the players, they've done everything we asked of them. There are lots of positives to take but we got a kick in the teeth.
Derby County boss Nigel Pearson:
"We needed to be disciplined and we needed to show some qualities that we didn't show at the weekend. We created chances throughout the game; we looked very promising and also very tight at the back.
"The system worked pretty well for us. Managing a team is about getting results but when things don't go plan I've got to reflect on things in a balanced way, I can't become emotional.
"We played with a lot of discipline in the midfield. If you're going to come to places like this and get results you've got to play well as a team and we did that."
