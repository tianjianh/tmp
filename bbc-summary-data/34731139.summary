[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Clare Shine scored a hat-trick as Glasgow City won the treble for the fourth year in a row by beating Hibernian in the Scottish Cup final.

Hayley Lauder fired against a Hibs post and City's pressure told when Shine finished off the underside of the crossbar before the break.
The holders hit the frame of the goal again when Erin Cuthbert's effort came back off the bar.
Shine's second and third came late on, both left-foot strikes.
Hibs miss out on a sixth tournament win, having last won the Cup in 2010 and also finished runners-up to City in the Premier League and League Cup this year.
City enjoyed most of the possession and territory amidst wet and windy conditions in Edinburgh.
Shine in particular troubled the Hibs defence and always looked the most likely to find the net.
Scotland international Lauder's long-range shot smacked the post as City's pressure built.
The opener came when Emma Brownlie was caught in possession in the right-back position and the ball ran loose to Shine, who stylishly lifted the ball over goalkeeper Jenna Fife.
As the rain lashed down in the second half, Hibs tried to force their way back into the tie with Abi Harrison's volley deflecting into the hands of City keeper Lee Alexander.
Cuthbert then rattled the crossbar for City and Lia Tweedie was next to threaten for Hibs, her downward header cleared off the line by Cuthbert.
Another effort from Cuthbert tested Fife but the second goal did arrive when Shine raced beyond the Hibs defence and finished clinically.
And it was a similar story moments later as Shine capitalised on a slip by the Hibs defence to go through and beat Fife again.
For former Stenhousemuir manager Scott Booth, it was a first Scottish Women's Cup final win as Glasgow City head coach, having replaced Eddie Wolecki Black in July.
