It is the first time that the ground has been renamed for a sponsor.
Dale, who bought the stadium outright earlier this year, groundshare with rugby league side Rochdale Hornets.
"Today is a landmark day for Rochdale and one which at times over the past 10 years I could only ever dream would happen," said chairman Chris Dunphy.
"The board of directors and I were unanimous in our decision, which we believe will bolster our future sustainability and are extremely proud to announce them as our major commercial partner."
