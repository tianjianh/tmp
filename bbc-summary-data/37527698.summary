[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jordan Maguire-Drew nearly put the Daggers in front early on when he struck the woodwork while at the other end, Ryan Bird did the same with a header as the sides sparred.
In the second half, Matt Robinson threaded a through-pass to Whitely, who controlled and dispatched under Ryan Clarke with the confidence of a striker - a goal that ended an impressive 10-match unbeaten run for the hosts.
Whitely could have put a greater gloss on matters for John Still's side, but he struck the bar from 20 yards.
