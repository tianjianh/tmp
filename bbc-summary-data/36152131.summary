[SN]TITLE[SN]
Northampton Town loan: Bid to stop house sale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Northampton Borough Council is seeking an interim injunction to stop the sale of a house owned by the wife of the ex-chairman of the town's football club.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council is trying to claw back a Â£10.25m loan to Northampton Town, made to help the club develop its Sixfields Stadium.
In a statement the council said it had applied to prevent the sale of Christina Cardoza's house.
She is the wife of David Cardoza, a former club chairman and director.
The council said in a statement: "We have taken this action against the Cardozas as part of our pursuit of the Â£10.25m loan made by Northampton Borough Council to Northampton Town Football Club.
"The borough council took on the right to pursue the debt from the football club under the memorandum of understanding signed with the club's new owners and we have made it clear that we do intend to take the action needed both to find out what happened and to recover the public money that has not been repaid."
A meeting earlier at the District Registry of the High Court in Birmingham adjourned the case until a hearing on 20 May.
Mr Cardoza has yet to comment.
