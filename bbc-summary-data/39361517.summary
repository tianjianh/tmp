Edge Hill University students Owen Lambert and Travis Frain, were hit as a car drove along the pavement on Westminster Bridge as the attack began.
Mr Frain is having surgery to his leg, the university said.
University Pro Vice Chancellor Lynda Brady said of the remaining 12 students, three were back home and nine others were returning.
They were part of a group of 13 students - with a lecturer - on a visit to the Houses of Parliament.
Mr Lambert, 18, from Morecambe, is understood to have required stitches to a head wound. Two other students needed treatment for lesser injuries.
Quoted in the Lancaster Guardian, Mr Lambert said he was "battered and bruised, but doing fine".
He also thanked police and hospital staff "for helping me through this ordeal".
Dr John Cater, vice chancellor of the university, told BBC North West Tonight the students were on the first day of a two-day visit to London. They had been inside the House of Commons watching Prime Minister's Questions two hours before the attack.
He added: "Our assumption is that they were either knocked over by other people or struck by the vehicle.
"Obviously all of them will be somewhat traumatised by what they have seen."
