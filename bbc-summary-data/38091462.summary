Paul Trollope: Brighton name former Cardiff boss as assistant manager

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brighton & Hove Albion have appointed former Cardiff City head coach Paul Trollope as assistant to manager Chris Hughton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Trollope, 44, was sacked by the Bluebirds last month after less than five months in charge.
He was part of Wales' coaching set-up at Euro 2016 and previously worked with Hughton at Birmingham and Norwich.
He replaces Colin Calderwood, who left the Seagulls to join Championship rivals Aston Villa earlier this week.
"I'm delighted to be working with Paul again," Hughton said.
"He's an excellent coach, and since his time with me he's gone on to gain great experience at international level with Wales and in club management with Cardiff."
