The striker, who is now the division's joint-leading scorer, put the Bees in front before goals from David Tutonda and Curtis Weston wrapped up the win, prior to Craig Disley's consolation.
Barnet went ahead when Akinde beat Mariners goalkeeper James McKeown with a looping header following a long ball into the box by defender Michael Nelson.
The hosts came close to a second when Jamal Campbell-Ryce's cross-shot struck the crossbar.
Defender Tutonda doubled the Bees' advantage five minutes before the break, volleying home his first goal for the club following a one-two with Weston.
Weston sealed the three points after the interval when he tapped home a rebound from close range.
Grimsby rarely threatened the home side, but they did manage to get on the scoresheet with 16 minutes remaining.
Barnet goalkeeper Josh Vickers failed to deal with a corner into the box and midfielder Disley pounced.
