Guided by five radars, four lasers and 12 cameras, a converted electric Nissan Leaf has been following a mapped route around Beckton, in east London.
It is aware of pedestrians and knows when to stop at red lights - with an attentive human behind the wheel in case of emergency.
The software is still learning but Nissan hopes the cars could be available by 2020.
