Up to 20,000 runners will join elite athletes including Farah to take part in the 13.1m (21m) route on Easter Saturday, 26 March.
The world champion runner said the "famous, flat and fast Cardiff course" would make for an "exciting" race.
Registration for the event closes on 29 February.
Farah, who is the event's official ambassador, said: "It's going to be great to have so many people running in the mass race and hopefully I'll get chance to meet a lot of people and cheer them on as well - because a half marathon is a great achievement."
The 32-year-old has made himself available for selection for the Great Britain and Northern Ireland team and he is aiming to become the first male British winner in the event's 24-year history.
Cardiff will become the fourth UK city to host the world half marathon event on the same course used for last year's Cardiff half marathon.
More than 50,000 spectators are expected to attend and it will be shown live on BBC TV.
