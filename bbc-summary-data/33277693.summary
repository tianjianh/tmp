New Stranraer slipway is 'virtually useless'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Local authority officials have been accused of ignoring councillors' plans for Stranraer's waterfront regeneration programme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Some claim it has left a new slipway at the town's harbour "virtually useless".
Elected members clashed on the issue during a meeting of Dumfries and Galloway Council on Thursday.
Earlier this week an internal investigation found "no illegality, maladministration or injustice" in handling part of the scheme.
Grahame Forster, councillor for Wigtown West, said: "The committee approved a large slipway. We were delivered a small slipway that neither reaches the sea or is large enough to take boats out.
"Officers decided to come up with the idea of a small slipway with a boat hoist, not elected members initially."
He said local fishermen have not been properly consulted on the position of the boat hoist.
Fellow councillor Willie Scobie, who represents Stranraer, said their points were ignored by members at the meeting of the full council.
He added: "They have ignored the people of Stranraer throughout the whole process."
Council monitoring officer Alex Haswell has investigated the project and concluded there was a "clear audit trail" of decisions and delegated powers had not been exceeded.
An external report has been ordered to look at the financial viability of the slipway scheme and whether it provides value for money.
