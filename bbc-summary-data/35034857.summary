[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new scheme that will put pharmacists in GP practices has been launched.

It is hoped having drugs experts on hand will ease the burden on doctors and allow for better management of some chronic conditions.
It means in future, pharmacists will do more advising and prescribing of medicines.
Some pharmacists already work out of GP practices, but it is not widespread and the Department of Health thinks it should be.
An investment of Â£2.6m will create 45 new pharmacy posts next year  and the department says it will fund over 200 more by 2020.
"With the growth in our elderly population and more people living with multiple conditions, prescribing medications is becoming increasingly complex," Health Minister Simon Hamilton said.
"We have a great resource in our pharmacists whom we want to better utilise to work directly alongside GPs and nurses.
"Not only will this approach deliver a better service for patients, it is also common sense to ensure we make the most effective use of the skills and experience we have in health and social care.
"Critically, having a pharmacist as part of the clinical team within a practice can also relieve work pressure on GPs, freeing up time for the GP to spend with patients with more complex medical needs, helping to make appointments at GP surgeries easier to get and improving the quality and safety of our prescribing for better patient outcomes."
