The woman was taken to Borders General Hospital where she later died. The occupants of the van were not hurt.
Police Scotland have appealed for witnesses to come forward.
In a separate incident, a 43-year-old motorcyclist suffered serious injuries in a crash involving his Suzuki and a Fiat car on the A707 Selkirk to Caddonfoot road, near Linglie Farm.
The two female occupants of the Fiat suffered minor injuries in the crash, which happened at about 11:20 on Friday.
They were taken to Borders General Hospital but later discharged.
Sgt Neil Inglis, of the Divisional Road Policing Unit at Galashiels, said: "Tragically a woman has died following the collision near Philiphaugh.
"These were two serious but unrelated incidents which occurred within a short space of time and less than two miles apart.
"I would ask any members of the public who may have witnessed these collisions or these vehicles prior to the collisions to come forward if they have not already done so."
