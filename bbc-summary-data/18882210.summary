New schools planned in Flintshire in education shake-up

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new high school and primary may be built in Flintshire under revised proposals for restructuring education in the county.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The schools would be built in Holywell, while in Deeside and in Mold, some post-16 education would move.
Original plans for schools in Deeside, Buckley and Mynydd Isa proved unpopular among parents when they were first put forward, leading to a rethink.
Flintshire council plans to consult on the new proposals this autumn.
The changes to schools aims to cut the number of vacant places to reduce building sizes and costs.
On Tuesday, the council's cabinet agreed a plan:
A  
          report to the cabinet committee
 says the changes at Elfed school would "free up space [at Elfed] which could be used for other things not connected to the school like office space".
Part of the school already includes the town's public swimming baths and leisure centre.
The council says it hopes to make a final decision on the plans by the summer of 2013 after the consultation.
School reorganisation plans were first discussed last summer with Flintshire council saying there were three high schools - Holywell, Elfed in Buckley and John Summers in Queensferry - where surplus places were now over 25%.
Initially, options included merging Argoed High, Mynydd, with Elfed High and consolidating Deeside's John Summers High with Connah's Quay High.
But the plans prompted protests from parents and were dropped.
