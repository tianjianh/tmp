Police have made an urgent appeal to her mother to get in touch. The baby is safe and well.
The baby was found inside the disabled toilets at Silcock's Amusement Arcade on Neville Street, at about 19:00 on Thursday.
It is thought the birth was unsupervised and there is concern for the mother's health.
The child is being looked after at Ormskirk Hospital, where staff have named her April.
Merseyside Police said the mother may need medical help.
The force has released a CCTV image of a woman - believed to be the mother - who they are trying to trace.
Det Insp Mike Dalton, said: "Our primary concern is for the health of the girl's mother. She is not in any trouble.
"I would urge April's mother to urgently come forward or at least seek treatment, as she could suffer medical complications, which are potentially very dangerous."
A 24-hour phone line has been set up by the hospital in order for the mother to make contact.
