[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luke Sandlan, 27, and 21-year-old Elliott, from Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to assaulting the man at the Pier Jam event in September.
The 23-year-old victim suffered a cardiac arrest after being stabbed 14 times but survived the attack.
Luke Sandlan was jailed for 11 years, and his brother was given a seven-and-a-half year sentence.
Passing sentence, Judge Mark Brown QC described the incident as a "sustained and ferocious assault".
The attack took place at the Sunset Bar on North Shore, where the younger sibling set off a fire extinguisher, before his brother lunged at the victim with a knife bought earlier in the day.
Luke Sandlan, from Eccles, pleaded guilty to attempted murder and possession of an offensive weapon. He also had an 18-week suspended sentence activated.
Elliott Sandlan, who admitted to wounding with intent, was also given an additional two years for supplying Class A drugs to an undercover officer.
