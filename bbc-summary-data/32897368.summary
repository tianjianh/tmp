Among them was an Action Man judo kit, believed to be one of only two in such pristine condition, which fetched £5,400.
It belonged to 88-year-old Doug Carpenter, a former salesman for toy firm Palitoy, who had kept scores of boxes in his loft for decades.
The items went under the hammer at Vectis Auctions in Thornaby, Teesside.
The judo kit, dating from 1969 or 1970, was originally sold for 12 shillings (about 60p) and had a guide price of £4,000-£6,000.
