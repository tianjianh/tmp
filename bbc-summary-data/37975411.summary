A spokesman for the Staffordshire theme park said the move was "part of Alton Towers' continued recovery".
The resort employs 800 full-time staff and an additional 1,500 seasonal workers.
Park operator Merlin Attractions was fined £5m in September over the crash, in which 16 people were injured.
The company said salaried staff will face redundancy. Consultation is under way and the jobs will go ahead of the 2017 season.

An Alton Towers spokeswoman said: "As part of Alton Towers' continued recovery we have been looking at ways to improve our operating model.
"A detailed review of operations has been undertaken across the business to seek further efficiencies and increase flexibility.
"As a result of this review, Alton Towers Resort can confirm that it expects to make between 60-70 redundancies ahead of the 2017 season."
She added: "This was an incredibly difficult proposal to make and it has not been taken lightly.
Merlin has seen a £14m drop in revenue this year as a result of the crash.
Teenagers Vicky Balch, then 19, and Leah Washington, then 17, needed leg amputations when the ride collided at 90mph with an empty carriage, 20ft (6m) above ground.
The park is currently closed for this season and will reopen in March next year.
The Smiler reopened earlier this year.
