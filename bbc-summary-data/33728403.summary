Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood denies party split

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has denied reports of a split in the party following concern about its former leader's criticism of leadership and policy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas faces internal disciplinary action for questioning Plaid's election campaign priorities.
But he won the backing of his local group members at a meeting on Tuesday.
Ms Wood said there had been disagreements with one AM but she "would not call that a split".
Speaking at a meet-the-public event in Colwyn Bay, Conwy, on Thursday she said: "I don't accept there are divisions in Plaid Cymru."
Following Tuesday's meeting to discuss Lord Elis-Thomas's future, one party member said that while the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency party members had voted in his favour, the AM would "have to make compromises".
The meeting was called following his criticism of Ms Wood's leadership over the past few months.
The assembly's former presiding officer, who led Plaid Cymru from 1984 to 1991, had attacked his party's main general election demand that Wales should be treated in the same way as Scotland.
He claimed the campaign did not focus on Wales' future and criticised Ms Wood's spring party conference speech in which she said a vote for UKIP was a "vote against Wales".
Lord Elis-Thomas has already been chosen as the Plaid candidate to defend his Dwyfor Meirionnydd seat in next year's assembly election, but could face de-selection as the ultimate sanction in the disciplinary process.
