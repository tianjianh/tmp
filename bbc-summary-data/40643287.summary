Stewart Russell, who owns the farm near Lundin Links, was approaching a private runway in his two-seater plane at about 11:00 when it  flipped on to its roof.
The 75-year-old pilot was taken to Ninewells hospital in Dundee.
His brother George said he was left battered, bruised and badly shaken.
He told BBC Scotland: "My brother Stewart was coming in to land, it's a nice sunny day so ideal conditions.
"He came down and had to avoid a combine harvester sitting close to the runway and the wing tip hit the combine and it rolled over a few times.
"He's badly bruised and shaken but hopefully he will be OK."
The pilot's injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
An investigation into the crash is under way with a specialist crane being sent from East Kilbride to move the wreckage.
A police cordon was put in place around the site.
