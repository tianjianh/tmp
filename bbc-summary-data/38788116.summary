An appeal to raise funds for a Glasgow vet caught up in the American flight ban has raised enough to pay for her tickets home just a few hours after being launched.

Hamaseh Tayari was told she could not fly from Costa Rica via New York as she travels on an Iranian passport.
Airline officials at San Jose airport also told her that her transit visa for the US was no longer valid.
She and her boyfriend had to book Â£2,600 flights via Madrid and London.
Dr Tayari told BBC Radio Scotland that the cost of the flights would leave the couple without money for food, rent and bills for the next few months.
But a crowdfunding appeal, launched by Women for Independence on Saturday evening, has already raised more than Â£5,000.
On hearing that enough money had been raised to cover the flights, Dr Tayari said: "This is amazing."
On Sunday morning she posted a picture on Facebook from Costa Rica airport in front of a sign which said "avoid being punished".
On the post, she wrote: "Still waiting at San Jose (Costa Rica) airport to fly to Madrid. At least far from the USA chaos. We fell (sic) tired, but not alone! Thanks for all the support, and love people!"
Dr Tayari was prevented from flying to the US under President Donald Trump's executive order barring people from several Muslim countries.
The American president said the measures would "keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the US".
The 90-day travel ban affects nationals from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
Speaking to BBC Scotland from San Jose airport in Costa Rica on Saturday night, Dr Tayari, who works at the University of Glasgow, said: "We arrived at the airport this morning at five o'clock for the check-in to fly to New York, and then from New York to Glasgow.
"The people at the check-in told me that I was not allowed to take the plane because of the new rules."
Dr Tayari grew up and studied in Italy, qualifying as a vet in 2012.
She was awarded a PhD by the University of Pisa after a short period of extra training in Switzerland and moved to Glasgow to continue her studies in November 2015.
She said: "I still have Iranian nationality, because I've never thought about changing it.
"I've never had any problems until now, maybe I've had to wait a bit longer for visas, but nothing like this has happened to me."
A Scottish government spokesperson said: "The Scottish government is closely monitoring the situation and we have made contact with the UK government to raise the case.
"We stand ready to offer whatever assistance we can to Ms Tayari or her family at this difficult time."
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: "We were extremely concerned at the difficulties which one of our postgraduate students encountered on trying to return to the UK via the United States after holidaying in Costa Rica.
"We have been in touch with Hamaseh who has made arrangements to get back to Glasgow via an alternative route. The university will do all that we can to support her."
