Oxford United chairman Darryl Eales has confirmed plans for a temporary stand at the open end of the Kassam Stadium remain on the agenda.

Club owner Eales is keen on a larger than originally planned structure with more than 700 seats.
Oxford are expecting to have a capacity crowd when they face neighbours Swindon Town in League One on 10 September.
"I would anticipate seeing it in place by then, but watch this space," Eales told BBC Radio Oxford.
Oxford United became tenants at the three-sided 12,500 capacity ground in 2001 after leaving their previous Manor Ground home.
The stadium has also previously hosted rugby union, with London Welsh tenants for three seasons until 2015.
A temporary stand would be subject to planning approval from Oxford City Council, who have previously stated their support.
"Once we're good to go, the practicalities of erecting it are straightforward," Eales added.
"You can actually put it up in two to three days. We're trying to get planning permission and (stadium owner and former Oxford United owner) Firoz Kassam is being helpful in that regard.
"But a deal is only done when it's signed, so let's not get carried away. But I think we're making good progress."
