Ex Scientia founder and CEO Prof Andrew Hopkins added: "We are delighted to collaborate with Sunovion on this exciting approach to discovering new treatments for complex psychiatric diseases.
"The agreement shows the power of applying a polypharmacology philosophy to challenging disease areas and our commitment to building strategic partnerships with major pharmaceutical companies to deliver novel medicines."
Under the terms of the agreement, Sunovion will receive worldwide rights to any compounds developed, while Ex Scientia will retain exclusive rights to the technology.
