Carlos Tevez will resume his Manchester City career despite accusing Roberto Mancini of treating him "like a dog" in the incident that sparked their rift.

Tevez is to return to Manchester from Argentina, where he has been without City's permission since 7 November.
The Argentine has not played since boss Mancini accused him of refusing to come on against Bayern Munich in September.
He claimed Mancini insulted him but on Monday he said: "I am ready to return, to win and do the best for the club."
The club are expecting him to report to their Carrington training ground for fitness tests and Mancini, who initially said Tevez was "finished" at City, says he could now feature in the title run-in.
But it remains to be seen how City will respond to some of Tevez's comments in Monday's lengthy interview with Argentine broadcaster Fox Sports.
"I can imagine myself going on to the field and I'm going to have to be brilliant [to win over the critics]," he added. "It's not going to be easy for me nor the fans.
"If I was wrong, I say sorry. I sincerely believe I did not make a mistake. If it's true [Mancini would welcome me back], of course I like that, if it's for the media, no."
Recounting the circumstances that led to him remaining on the substitutes bench during City's 2-0 defeat in Munich, the 28-year-old Argentina striker heavily criticised Mancini.
"I was kind of in a bad mood and when he brings on [Nigel] de Jong and takes off [Edin] Dzeko, and we're losing 2-0, I thought it was a defensive substitution so I decided to sit back on the bench," he said.
"At the same time Dzeko comes off and is really angry and has a go at Mancini. He then sees the tunnel is closed so he has to sit down next to him and they start to have an argument.
"Dzeko was speaking Bosnian and Mancini would swear at him in Italian so it was a real mess. So I go and sit down and he doesn't see me because he's having this discussion. But then he turns around and sees me and you can imagine what happens.
"He's in the middle of an argument so then he tells me to keep on warming up and treats me like a dog.
"So when he spoke to me in that tone of voice, and I said 'No, I'm not going out'. So I was willing to play, but the coach was in such a foul mood because he had that argument with Dzeko.
"He started on me as well, started swearing at me, that was him, because I was very calm. Mancini said some  horrible things to me."
City fined Tevez £1.2m for refusing to return from South America and they have not paid his £200,000-a-week salary since he has been there.
He was linked with moves to Inter Milan, AC Milan and Paris St Germain during the transfer window but nothing materialised.
Tevez, who is under contract until July 2014, accepts not all City fans will welcome his return but has adopted a conciliatory approach.
"I believe they were misinformed, they weren't told the facts," he said. "So that when they were told I didn't want to play they naturally turned against me.
"If a player doesn't want to play for the team that's paying his wages it's only natural for them to turn against that player.
"And I couldn't understand what was going on. I swore like any player would. I gave everything to that club and when I saw them burning my shirt with my name on it or hurling insults at me it really hurt. I gave everything to that club and what I love above all is to play football."
