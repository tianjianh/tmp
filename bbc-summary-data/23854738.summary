A bronze statue of Roma Jones and her sister Emma, with their sons Kyan Ishann Jones and Shaye-Jones Amin, will be put up in Centenary Square.
It is part of a three-year project by Turner Prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing and the Ikon gallery to find out what it means to be a family.
A campaign to raise £100,000 to build the statue has started.
The family said: "We feel truly amazed and honoured to be chosen to represent what it means to be a family in Birmingham.
"We feel it highlights that family is an indestructible bond between people that is universal and it doesn't matter how it is made up or what it looks like."
They were chosen from a shortlist of four families by a panel of nine judges.
Stuart Tulloch from the Ikon gallery said it was a "unanimous decision" to select them.
"Their story is compelling and says much about contemporary Birmingham: two mixed-race sisters, both single-parents with happy, lively young boys, who identify themselves strongly with the city of their birth.
"The bronze sculpture will take its place in Centenary Square near statues of kings and industrial pioneers.
"In-so-doing, we draw attention to the everyday and the unsung, a lasting memorial to the people of Birmingham who are the life-blood of our city."
