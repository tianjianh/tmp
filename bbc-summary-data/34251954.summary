Rugby World Cup 2015: Eli Walker out of Wales squad

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wing Eli Walker has pulled out of Wales' World Cup squad because of a hamstring injury.

The once-capped Ospreys player, 23, was himself a late call-up after full-back Leigh Halfpenny was ruled out with a knee injury.
It comes after scrum-half Rhys Webb's earlier withdrawal.
Twice-capped Gloucester back-rower Ross Moriarty, 21, who has taken Walker's place, tweeted: "Feel for @EliWalker24 having to miss out because of injury."
He added: "Unbelievably thankful to be given a call-up and can't wait to get back involved."
Walker's withdrawal leaves Wales with three specialist wings in Hallam Amos, Alex Cuthbert and George North, while Bristol fly-half Matthew Morgan can also play there.
Moriarty is now set to follow in the footsteps of his father Paul and uncle Richard, who played for Wales at the inaugural 1987 event.
Wales' back-row pool has increased to six with Moriarty able to cover number eight as well as blindside flanker.
Former Wales wing Adrian Hadley, a 1987 team-mate of Paul and Richard Moriarty, is worried the squad reshuffle has left Wales "light" at the back.
And although Hadley understands why Wales coach Warren Gatland might want an extra back-row to choose from, Wales are "short of cover" out wide.
"They've had time to reflect on the selection that they've made and I think if you're going into three massive games with England, Fiji and Australia with probably five back-rowers you're probably better off with a sixth one there just in case.
"And Ross Moriarty impressed every time he's played."
But Hadley added: "The worry for meâ€¦ is the form of Alex Cuthbert.
"He's just not been performing as he was when he first came into the Welsh team and that is a big, big worry and you would have thought Eli Walker would have been really pushing him for that position."
Warren Gatland's side host minnows Uruguay in their tournament opener in Cardiff on Sunday, 20 September.
Games against England, Fiji and Australia follow in Pool A.
