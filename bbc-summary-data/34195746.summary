Strabane bridge: Council 'held to ransom' over name

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sinn Féin have said that Derry and Strabane District Council is being "held to ransom" by the social development minister over the naming of a new footbridge in Strabane.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors have been given 30 days to come up with a new name or risk losing £1m pounds of government funding.
Sinn Féin proposed the bridge be called after their late colleague Ivan Barr.
Minister Mervyn Storey said it cannot be named after anyone with political party affiliations.
A row between the Department for Social Development and council erupted in February when Mr Storey asked for a shortlist of possible names for the bridge.
Sinn Féin's majority was enough to ensure that the shortlist consisted of a single name.
Sinn Féin councillor Karina Carlin said the minister was holding the council to ransom.
"He is using his ministerial position to attempt to try to hold the council to ransom over, for him, what seems to be a very party political position that he's adopted," she said.
"He has done so in contravention of the democratically expressed will on no less than four occasions.
"This is not his money this is departmental money, this is your taxes and my taxes.
"This project was earmarked for a very long time and championed by the late Ivan Barr."
Ulster Unionist  councillor Derek Hussey said it has always been clear that the department reserves the right to approve the name.
"The agreement at the beginning was that approval would be from the department, whatever minister happened to be sitting there," he said.
"All parties signed up to that when they said yes, great, lets have that money.
"Now there are some who wish to renege on that initial agreement where the minister would have the final say."
A spokesperson for the Department for Social Development said: "Mervyn Storey has given the council 30 days to come up with alternative proposals for the name of the bridge and he was under no obligation to provide more than £1m in grant funding if alternative proposals were not made."
