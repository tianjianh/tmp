Downpours and high winds on Thursday caused problems on the roads and the rail network.
Whitesands in Dumfries flooded for the second time in a week and about 500 homes in the region lost power after a lightning strike.
The Met Office has issued yellow "be prepared" warnings for further heavy rain over the weekend.
They cover south west Scotland, Lothian and Borders and the Strathclyde area.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) had just one flood alert still in place on Friday - for west central Scotland.

On Thursday, a landslip caused by heavy rain in the Thornhill area closed the rail line between Kilmarnock and Dumfries.
Disruption to services was expected to continue until 13:00 on Friday.
Elsewhere, 2,000 sandbags were brought in by Perth and Kinross Council to replenish stocks after floods hit the Perthshire village of Comrie, near Crieff, on Monday.
Fire crews piled sandbags next to the river bank to prevent further flooding and specialist water rescue teams pumped out drains.
In the Borders, several streets in Galashiels flooded. The council was forced to close roads and provide extra sandbags.
Dumfries and Galloway Council said flooding at the Whitesands peaked between 20:00 and 21:00 on Thursday night.
The waters extended from the foot of Friars Vennel through Brewery Street along the car park to the bottom of Bank Street.
The council said its out-of-hours standby arrangements were being put in place to cope with any further problems over the weekend.
