[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Terry began his 50-year broadcasting career with Irish state broadcaster RTE before joining the BBC in 1966.
Sir Terry was a hugely popular radio presenter, especially for BBC Radio 2's breakfast programme.
Listeners loved his wit, warm tone and unmatched humour. Among the guests he welcomed onto the show was the late US actor Larry Hagman.
He also found great success with television programmes such as comedy game show Blankety Blank, which he hosted from 1979 to 1983.
Sir Terry married his wife Helen in 1965. The couple are pictured below with their baby daughter Katherine and their sons Alan, 5 (right), and Mark, 2, in 1972.
He was one of the most familiar figures in British broadcasting for decades.
Among the high profile people he met was Diana, Princess of Wales, pictured here in 1997.
During his many years in entertainment, Sir Terry had classic encounters with the likes of comedians Kenny Everett (right) and Ernie Wise (right). TV presenter Frank Bough (in the middle) was also among his contemporaries.
He welcomed celebrities such as singer Rod Stewart on to his chat show, Wogan.
Sir Terry was a keen golfer, appearing below with comedian Jimmy Tarbuck and American pop singer Johnny Mathis during the Bob Hope British Classic golf tournament in 1981.
Sir Terry played a leading role in raising hundreds of millions of pounds for children's charities. He anchored the BBC's charity appeal, Children in Need, from its launch in 1980, and he continued to host the programme after his retirement from regular broadcasting.
He is pictured below with Alesha Dixon and Tess Daly in 2009.
He also was also closely involved with the BBC's television coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest for many years.
He commentated for the first time in 1973. But only presented the contest once, in 1998, with Ulrika Jonsson.
Sir Terry was given a knighthood in 2005. He collected the title at Buckingham Palace accompanied by his wife, Lady Wogan.
