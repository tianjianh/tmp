[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gordon Coventry, 52, must spend a minimum of 20 years in jail for killing Mr Adie in Tweed Avenue, Kirkcaldy, on Saturday 28 May 2016.
Mr Adie was found unconscious in the street and he died later the same day in the Victoria Hospital.
Coventry was convicted at the High Court in Dunfermline on Monday.
Det Ch Insp Raymond Brown said: "The investigation into Darren's murder was complex and Gordon Coventry's efforts to evade justice caused the family unnecessary additional suffering.
"However, due to the diligence, skill and professionalism of the officers involved in the inquiry, coupled with the support and assistance from the local community, we were able to identify him as being responsible through protracted and detailed investigations.
"My thoughts today are with Darren's family and friends who had to endure the most tragic of circumstances.
"I would like to thank them for their support during the investigation and although nothing can ever undo the wicked actions of Coventry, I hope this verdict brings them some sense of comfort."
