Jim Leishman elected as Fife's provost

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Dunfermline Athletic football manager Jim Leishman has been named as Fife Council's new provost.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Leishman was elected as a Labour councillor for Dunfermline on 3 May.
His nomination was proposed by the party at the first full meeting of the council on Thursday morning, and he was elected provost by 42 votes to 35.
Mr Leishman said: "This is one of the proudest days of my life. Fife's been good to me, and now is a chance to pay something back."
He added: "It is a deep honour to be elected as provost and I will work hard for all the people right across the Kingdom of Fife."
Labour has formed a minority administration in Fife.
Mr Leishman became manager of the Pars in 1982 when they were languishing in the bottom tier of the Scottish football League. He was only 28 years old at the time.
He became a Dunfermline legend after taking the club to the Premier League just five years later, and became famous for his flamboyant personality, "aeroplane" celebration and national television appearances, when he often recited humorous poems about football.
He left Dunfermline in controversial circumstances in 1990 before returning as general manger in 2003 following stints at Montrose and Livingston.
Mr Leishman briefly returned to the East End Park dugout two years later, before moving back upstairs, initially as general manager and then as director of football - a post he still holds.
