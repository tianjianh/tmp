Mr Jones, from Newport, has been awarded a British Empire Medal while Malcolm Walker, founder of Wales-based food store Iceland, has been knighted.
Former Welsh Assembly chief executive Claire Clancy has been made a dame.
Hilary Boulding, ex-principal of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, is also given the title.
Former AM Peter Black becomes a CBE.
Harry Potter author JK Rowling, who went to comprehensive school in Chepstow, and celebrity chef Delia Smith, whose mother is Welsh, are awarded the Companion of Honour.
Mr Jones, from Bassaleg, was captured during the Second World War in the Middle East before arriving at Auschwitz in October 1943. There he was held in a prisoner of war camp.
He has sold poppies for 30 years and is chairman of the Royal British Legion's Bassaleg and Rhiwderin branch.
"I haven't a clue why I've been nominated, my poppy selling I expect," he said.
"I've done it for about 30 years, for two weeks a year. I've got nothing to do so sometimes I'm there selling all day.
"It takes me back to my days in the army and is my way of doing my bit. I'll go again this year if someone takes me, as long as I'm fit."
Former Liberal Democrat AM, the former deputy minister in the assembly, and current Swansea councillor Mr Black receives a CBE for services to politics and public life in Wales.
Former Wales football international and Cardiff City Ladies manager Michele Adams has been awarded an MBE for her services to girls' and women's football in Wales.
"Seeing the youngsters you've helped coach reach the dizzy heights along the way is excellent," said the 59-year-old, who won five Welsh Cups during her record-breaking reign at Cardiff.
As Wales Under-19 girls coach, Miss Adams also helped nurture current Wales internationals Jess Fishlock, Tash Harding and Sophie Ingle.
"To know you have been part of their success story is great," she added. "This is the highlight but it is very much for them as well as it is for me."
Major Denis Burton, band master for the Regimental Band and Corps of Drums of The Royal Welsh, has been appointed an MBE.
The Pontypridd musician leads the armed forces band around the pitch before Wales' Six Nations games.
