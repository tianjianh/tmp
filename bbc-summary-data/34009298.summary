A family from Barnsley who were caught up in the Tunisia beach attacks have claimed they have had no help from the government.

Maxine Midgley, Richard Slater and their 14-year-old daughter Bronwyn hid in a shopkeeper's cupboard in Sousse as people were being killed around them.
Ms Midgley described the lack of official support as "disgusting".
Tobias Ellwood MP, for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said the family "should be getting help".
The family said they were suffering from flashbacks and other psychological problems.
"I had heard that David Cameron was supposed to be helping everybody for counselling and things like this," she said.
"As far as I'm concerned, we've had nothing. They've not even asked to see we were OK."
President of the UK Psychological Trauma Society, Prof Neil Greenberg, believes people involved in the Tunisia attacks who need mental health care are falling through the net because a proper system has not been established to support them.
He has called for the introduction of a screen and treat programme - a system used after the 7/7 bombings - to identify victims in need of specialist help.
The government says its doing all it can to help those affected.
Mr Slater said he had contacted the family's GP after his partner suffered a "meltdown" and started to smash things in the family's home.
He said: "The GPs have been OK and tried to support us as best they can, but they're not counsellors."
Eventually, Mr Slater's employers arranged and paid for counselling sessions for him and his family.
"I wake up most nights sweating and thinking about what really happened and just how close we were," he said.
"It's horrendous really, it's a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone.
"I have it all, running from the beach up to the street having to keep Maxine and Bronwyn in front of me so if any bullets come I take the bullet.
"Then we were in that cupboard with hand grenades and bullets going off in front of us."
Mr Ellwood, under secretary of state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said his department had "mobilised a huge amount of government help".
He said he was "disturbed to hear" the family was having to seek private finance for help and urged them to get in touch with the Sousse families' unit at the Foreign Office.
Thirty-eight people, including 30 Britons, were killed when gunman Seifeddine Rezgui opened fire on tourists staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui on 26 June.
