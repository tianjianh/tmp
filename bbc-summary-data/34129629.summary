Viridor launches £25m glass recycling plant at Newhouse

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Recycling firm Viridor has launched its new £25m glass recycling plant in North Lanarkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 70,000 sq ft facility at Newhouse will recycle material from 17 Scottish local authorities.
It is hoped the new plant will reduce the need for industries such as Scotch whisky to import glass.
A total of 30 jobs have been created at the recycling centre, which will have the capacity to recycle 200,000 tonnes of glass every year.

Julie Hesketh-Laird, from the Scotch Whisky Association, said: "The opening of Newhouse assists the Scotch whisky industry by increasing the availability of high-quality recycled glass.
"As glass accounts for the vast majority of the packaging of Scotch we welcome this supply chain innovation at Newhouse which advances glass recycling.
"Such developments help the industry in its commitment to sustainability and delivering on its environmental strategy."
Opening the new plant, Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: "I welcome this significant investment in modern recycling infrastructure.
"Glass packaging is important to a number of Scottish food and drinks manufacturers and glass recycling makes sense for our economy and the environment."
The Newhouse plant is part of a £357m recycling and renewable energy investment package announced by Viridor in Scotland over the last 18 months.
Projects include a £177.4m Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) at Oxwellmains in East Lothian and a £154m Glasgow Recycling and Renewable Energy Centre.
