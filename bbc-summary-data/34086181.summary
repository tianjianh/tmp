Radical preacher Anjem Choudary to stand trial on terror charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Radical preacher Anjem Choudary is set to stand trial next year for allegedly encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 48-year-old, from Ilford, east London, is charged with inviting support for the banned group on social media from June 2014 to March 2015.
He is being held on remand in prison and appeared in front of a packed Old Bailey public gallery via videolink.
A plea hearing will take place before the trial begins on 11 January.
Mohammed Rahman, 32, of Whitechapel, east London, is accused of the same charges.
Both men are charged with one offence under section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, alleged to have taken place between 29 June 2014 and 6 March this year.
They previously indicated they would be pleading not guilty.
Mr Choudary and Mr Rahman appeared before Mr Justice Saunders for their first Crown Court hearing.
Dressed in a white robe, Mr Choudary spoke only to confirm his name and was represented by lawyer Blinne Ghralaigh.
His co-accused wore a striped T-shirt and khaki trousers and was also represented.
The judge set a plea and case management hearing for 11 December.
The trial - which will take place at an as yet undecided court in London - is scheduled to last between three and four weeks.
