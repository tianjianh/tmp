[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
There are just four public toilets in Flintshire, a survey has revealed - one for roughly every 38,000 residents.

The Great British Public Toilet Map has charted the number of publicly accessible toilets across the UK to coincide with World Toilet day.
Flintshire came bottom of the survey, along with five other councils.
Critics argued this is a "public health issue," but the council said it promotes toilets in places like libraries.
The survey said that Darlington, Melton, North Kesteven, Redditch and South Ribble also have just four public toilets each.
In January, Flintshire council proposed closing or offloading the facilities in a bid to save up to Â£94,000.
The Welsh Government recently tabled plans to ensure every Welsh local authority has a "public toilet strategy".
Gail Ramster at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design, who created the toilet map, said: "Our public toilet analysis can help campaigners to reveal whether their council is underperforming compared to others with similar demographics, geography and industry."
A spokesman from Crohn's and Colitis UK said reducing access to toilets for those in need was "having a major impact on people with incontinence, and is a public health issue".
In response, a Flintshire council spokesman said that a review of its public toilets earlier in the year showed they "regularly attract antisocial behaviour" which deterred people from using them.
"It was therefore proposed that the council should promote the use of its existing toilet facilities within other publically accessible council buildings e.g. libraries, leisure centres and Flintshire Connects Centres," he said.
The data analysis, supported by the Open Data Institute, draws upon data collected by crowdsourcing, open data from councils on toilet provision and FOI requests.
