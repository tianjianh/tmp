Pupils at the Royal High School and at Tynecastle High in Gorgie were taken from their classes on Monday at 10:30.
Separately, two schools in Glasgow - High School of Glasgow and Hillhead High - were searched after threatening calls were received.
They were not evacuated and police said nothing untoward was found in either Edinburgh nor Glasgow.
On the Edinburgh evacuations, a Police Scotland spokesman said: "Two schools in Edinburgh were evacuated at around 10:30 on Monday 1 February following threats being made to three schools via telephone.
"Officers attended and searched all three premises, and nothing untoward was found.
"The schools are now operating as normal and inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding this."
A further Edinburgh school, Boroughmuir High, also received a call but but pupils were not required to leave their classrooms.
