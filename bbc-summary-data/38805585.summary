[SN]TITLE[SN]
Blackpool 0-0 Crawley Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Blackpool missed a penalty as their winless run extended to six league games after being held to a 0-0 League Two draw by Crawley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Seasiders squandered the golden opportunity after 21 minutes, when Neil Danns was upended in the area by Joe McNerney.
Danns took the penalty himself but put it well wide of the post.
Crawley's best effort of the first half came after 43 minutes, when Jordan Roberts struck powerfully from 20 yards - but it was straight at goalkeeper Sam Slocombe.
His opposite number Glenn Morris was called into action for the first time five minutes after the break as he leapt to his right to turn Andy Taylor's free-kick around the post.
The visitors passed up a great chance to go ahead after 54 minutes, when Slocombe spilled a corner but Jimmy Smith dragged the ball wide from ten yards.
Substitute Sanmi Odelusi thought he had grabbed a winner for Blackpool five minutes from time as he lashed the ball home but was penalised for handball.
