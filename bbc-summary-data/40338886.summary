Jo Rand, 47, from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, died from her injuries on Wednesday.
Family friend Owen Livett has set up an online fundraising page to help Ms Rand's two children who also lost their sister five years ago.
Mr Livett was involved in a car accident which killed Ms Rand's eldest daughter Charlotte, who was 19.
Thames Valley Police has launched a murder inquiry in connection with Ms Rand's death.
An 18-year-old man from London has been arrested.
Police believe Ms Rand was sprayed with an alkaline substance after a fight broke out between a group of men, close to where Ms Rand was sitting on a bench.
Mr Livett said he wants to help Ms Rand's 21-year-old son Ryan and 17-year-old daughter Katie raise Â£5,000 towards her funeral.
The 25-year-old from Marlow was the driver of a car which was hit by another vehicle which was being driven the wrong way down a dual carriageway by an undiagnosed dementia sufferer.
He said: "Jo was such a bubbly, lovely person, very caring, a great mother and a great friend.
"When the time is right, I want the money to be there so the children can afford to send their mum off in an appropriate way.
"They've already lost their big sister and now they've lost their mum, it's just so sad."
Almost half of the fundraising target has already been raised.
Donations have come from friends, family and colleagues of care worker Ms Rand plus a number of anonymous pledges.
Mr Livett said the "outpouring has been amazing".
