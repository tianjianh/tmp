A 'crinkle-crankle' Grade II listed garden wall in Suffolk, which was hit by a vehicle, has been restored for Â£10-15,000.

A section of the wall in Easton near Wickham Market was destroyed in a road accident in November and the driver has not been traced.
The owner said about 3,500 of the original bricks were cleaned by hand and re-used.
New speed limit signs and chevrons will be erected on the bend, he added.
About 500 bricks of a similar age were bought to replace the original bricks, which were destroyed, as the 20ft (6m) section of the snaking wall was rebuilt.
Ian Palfreyman, who owns the house that the wall surrounds, said the bend where the wall was had been an accident black spot.
"Obviously we're delighted the wall's back up and we've had positive feedback from villagers about the work using the original bricks," he said.
"We've gone six months without a major road accident and this could be down to the raised profile of the wall being knocked down and a higher police presence."
Mr Palfreyman said a 20mph speed limit would be introduced on the bend following talks involving villagers, Suffolk Police and Suffolk County Council.
He said: "New signs should go up by the end of June, so this should help in the long-term."
