The 26-year-old suffered the injury during fielding practice before T20 Blast Finals Day at Edgbaston.
Jarvis, who has played eight Tests for Zimbabwe, is the joint-leading wicket-taker in Division Two of the County Championship, his 62 scalps helping Lancashire to the brink of promotion.
Meanwhile, batsman Karl Brown has signed a new long-term contract.
The 27-year-old averages more than 52 in the Championship this summer, hitting a hundred and six half-centuries in just 12 innings, and has also featured prominently in Lancashire's run to the T20 Blast semi-finals.
"It was always my dream to play for my county and I am pleased to have been able to commit my future to Lancashire," Brown told the club website.
