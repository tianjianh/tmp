Sutton dominated the first half with Craig Eastmond denied by Shwan Jalal, Bedsente Gomis's effort was cleared off the line and Chris Dickson hit the crossbar.
Wrexham were not at their best but captain Newton's goal secured victory.
Gary Mills' side are 11th in the table with Sutton down to 15th.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales: "It's three points, it's what football is about and we've played well in games where we've lost.
"The team have been booed for losing, booed for drawing and booed for winning and it is what its and if the fans feel they didn't like what they saw and want to boo, then that's their prerogative.
"We've kept a few clean sheets and kept another one today. I'm going to be positive about today."
