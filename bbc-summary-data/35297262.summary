Lancashire Police said a 49-year-old old man had "voluntarily" attended a station by prior appointment.
He was not arrested but interviewed under caution regarding a rape allegation made on 4 January, the force said.
Earlier this month the Labour MP called the rape allegation against him "malicious, untrue and upsetting".
He was suspended by the party last month after he admitted sending lewd texts to a 17-year-old girl.
