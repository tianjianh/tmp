Carlisle United's January transfer window additions are likely to be dependent on players leaving Brunton Park, says manager Keith Curle.

The 53-year-old is keen to add to the squad to aid their League Two promotion bid, following back-to-back defeats at the start of 2017.
United are third in the table, six points behind leaders Doncaster having lost just three games in total.
"We're close to capacity," Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
"We're at a stage where we need to get players off the wage bill to bring players in.
"It's a different part of my job now where it's not [training] field based, it's office based where I need to move players on to bring players in."
United have already extended the loan of Newcastle defender Macaulay Gillesphey until the end of the season, a deal Curle says required a "re-jigging of figures presented to the Football League" to ensure the deal could go through under terms of the salary cap.
Short-term deals have also been given to defenders Kevin Wright and Alexander McQueen.
