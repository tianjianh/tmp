The former One Direction singer notched up combined sales of 112,000, including 4.97 million streams.
In the album charts, David Bowie became the first artist since Michael Jackson to knock himself off the top spot.
The 2002 release Best of Bowie replaced Blackstar, Bowie's last album, released days before his death in January.
Malik's Pillowtalk replaced Shawn Mendes' Stitches at the top of the singles chart, with Mendes falling to number three behind Fast Car, from Jonas Blue ft Dakota - a dance version of Tracy Chapman's 1988 single.
Rihanna's Work jumped from 13 to number four - and Justin Bieber finally relinquished his grip on the singles chart, with only one track in the top 10 - Love Yourself at number five.
Craig David entered the top 10 singles chart for the first time since 2007's Hot Stuff (Let's Dance). When the Bassline Drops moved into seventh position, 10 weeks after it was first released.
Sia's Chandelier is back in the top 40, climbing from 83 to 35, probably thanks to former Liberty X singer Kevin Simm's rendition on last week's episode of  BBC talent show The Voice.
Meanwhile Sia's album, This Is Acting, debuted at number three - behind Bowie, who held onto the number one and two spots.
Adele's 25 and Justin Bieber's Purpose complete the top five in the official UK album charts.
Rihanna's album, Anti - which charted for the first time this week after the initial free giveaway made it ineligible for last week's charts - went in at number seven.
It is the first of Rihanna's albums not to debut at number one since 2009, when Rated R entered the charts at number nine, but Anti is likely to climb in the coming weeks.
