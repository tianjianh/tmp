Premiership play-off final, second leg: Hamilton Academical v Dundee United (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hamilton Academical midfielders Massimo Donati and Dougie Imrie are doubtful for Sunday's Premiership play-off final second leg against Dundee United.

Donati ended the 0-0 first-leg draw with a groin problem and Imrie struggled to finish with a rib injury.
Midfielder Darian MacKinnon and injured captain Mikey Devlin are suspended.
United striker Simon Murray is free to play despite being sent off in the first leg, but midfielder Wato Kuate will not feature again for the club.
That could provide an opportunity in the starting line-up for Scott Fraser, Stewart Murdoch, Lewis Toshney, or Charlie Telfer, who came on for Kuate at Tannadice.
Fraser, who had an x-ray on a foot injury ahead of the first leg, and Murdoch, who has had a thigh injury, had hoped to be involved in the first leg but did not even make the bench.
Toshney, who has at times been utilised in midfield instead of his more recognised defensive role, made a surprise appearance as an unused substitute after being expected to miss out with a dislocated shoulder.
Cameroon-born Kuate was substituted immediately after on-field arguments with captain Sean Dillon and team-mate Mark Durnan - then fans on the sidelines as he left the field.
Manager Ray McKinnon said afterwards that the 21-year-old's behaviour would not be tolerated.
Murray was shown a second yellow card - both were for alleged diving - after 77 minutes at Tannadice.
But TV replays suggest the 25-year-old was fouled by Scott McMann inside the Accies penalty box in the second incident and United lodged an appeal on Friday.
Because the Scottish FA will not be able to hear the appeal until next Thursday, Murray is free to play at New Douglas Park.
With Accies' Devlin having been ruled out the play-offs with a season-ending injury and Georgios Sarris failing to recover from a back injury, former Celtic midfielder Donati was utilised in central defence in the first leg.
Manager Martin Canning will therefore be faced with another difficult selection problem at the back should Donati and Sarris fail to overcome injury to play on Sunday.

Imrie, though, has said he is ready to play through the pain barrier to help Accies avoid relegation.
The 33-year-old said that, while United were aggrieved about the Murray decision, he should have had a penalty early in the first half after being elbowed in the face by Durnan.
Hamilton, who have been in the top flight for the last three seasons, were forced into the play-off after finishing second bottom of the Premiership.
United, who suffered automatic relegation a year ago, have already won two-leg play-offs against Greenock Morton and Championship runners-up Falkirk after finishing third in the second tier.
A crowd of 9,386 attended the first leg at Tannadice and United will have the bulk of the support again at New Douglas Park.
The Tayside club say 3,000 of their fans have bought tickets for the second leg at the stadium that holds 5,500.
Hamilton Academical midfielder Dougie Imrie: "It is a one-off game, there is everything to play for.
"If we can play the way we did in the first half, with the chances we created and with some of the play, which was excellent, I am sure we will do enough.
"I thought we created two or three good opportunities and the keeper has kept them in the game with a couple of good saves.
"But we can't switch off. We will not take Dundee United for granted.
"We saw United's threats - breaking on us quickly - so we need to be switched on for that.
"They are a good team, they have come through two play-off ties already, so they are full of confidence.
"It is about who turns up, plays the best and scores the goals."
Dundee United manager Ray McKinnon: "The tie is in the balance, definitely.
"It is about whoever turns up and has the more desire, and maybe the wee bit of luck, who will be the victors.
"But it is wide open. It is all to play for. We want it to be exciting and it certainly will be on Sunday, no doubt.
"It might be a bit of magic. It might be determination. It might be a bit of luck. You can never tell.
"All we need to do is regroup and recover. That is what we have been doing for the last three weeks.
"I think the players have got quite used to it now and we will be ready to go on Sunday."
