The 1929 piece titled Composition No III, with Red, Blue, Yellow and Black, features the geometric style for which the artist became renowned.
The sale price, which includes a 12% buyer's premium, was more than twice its estimate of $15m-$25m (£10m-£16m).
Mondrian's previous auction record was $27.6m (£17.5m).
The auction capped two weeks of sales that have brought in record sums of money at both Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses.
Christie's alone took more than $1.3bn (£826m) during the course of its Monday and Wednesday sales this week.
On Monday, Picasso's Women of Algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, fetching $179.3m (£114m) including buyer's premium.
Alberto Giacometti's life-size sculpture Pointing Man also set a record for the most expensive sculpture, selling for $141.3m (£89.8m).
On Wednesday, expressionist Mark Rothko's No 10 sold for $81.9m (£52m), one of the highest sums ever paid for his work.
