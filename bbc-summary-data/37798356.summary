Halloween Week is finally coming to the ballroom this weekend and our celebrities have been training hard.
In honour of this special occasion, Ore takes Newsround behind the scenes in the Strictly wardrobe department - and you can see how busy everyone is!
This week, Ore and his dance partner Joanna will be dancing the tricky Charleston - let's hope it's frighteningly good!
If you're feeling in a creative Halloween mood, do send your terrifyingly brilliant pumpkin pictures to us.
