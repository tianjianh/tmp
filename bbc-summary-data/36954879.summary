The team behind Paralympic shot-putter Aled Davies

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
By the time he steps into the throwing circle in Rio, Aled Davies will be one man facing one challenge. But who are the 12 core people who help him get to that point?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shot-putter Davies has already broken the world record five times this year, and he is ready for it to fall again in his pursuit of gold.
As a gold and bronze medallist in London 2012 he is one of the experienced athletes to be competing in Brazil, despite being just 25 years old.
Davies said his ultimate aim is to compete with able-bodied athletes.
He said: "I see myself as an able-bodied athlete and I would like to think I would push myself up to be the best in Britain, and who knows there may be a Commonwealth vest there for me."
Although the athlete, from Bridgend, won his gold medal in the F42 discus in London, the event will not take place at Rio so he will be competing in the F42/44 shot put, in which he won bronze at the last games.
"I like to keep my team and things simple," said Davies. "If you do the hard work and put in the time, things will fall into place.
"Now I am pegged as favourite so it is going to be tough as it will take a world record to win, so I am preparing to win big. I am going there to execute a good performance and hopefully that will equate to a medal."
Davies said the last Paralympics was changing people's attitudes.
He said: "For me the Olympic legacy was seeing children walk around the Olympic park with prosthetic legs wearing shorts. I never did that because I didn't want to show my leg, so for me that is the legacy."
But who are the people behind his preparations?
Technical and mental preparation
Davies has been working towards the Paralympics since London 2012, and has been training with former Commonwealth Games shot-putter Ryan Spencer-Jones for the last two years.
"Ryan is my lead technical coach and my strength and conditioning coach," said Davies. "He is the most important part of my team. He writes the program for the gym and provides the technical work to compliment that.
"He is the core and is at every training session with me. He looks to see how fatigued I am as my body is injury prone.
"He also provides me with a lot of psychological support. We always have a positive attitude, whatever we do. He always reassures me that I am the best."
His training is monitored by former Olympic sprinter and Paula Dunn, while former British number one shot-putter Shaun Pickering mentors Mr Spencer-Jones.
The logistics - getting him there on the day and arranging kit
Maria Adey and Jan Richards from British Athletics enter Davies into competitions, and ensure he is there on the day.
He said: "If I'm going abroad to an event representing ParalympicsGB they will organise the flights and everything like that, and make sure I am entered into the competition."
Meanwhile his agent Mel Halling deals with the athlete's sponsors, kit, contractual commitments and media.
The body - preventing injury
Davies has a combined disability of Talipese and Hemi-hemilia in his right leg.
Due to his disability, he has extremely limited functionality of his right leg as it has missing bones, no muscle or ligament growth and a fixed foot, which was created at birth.
He is vulnerable to injury, so has regular treatments from physiotherapists Sian Knott and Nikki McLaughlin to keep this at bay.
"I see Sian three times a week," said Davies. "She works very closely with me. Nikki takes over when she is away, so he has been working with me in the build-up to the Paralympics while Sian is over at the Olympics."
The pair work alongside soft tissue therapist Dave Rowe, who also works with the Football Association of Wales. When he is away, such as when Euro 2016 was on, Delme Bennett takes over.
Training partners
Davies trains with fellow field athletes Welsh shotputter Lucy Griffiths, Greek discus thrower Eleni Zembashi and Welsh shot-putter Matthew Field.
He said: "They are at every session that I do, I have been working with them for two years.
"I'm in great shape at the moment I know my main rival will break the world record, he will start really strong.
"I am prepared for my world record to fall but to take it again. I'm a student of the sport. I want to be evolving with the event and really pushing."
