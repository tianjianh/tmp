The two will resume their championship fight in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, for which Hamilton is on pole by 0.007 seconds from Rosberg.
The two collided in Belgium two races ago, for which the team blamed Rosberg.
Hamilton said: "It seems to be nice and relaxed. Of course it was difficult after Spa but things look like they are back to normal."
Rosberg added: "The atmosphere in the team is very good. It is a great feeling at the moment.

"Yes, we have difficulties - there have been several during the year. That's natural; we're fighting for race wins every single weekend.
"But we discuss and then we move on. We have managed to do that very well this year. Of course it is intense internally and it will remain that way but it is being managed and it works OK at the moment."
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said he did not expect the drivers to have a similar incident in Singapore.
Hamilton heads into Sunday's grand prix 22 points behind Rosberg in the championship and a win for either would mark a potentially decisive shift in momentum.
If Hamilton triumphs, he will narrow the gap on Rosberg by at least seven points - the difference between first and second places. But if Rosberg beats him, the gap will open out to at least 29 points with only 150 remaining in the final five races of the season.
The Singapore race is the toughest of the season, with a long lap on a bumpy and demanding street circuit surrounded by concrete walls in hot and humid conditions that runs close to the maximum two-hour time limit.
