World Cup moments re-created in 8-bit art

Brazilian digital artist Matheus Toscano has been re-creating football moments in the classic "8-bit" style - inspired by the games consoles of yesteryear.

And, like those classic gaming machines, what the images lack in realism they more than make up for in character.
For the World Cup, Toscano, who makes the images on his tablet, faithfully re-created the most significant moments - biting and all.
Toscano has been creating the images since 2012, but the World Cup has brought him a wave of new fans.
"With no ambitions, I created a Twitter account and a blog to share my work, and the reactions were quite positive," he told the BBC.
"It is a hobby that I do in my free time. I did not expect to be such a success."
His hobby could extend further if his hopes of raising money to create a retro-style football game are met.
Below is a selection of World Cup moments, as drawn by Toscano. The rest of his work can be found on the project's website, 8Bit-Football.com - but don't expect to see a picture of Brazil's thumping loss to Germany.
"There were so many goals that I did not know what to draw," Toscano said.
