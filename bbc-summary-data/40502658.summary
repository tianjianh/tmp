Benjamin Wyatt, 34, was last seen at Half Moon Bay, a beach in Melbourne, while on holiday with his parents.
The Bath man, who has autism, disappeared about 14:15 local time on Tuesday (04:15 GMT) while his family went to pick up a car, police said.
"Ben has never had a night out on his own before," his mother, Diana Wyatt, told reporters on Wednesday.
"Ben, if you are listening, if you are watching, come back. Be brave - go to the policeman."
Mr Wyatt's father, Phil, urged locals to look out for his son, who has travelled alone at home but is unfamiliar with Melbourne.
Searches by police, including the use of a helicopter, have failed to provide any leads.
Mr Wyatt is 170cm (5ft 7in) tall and described as having a solid build, an unshaven face, short light-brown hair and brown eyes.
He was last seen wearing a blue hooded jumper and blue jeans.
