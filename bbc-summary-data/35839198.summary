Matt Harrold scored Crawley's first, however Luke Summerfield equalised with a penalty when Lewis Alessandra's run was stopped by Jon Ashton.
The visitors went ahead through Liam McAlinden's low shot, but Michael Coulson's curling 15-yard strike found the top corner to make it 2-2.
Crawley remain 16th in League Two while York's winless runs extends to eight.
York City manager Jackie McNamara told BBC Radio York:

"I think it's two points dropped. We should have won that.
"We lost two very poor goals again. I don't think Scott Flinders has had an entire save to make in the whole match.
"In terms of normal open play they didn't cause us one problem. "But being on the back foot has cost us."
