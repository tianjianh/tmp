Steve Way took up running aged 33 and ditched smoking, drinking and kebabs to come 10th in the Games marathon.
The Bournemouth resident is running the 26.2 mile (42km) race on Sunday as part of the Bournemouth Marathon Festival.
Races are on Saturday and Sunday, including a 5km, 10km, junior races and a half and full marathon.
Mr Way, 41, said: "I have long wanted to race a marathon in my hometown and the schedule works well this year to make it a reality.
"I took part in the half marathon last year and then set the marathon runners on their way as the official starter last year, which was a real honour.
"The atmosphere around town has been brilliant for the first two years of the Bournemouth Marathon Festival. I'm looking forward to enjoying the full 26.2 miles of it."
Ben Smith, from Bristol, is also taking part in the event as he is currently attempting to run 401 marathons in 401 days.
Bournemouth is the only marathon he is set to run twice.
Steve Edwards, 53, from Morton-in-Marsh in the Cotswolds, is due to run his 700th marathon on Sunday.
It is hoped he will set a new world record for running 700 marathons in the fastest average time at three hours and 18 minutes.
He has run every Bournemouth marathon since it started three years ago.
