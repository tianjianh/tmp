Arran farmers evicted 'after legal error'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers have been evicted from a farm after more than 20 years as a result of what they claim was a "legal error" made in 2003.

Ian and John Paterson, who have farmed Glenree Farm on Arran for more than 20 years, were evicted on Monday.
They are among several farmers granted secure tenure by the Scottish Parliament 13 years ago.
However, the move was overruled by the UK Supreme Court in 2013, who said it breached landlords' human rights.
This has led some landlords to serving eviction notices on the tenants so they can reclaim vacant possession.
All the farmers had previously held their tenancy in a "limited partnership", which can prevent tenants enjoying long-term security.
Holyrood's amendment to the Agricultural Holdings Act in 2003 was designed to provide this security - but the UK Supreme Court ruled in the test cast Salvesen v Riddell that it was not compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.
The court said landowners before and after a specific date had been treated differently, which amounted to discrimination.
The Paterson brothers have had to sell their equipment as they have no farm to go to and are facing an uncertain future.
Angus McCall, director of the Scottish Tenant Farmers Association, said: "It is a very sad day for two young brothers, very enthusiastic farmers who have done an awful lot to build up their business on Arran and they are being made homeless.
"It's not their fault, it's the fault of a legal error that was made 13 years ago and it's very, very sad that this has actually come to pass.
"The fault really lies with the parliament 13 years ago and the current government has had to pick up the pieces."
Six tenant farmers are now taking legal action against the Scottish government seeking compensation.
A Court of Session judgement is expected in the next few weeks.
Mr McCall said: "The affected tenants have taken a petition for a judicial review in the Court of Session. That has been heard and we are waiting for a decision.
"Part of that is that they are saying when the Scottish government brought forward its remedial order they should have provided some kind of compensation package."
A Scottish government spokesman said: "Having a thriving tenant farming sector as part of the Scottish agricultural industry is key to ensuring that we get the most from our land and the people who farm it.
"As such, we have a range of policies which support and encourage a vibrant tenanted sector.
"It is not possible for us to comment on or discuss the details of live court actions."
The spokesman added that the government was committed to facilitating and funding mediation between tenant farmers and their landlords.
