Traffic officers signalled Nathan Cook to pull over on a routine stop on the A74(M) at Lockerbie in March last year.
He travelled at speed for 33 miles before he was boxed in by four police cars at Elvanfoot in Lanarkshire.
At the High Court in Edinburgh, Cook, 28, of High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, admitted being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.
Judge Lord Uist praised police for intercepting the huge haul of heroin.
He said: "It is very fortunate that the police decided to stop this car because it stopped 18.5kg of heroin getting onto the streets.
"They are to be commended for that."
Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court that Cook was acting as a courier, delivering drugs for further cutting and distribution.
The court heard that the haul was worth £832,500 at wholesale value but because of its high purity, it could be adulterated and bulked out to make £7,999,300 worth of individual deals.
Cook was remanded in custody and will be sentenced in January next year.
