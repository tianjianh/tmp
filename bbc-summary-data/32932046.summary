[SN]TITLE[SN]
Engineer regiment receives Freedom of Ludgershall

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
More than 200 soldiers have marched through a Wiltshire town to accept the freedom of Ludgershall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ludgershall Town Council bestowed the honour to mark the friendship with 26 Engineer Regiment since it re-formed in the town in 2000.
Outside the town's Memorial Hall the regiment based at Perham Down, saluted civic dignitaries and senior officers.
The march with colours flying and fixed bayonets was led by the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers.
During a ceremonial lunch held after the parade, the freedom citation was formally accepted on behalf of the Regiment by Lt Col Fossey.
Part of that citation read: "26 Engineer Regiment, Corps of Royal Engineers, has achieved for itself honour and renown everywhere not only for the valour of its officers and men but also by their pioneering exploits and achievements at home and overseas."
The tradition of granting the freedom of a town, or city, dates from when settlements were guarded from outlaws and feudal lords.
Bodies of armed men were refused entry into a town unless the citizens were confident that they meant no harm.
The granting became a mark of trust and confidence in how that body was held by the citizens of the town.
Other guests at the ceremony included Devizes MP Clare Perry, the High Sheriff of Wiltshire, Lady Gooch JP and Jane Scott, leader of Wiltshire Council.
