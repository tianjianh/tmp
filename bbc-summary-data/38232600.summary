Many more are feared trapped under rubble after hundreds of buildings collapsed.
Thousands of people have been forced to take refuge in temporary shelters and mosques.
Some have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed, others have fled their homes amid fears of aftershocks and a possible tsunami.
Rescue workers used diggers to remove rubble in their search efforts overnight on Wednesday.
Others used their bare hands and shovels to find people.
A few survivors were pulled out alive on Wednesday.
More than 200 buildings were either seriously damaged or toppled in the earthquake.
The Pidie Jaya region, on the north Aceh coast, was the hardest hit.
The tremor hit just offshore early on Wednesday morning.
Many of the homes in the area have corrugated tin roofs which collapsed.
Hundreds have also been rushed to the sole functioning hospital, which has been overwhelmed by patients.
Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, was one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 tsunami, caused by a massive earthquake.
