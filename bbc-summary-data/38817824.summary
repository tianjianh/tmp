Three new Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) have been approved by the Welsh Government and will now go before the European Commission for consideration.
They are North Anglesey Marine, West Wales Marine and the Bristol Channel Approaches.
The SACs will complement existing conservation measures in place throughout UK waters.
Three other marine areas have also been approved as Special Protection Areas (SPA), including:
Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths said: "We are committed to creating a network of marine protected areas in Wales so species and habitats can thrive.
"A rich and healthy marine environment ensures the sustainable use of our seas now and in the future."
The new conservation protection areas follow a consultation carried out by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) last year.
Ceri Davies, NRW executive director for evidence, policy and permitting, said: "We are proud that the seas around Wales support such a rich diversity of wildlife, which is highly valued by local communities and sustains important businesses such as fishing, tourism and recreation."
