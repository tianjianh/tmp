The Air India Airbus A320 was hoisted 20m (60ft) above the ground while being moved at Begumpet Airport in Hyderabad to the company's nearby flight training centre.
The crane, mounted on a large road transporter, buckled under the aircraft's weight - 25 tonnes.
No-one was hurt. Despite the mishap, the plane will still be used for training, Air India said.
