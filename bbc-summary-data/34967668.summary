The gun attack took place at the Grosvenor Homing Pigeon Club on Iveagh Street, off the Falls Road, shortly before 16:00 GMT on Monday.
Police said both men sustained gunshot injuries to their legs. They are in a stable condition in hospital.
West Belfast MP Paul Maskey, from Sinn FÃ©in, said the attack was carried out by two masked men.  Mr Maskey said it had "installed fear" in the community.
"I am very surprised that these two men have been shot today inside a bar where people are working, people are socialising, trying to get on with their daily lives and enjoying themselves," the MP said.
He described the shooting as "shameful" and said it was an "attack on the whole community".
Mr Maskey also told the BBC it was his understanding that the victims' injuries were not life-threatening.
West Belfast MLA Alex Attwood, from the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), also condemned the shooting.
"This is the third time in two weeks that guns have been used on the streets of West Belfast.
"Every attack is unjustified and the response to each and every attack must be unambiguous. People must provide information to the police," Mr Attwood said.
Grosvenor Homing Pigeon Club is a social club formed several years ago by pigeon fanciers and pigeon racing enthusiasts.
Det Insp Nigel Snoddy appealed to anyone who was in the area at the time and who has any information to contact detectives.
