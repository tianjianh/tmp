Police said officers detained the men, whose nationalities are not yet known, in Pilgrims Way, Westerham, at about 09:30 BST.
A spokeswoman said they had all been passed to immigration authorities.
It is the latest in a series of incidents in the county this month with 24 Eritreans found in the back of a lorry on Friday.
They were inside a refrigerated vehicle and were heard knocking and pleading for air.
Other suspected illegal immigrants have been found walking along the M20 near the Channel Tunnel, and clinging to the underneath of motorhomes.
