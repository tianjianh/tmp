[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 3-1 Notts County

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitutes Matt Green and Darius Henderson scored in injury time as Mansfield Town secured a dramatic derby victory over Notts County.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Notts dominated the first half, but Green came off the bench and struck home the opener with his first touch.
The visitors seemed set to earn a point through a deflected Alex Rodman shot.
But Green netted with a penalty after Mal Benning was deemed to have been fouled by Matt Tootle and Henderson ran through and fired in a third.
Green had scored twice in the corresponding fixture last season which the Stags won 5-0.
But a repeat result, or individual goalscoring feat, seemed highly unlikely as Notts seized control before the interval.
The Magpies could have been 3-0 up at the break, Jonathan Forte shooting against the post and wasting a one-on-one chance, and Jon Stead having a shot cleared off the line.
But Green's introduction sparked a much-improved display by the hosts and, although Rodman cancelled out Green's scrappy opener, the striker kept his cool with his spot-kick for his second and Henderson's first goal for the club sealed all three points.
