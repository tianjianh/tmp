Yorkshire are capable of winning the treble in 2016, according to all-rounder Will Rhodes.

The White Rose won the County Championship in 2014 and 2015 but have disappointed in the limited-overs forms of the game in the past two seasons.
"Every side goes into every season wanting to win every game they play and we see that as a realistic goal," Rhodes, 20, told BBC Radio Humberside.
"We believe we can win the treble but it will be a massive task."
He added: "Warwickshire came close in 2014 when they finished second in the County Championship, won the T20 and were runners-up in the One-Day Cup. They proved it can be done."
Rhodes opened the batting for Yorkshire at the start of 2015 while Adam Lyth was playing for England, and ended the season with 388 runs and eight wickets in nine matches.
The former England Under-19 international will spend a month in India before the 2016 season.
"I'm going out to India because batting against spin in limited-overs cricket was a big area for me to improve," said Rhodes.
"I'm really looking forward to getting out there. It's going to be a big challenge and a great trip.
"I'm hoping to pick up on some local knowledge because we don't really play on many spin-worthy pitches here."
