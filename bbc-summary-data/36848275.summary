Hearts have completed a season-long loan deal to bring in former Celtic striker Tony Watt from Charlton.

The 22-year-old started last season at the English Championship club before loan spells at Cardiff and Blackburn.
"I'm still young and I've got a large chunk of my career ahead of me," Watt, who made a surprise Scotland debut in March, told Hearts TV.
"This is a big club and I want to come back to Scotland, play games and get a bit of stability."
Watt is best known for scoring the winning goal in Celtic's Champions League win over Barcelona in 2012.
He subsequently had spells at Belgian clubs Lierse and Standard Liege before joining Charlton in January 2015.
"I had a stop-start season last year for a variety of reasons, both in terms of injury and being out on loan at a few clubs," he added.
"I'm not far away in terms of fitness, I'm ready to go and just need game time really.
"So I'm looking forward to getting started. I've never played at Tynecastle before, I've been on the bench here once, but that's it.
"I'm looking forward to playing here and hopefully the fans will be cheering my name."
Hearts also have German defender Marcel Appiah training with their squad, ahead of the second leg of their Europa League second qualifying round tie against Maltese side Birkirkara on Thursday.
The 28-year-old, who can play at right-back or centre-back, played against Sunderland in a closed-door game at Riccarton on Saturday.
Appiah has previously played for German club Arminia Bielefeld but spent the last two years in the Netherlands with NEC Nijmegen.
"We have had a few defenders in recently," Neilson said on Tuesday. "We had [Northern Ireland international] Liam Donnelly in last week. We have a German in this week. It's an area we need one more in.
"We are still looking to recruit. We are still looking for a striker and we need a wide player as well. I'm really happy with the squad I have at the moment and it's just adding that little bit of quality. If that takes a little bit of time then I'm more than happy to wait."
