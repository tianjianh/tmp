Rio 2016: Hurdler Rhys Williams considering future after missing Olympics

Rhys Williams says he is considering his athletics future after missing out on a place in Team GB's squad for the Rio 2016 Olympics.

The Welsh 400m hurdler, 32, met the Olympic qualifying time in May, but failed to win automatic Rio selection at the British Championships.
Williams failed in his appeal, which he said was "a bitter pill to swallow".
"Sport requires so much dedication... It's whether I've still got that drive and motivation," he told Newyddion 9.
The 2012 European 400m hurdle champion said, at the moment, his love for the sport is not there, but added: "hopefully in the coming weeks it will be.
"I'm not going to make any rash decisions because I want to see Wales, off the back of this Olympics, springboard into the Commonwealth Games... and I've always wanted to be one of the main Welsh athletes there."
Asked if athletics fans would see him at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, the 2012 Olympian replied: "I hope so, we'll see."
Williams was left out of the Team GB squad for Rio after missing out on a place in the top two at the British Championships in June and finishing fifth at the European Championships in July.
The British Athletics selection panel did not feel that he would win a medal in Rio or at a future Olympic Games.
Williams, who received a four-month ban for doping in 2014 and missed that year's Commonwealth Games, admitted watching the Olympics from home "has been tough".
"When you've just fallen short over a selector not thinking you're quite good enough, even though you're much better than some of the athletes they've taken, it's a bitter pill to swallow.
"But that's life, that's sport and you've just got to get on with it.
"I really wanted to almost end my athletics career on a high, and I almost did that and I just fell short."
Seren Bundy-Davies was the only Welsh track and field athlete named in Great Britain's team for the Olympics.
It means Wales has just one athletics competitor at an Olympics for the first time since the 1952 Helsinki Games.
Williams fears Wales might struggle to send a larger athletics contingent to future Games unless more talent starts coming through the system.
"Sport is up and down and Welsh Athletics have got actually a great system in place and a great head coach.
"What they haven't got is enough athletes coming through, they get lost to rugby, football, hockey, [and] netball so until that's sorted, it's not going to change much."
