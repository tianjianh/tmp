The hosts, whose only goal in October so far came via an own goal from Southend's Luke Prosser, struggled to make any clear-cut chances.
Crewe keeper Ben Garratt pulled off a number of good saves from Robbie Weir, Lucas Akins and Masser El Khayati.
Burton almost scored in the last minute but Mark Duffy's free-kick hit the underside of the crossbar.
On-loan Liverpool teenager Harry Wilson made his first start for the Alex, having previously made three appearances from the bench.
Crewe are now four points adrift of safety heading into Saturday's trip to fellow strugglers Blackpool.
Burton Albion manager Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink told BBC Radio Derby:

"It wasn't meant to be, but I'm very proud of them and very happy with them. I have nothing but praise for them.
"In another game we win 3-0, easily, but today it wasn't meant to be, and we can build from this.
"We can look at a lot of plusses. A lot of plusses."
Crewe manager Steve Davis told BBC Radio Stoke:
"We have played the top eight now apart from Sheffield United and we have been in every game. That is the positive to take.
"There is still a long way to go and a lot of points to play for. We now have to take that confidence into Blackpool on Saturday.
"We had a couple of late free-kicks that caused us a bit of a concern but we defended well and the spirit has always been good."
