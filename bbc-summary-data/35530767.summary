A further £201m has been announced for design work on the Royal Navy's next generation of nuclear submarines.

It will fund equipment and systems layout design and prototype production.
The Successor vessels, designed at BAE Systems' Barrow shipyard in Cumbria, will replace the ageing Vanguard class from the early 2030s.
Chief of Materiel (Fleet) Vice Admiral Simon Lister called it "the most technologically advanced nuclear submarine" in the Royal Navy's history.
The funding is part of £3.3bn for the programme's assessment phase.
Previous contracts of £257m in 2015 and £328m and £315m in 2012 were awarded to BAE Systems for the initial design.
The latest cash is to fund "innovation, design and engineering" work by BAE Systems, Babcock International, Rolls-Royce and other potential suppliers.
About 6,500 people work at the Barrow site, where BAE is also building seven Astute class nuclear-powered attack submarines for the Royal Navy.
