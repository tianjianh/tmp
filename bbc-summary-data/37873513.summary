Graham O'Shea, 42, "intensively instructed" the woman, police said, before selecting a piece and telling her she "would be leaving in a black box" if it was the last one left.
He also "took control of every aspect" of her life.
O'Shea, of Mixenden, Halifax, was jailed for four years.
He was also given a life-long restraining order against the victim and her family when he was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on Monday.

He refused to let the woman wash herself or visit her family, and gave her an allowance of Â£10 per week after taking her bank cards.
"He escorted her to and from the bus stop when she went to work and regularly accused her of infidelity," it added.
O'Shea also assaulted his ex on two occasions, police said
The woman contacted police in May after escaping the property and fleeing to her father's house.
The new law was introduced last December.
