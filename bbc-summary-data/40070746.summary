Two RAF fighters were scrambled in Scotland after two Russian planes entered UK airspace, the MoD has confirmed.

A pair of Typhoon jets took off from RAF Lossiemouth on Saturday morning.
An MOD spokesman said the fighters which were scrambled "in response to two Russian aircraft entering the UK's airspace", had both since returned.
The RAF and Royal Navy have been frequently called on to monitor Russian planes and warships in recent years.
Fighter jets were sent to monitor two Russian Tupolev TU-160 Blackjack bombers, which passed near UK airspace in February.
And in January, Type 23 frigate HMS St Albans was deployed to "man mark" the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov and its battlegroup as the vessels sailed close to UK territorial waters, returning from operations supporting the offensive in Syria.
The Kuznetsov group had previously passed through the Channel last autumn on its way to the Mediterranean and was escorted by Type 45 destroyer HMS Duncan and Type 23 frigate HMS Richmond.
