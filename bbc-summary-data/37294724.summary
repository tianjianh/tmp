Royal Victoria Hospital: RQIA report finds overcrowding

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A report from the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA) has laid out concerns about patient overcrowding at the emergency department (ED) in the Royal Victoria Hospital.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The RQIA highlighted issues with the flow of patients through the emergency department during particularly busy periods.
The RQIA said overcrowding "made it difficult for staff to provide basic nursing care and maintain the dignity and privacy of patients".
Patients and relatives who spoke to the RQIA's inspectors were positive about the care they received.
However, the report said "when the ED was busy issues were identified in relation to communication, staff shortages and waiting times".
The unannounced inspection was carried out last December over a three-day period.
