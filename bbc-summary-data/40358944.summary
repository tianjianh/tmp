[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 61-year-old man, believed to be the doctor who carried out the procedure, has been arrested on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent.
The boy's mother complained to police, saying her son was circumcised without her consent while staying with his paternal grandparents in July 2013.
A 44-year-old man and a woman, aged 47, have also been arrested.
Nottinghamshire Police said they were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm.
All three people have been released pending further investigation.

The doctor previously told the BBC: "It would be inappropriate to comment whilst any investigation is ongoing."
He has not publicly clarified whether or not he had been told the mother had consented to the procedure.
The boy was circumcised in Nottingham on 31 July 2013.
His mother originally contacted social services, then contacted police on 24 November 2014.
There was a police inquiry but the force initially deemed it not to be a criminal matter, and the matter was referred to the General Medical Council.
The boy's mother believes circumcision amounts to MGM, or "male genital mutilation", and is "inhumane".
She says her son, now aged four, has suffered recurring physical problems including inflammation and water infections.
"I am deeply hurt by what has happened to my son and the suffering I have been forced to witness," she said.
"No amount of money in the world could make right what's been done, and my only hope is to raise awareness of MGM and reveal the true suffering this procedure really inflicts on tiny babies.
"My life will never be the same again and I dread my son growing up and learning what happened to him."
Police reopened the investigation after the mother got help from the anti-circumcision group Men Do Complain and leading human rights lawyer Saimo Chahal QC, who wrote to the force.
