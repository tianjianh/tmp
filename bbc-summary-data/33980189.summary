Thousands of lucky spectators were treated to a spectacle of the skies when more than a dozen Spitfires and handful of Hurricanes carried out a flypast to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain's "Hardest Day".

The weather may have been chilly and overcast but it did not lessen the dazzling impact of more than 20 vintage aircraft flying in three formations over London and the south-east coast.
The event at Biggin Hill in south-east London marked 75 years since 18 August 1940, when British and German pilots engaged in the hardest fought day of the Battle of Britain.
After taking off just after 13:00 BST, the iconic fighters circled London and then flew to the battle's official memorial at Capel-le-Ferne near the White Cliffs of Dover.
On their return they wowed the crowds with multiple flypasts of the airfield - banking, climbing, diving and weaving as they went.
Dozens of veterans of the Battle of Britain and other World War Two servicemen and women were also invited to take part in the commemoration.
Flying Officer Gerry Abrahams, who flew Lancaster bombers over Germany during the war, said the event was a fantastic opportunity to see a huge number of Spitfires and Hurricanes in one place.
"It's never happened since the war it's incredible."
He and the other veterans were given a VIP view of the display, a sit-down lunch and dozens of requests from members of the public asking them to accept a handshake to thank them for their service.
Once the Hurricanes and Spitfires were finally back on the ground, the spectators were given the opportunity walk among the aircraft.
Kevin Wilford, of Caterham, Surrey, said he had brought his grandson Peter to the event because "you'll never get the opportunity to see this many Spitfires again".
"It's been fantastic, seeing them flying all round, all over the place was like a trip back in time.
"I've been to airshows before but it's not like this," he added.
Eight-year-old Peter said: "I enjoyed it when they all came round in their groups and did a huge display."
And it was not just the aircraft that were on show at Biggin Hill today.
There were nearly a dozen vintage vehicles and more than 30 people dressed in period wartime uniforms and civilian clothes to help transport people back to the summer of 1940.
And some of the men dressed as World War Two pilots also carried out a mock fighter pilot scramble to the crowds' delight.
