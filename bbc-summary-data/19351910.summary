Tourism minister Arlene Foster has said a new Ulster Scots mobile app could help boost tourism from overseas.

The new app would plan journeys for users through different areas of Ulster Scots historical interest such as Castle Balfour in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh.
There will be three different routes available on the app including routes around Donegal and Fermanagh.
About 30 million people across the world have Ulster Scots ancestry.
The app was part funded by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure.
"The app really brings alive historical sites," said Mrs Foster.
"I think local people will also enjoy using the app and finding out interesting information about the area that they live.
"Around 30 million people across the world have Scots Irish routes and I want them to come here and explore their past. I think this app will really help them do that."
The app will include information on 200 locations across Northern Ireland that form part of the Ulster Scots story over the last 500 years.
The sites include towns and villages, castles and churches, graveyards and monuments, and archives and industries.
This project builds on the Ulster Historical Foundations previous work with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Tourism Ireland to highlight the historical and cultural connections between Ireland and Scotland in a positive and inclusive way.
