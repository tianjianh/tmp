[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicklas Bendtner has left Wolfsburg after reaching an agreement to end his contract a year early.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 28-year-old Denmark striker has not played since February and was told not to attend training any more last month.
He was fined for being 45 minutes late for training in March and also punished in February for posting a picture of his Mercedes car on social media. The club are owned by Volkswagen.
He joined the Bundesliga side after leaving Arsenal in August 2014.
However, he only scored three goals in 31 league appearances before being frozen out.
Wolfsburg director of sport Klaus Allofs said: "Both Nicklas and ourselves had high hopes of his engagement at VfL Wolfsburg, but after two years we have had to ascertain that the expectations were neither fulfilled for him, nor for us, and a continued cooperation made no sense for either side.
"For that reason, the mutual decision to end our association prematurely is thus the best solution for all parties. We wish Nicklas all the very best for his future career."
