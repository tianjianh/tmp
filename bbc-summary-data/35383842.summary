Ben & Jerry's tubs and Feast ice creams are among those whose portion size will shrink, according to a report in trade journal The Grocer.
Unilever said the move was to help consumers "make healthier choices."
From the spring, "single serving" portions will contain no more than 250 calories.
Unilever's UK ice cream marketing director Noel Clarke said: "We have introduced this 250 calorie cap to help make it easier for our consumers to make informed and healthier choices when enjoying their favourite ice creams as part of a balanced lifestyle."
Some products, worth Â£5.4m in sales, will be dropped altogether, The Guardian reported.
Magnum Infinity Chocolate & Caramel, Magnum Infinity Chocolate, and Cornetto Choc 'N' Ball are some products that will melt away, the newspaper said.
