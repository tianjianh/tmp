Liam Kelly: Leyton Orient boss Danny Webb says six-game ban is 'excessive'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Leyton Orient manager Danny Webb believes the six-game ban handed to Liam Kelly by the Football Association for pushing a ball boy is "excessive".

Kelly was reported to the FA by Plymouth Argyle after an incident in Orient's 3-2 win on 14 February.
Orient's captain denied a charge of violent conduct, but the FA found him guilty, deeming the standard three-match ban to be "clearly insufficient".
"I think it's extremely excessive, when you look at the past cases," Webb said.
He told BBC Radio London: "For me it was a three-match ban, but to go to six, I feel like we're being used as an example just to try and stop people doing that.
"You shouldn't do it, and Liam shouldn't have done it, but for me it's excessive."
Webb, who has been in charge of relegation-threatened Orient since January, was also critical of Plymouth's role in the incident, which happened in the 86th minute of the League Two match.
"The referee - did he see it, did he not? Who knows," Webb, 33, added.
"Plymouth definitely saw it, and I think that's the most disappointing thing, that a club that hold such high moral standards as Plymouth have got the nerve to criticise, to try and make a bigger thing out of something."
Having sat out of The O's 3-2 defeat by Notts County on Saturday, Kelly will now miss five more matches for 23rd placed Orient, including crucial ties against fellow strugglers Cheltenham Town, Newport County and Accrington Stanley.
