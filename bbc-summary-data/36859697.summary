The 52-year-old took the post in February 2015 after 30 years at Manchester United as a player, youth coach and academy director.
But SFA chief executive Stewart Regan said the role "requires a different style of leadership and focus".
"I am deeply disappointed I couldn't make a significant difference," said former Scotland striker McClair.
"But I would like to thank my staff for the help they have given me and the board for the opportunity.
"I would also like to wish my successor all the best in the future in their efforts to develop the environment for the young talent that Scotland deserves."
BBC Scotland understands McClair was left frustrated at having to try to sell the SFA's performance strategy around the boardrooms of Scottish football.
There will be no swift replacement as the governing body take their time to reassess and refine the role before appointing his successor.
Regan said: "I would like to thank Brian for his time as performance director. I am really disappointed that we have parted company after a year, but the complexities of the role cannot be overestimated.
"While his experience of developing talent over a sustained period of time at Manchester United was a major attribute, being performance director requires a different style of leadership and focus.
"As performance director, he found himself spending more time lobbying and presenting in the boardroom. It became apparent that this was neither a comfortable nor tenable situation in the long term.
"I would like to reiterate my thanks to Brian for his efforts and wish him the best of luck in the future".
