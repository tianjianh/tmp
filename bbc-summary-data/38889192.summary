[SN]TITLE[SN]
Rotherham United 2-3 Huddersfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tommy Smith scored a late goal against bottom-of-the-table Rotherham to extend high-flying Huddersfield's Championship winning streak to five games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Semi Ajayi stabbed the Millers in front from a corner, but Town equalised through Joe Lolley's low, curling shot.
Tom Adeyemi then restored Rotherham's lead from 25 yards, but Elias Kachunga headed in a corner just minutes later.
And Smith powered in a wonderful half-volley in the 92nd minute to claim a dramatic comeback win for Huddersfield.
Struggling Rotherham had managed just one win in their past 14 league meetings with Huddersfield but started the brighter of the two sides, with Richard Wood dangerous from set-pieces.
But after Ajayi's first goal for the club from close range, their in-form and third-placed opponents showed their cutting edge, with Lolley finding the corner from the edge of the area.
Adeyemi's stunning fifth league goal of the season looked to have a first league win in a month on the cards, but Kachunga made amends for an earlier miss from Aaron Mooy's delivery.
Smith then completed the turnaround in added time to cut the gap to the automatic promotion places to four points after Brighton were held to a 1-1 draw by Ipswich.
Despite a spirited performance, Rotherham remain rooted in 24th position, 12 points behind both Blackburn and Wigan.
Rotherham United interim boss Paul Warne:
"To concede so late on is difficult to swallow. It was hard for me to look at them. I am proud of the performance, I am disappointed with the result.
"I didn't think they were going to score, I thought luck was on my side.
"It was a great goal for them, but I thought our lads competed with them toe-to-toe, I am proud of the way the lads played. The lads give me everything, I can't go in an annihilate them."
Huddersfield Town manager David Wagner:
"There may be no better way to show the character, the togetherness and the quality which the squad has.
"The second half was fantastic, we played very well, we created chances.
"You see we scored the winner in stoppage time. It sounds like we were lucky but in my opinion we were not lucky, we were strong and totally deserved to win the football match. If we needed a push for the last 15 games of the season this can give it to us."
