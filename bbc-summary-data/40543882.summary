The match on Court Two was halted for bad light just after 21:00 BST on Friday and when played resumed on Saturday, the 24th seed immediately broke France's Tsonga to win 6-2 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 1-6 7-5.
Grigor Dimitrov is also through after Israel's Dudi Sela retired with injury.
The Bulgarian was leading 6-1 6-1.
Sela lost the first set in 23 minutes before he called for the trainer and then went off court for a medical time-out to treat a leg injury.
He returned 10 minutes later, but retired immediately after 13th seed Dimitrov had won the second set.
Last year's runner-up Milos Raonic of Canada beat Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 7-5 to progress to the second week.

Gael Monfils, seeded 15, suffered a shock defeat by world number 51 Adrian Mannarino.

Austria's Dominic Thiem, seeded eighth, comfortably beat America's world number 67 Jared Donaldson, 7-5 6-4 6-2.

Querrey, who knocked out Novak Djokovic on his way to the quarter-finals last year, said: "After such a great match it was a bit of an anti-climax in the end.
"I've been in that situation before (coming out to serve to stay in a match) and it's tough."
Tsonga, the 12th seed, smashed a ball out of the court after the defeat.
"I'm frustrated because I lost and I stayed two minutes on court today," he said.
When he was asked if the match should have been halted on Friday, he replied: "I was OK with that. It's not a problem. If I come and win my game, we continue.
"It's just part of the game. I did what I had to do. Unfortunately it didn't work."
Tsonga had faced a similar fate at the French Open, when his first-round tie against Renzo Olivo was stopped for bad light.
They returned the following day, only for Tsonga to lose after one game.
