The building at the bottom of the Ormeau Road has been home to the broadcaster since it first went on air in 1959.
UTV Head of News and Programmes Terry Brennan said the relocation will happen in 2018.
The move to new premises is a result of "significant investment in UTV regional news".
"That will be in 2018, following a full technical build, once suitable centrally located premises are agreed.
"This will ensure the new HD studios are the most modern in Europe and fit for future broadcast requirements," said Mr Brennan.
"This investment underpins ITV's commitment to UTV's regional news service. The new UTV Broadcast Centre will house studios, edit suites, corporate offices and news, administration, finance and sales areas."
Mr Brennan's appointment as head of news and programmes was announced last week.
More than 40 jobs are at risk at UTV, which is controlled by ITV, however the newsroom is not affected.
The threatened posts are understood to be primarily in the sales department but also include library staff, online staff and 'playout' (transmission services).
