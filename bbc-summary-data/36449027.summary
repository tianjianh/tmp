The photographs, scarves and videos tell the remarkable story of Leicester City's rise from relegation candidates to champions of England.
Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: "The organisers set about in 45 days to put together this amazing exhibition."
The free-to-enter show runs until September.
Tracing the journey month by month, it explores how people around the world reacted to the unlikely success of the team, who were 5,000-1 outsiders to win the Premier League Trophy at the season's outset.
Archivist John Hutchinson said he used photos and social media posts from during the season to retell the story.
"We enjoyed collecting the memorabilia and we have more than 50 items from the season from signed shirts to Captain Morgan's rum (named after Leicester City captain Wes Morgan) to Claudio Ranieri's bell through to clapper boards.
"You can relive the whole fairytale season again â€¦ after 132 years we have been waiting a long time for this so come in and enjoy it," Leicester City club ambassador Alan Birchenhall said.
He said there was also an area for people to add to the exhibits over the summer with their drawings, photos and stories.
"I have never known a season like this. What has happened has been truly historic and this exhibition really captures that magnificent achievement."
