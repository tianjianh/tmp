Robert Snodgrass is optimistic about being fit for Scotland's opening World Cup qualifier, despite a painful collision with a goalpost.

Both the Hull City midfielder and Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths will be assessed for injuries as they report for duty for Sunday's game in Malta.
Snodgrass wrote on Instagram: "See how the quad is over the next few days but hope to be ok for international duty."
He suffered the leg injury during Hull's 1-0 defeat by Manchester United.
"Gutted had to go off, but in future I can't tackle goalposts - there is only one winner," said Snodgrass, who was replaced after 48 minutes by Shaun Maloney, who was left out of Gordon Strachan's squad for the game on 4 September because of a lack of playing action.
Griffiths went off just before the hour mark with a hamstring complaint during Celtic's 4-1 victory over Aberdeen.
The striker said on Twitter: "I've been struggling with my hamstring a bit.
"I'll go away with Scotland and see the physio there. I always want to play for my country, I don't want to let anyone down."
While Griffiths scored his seventh goal of the season for Celtic, his rivals for a starting place with Scotland were not faring so well.
Steven Fletcher came off after 66 minutes as Sheffield Wednesday drew with Brentford, Steven Naismith lasted two minutes less as Norwich City fell to a 3-0 defeat by Birmingham City, while Chris Martin was substituted 11 minutes after the break in Derby County's 1-0 loss away to Burton Albion.
Naismith is the only one of those three to have scored this season.
Alan Hutton, who has been Strachan's first choice at right-back, was an unused substitute for Aston Villa, as was the case for his preferred pairing in central defence - Newcastle United's Grant Hanley and Russell Martin of Norwich.
Christophe Berra did manage 90 minutes as Ipswich Town beat Preston North End, while Gordon Greer made his sixth appearance for new club Blackburn Rovers, although a home defeat by Fulham leaves Owen Coyle's side at the foot of the English Championship.
A lack of game time will be a concern for Strachan over winger Ikechi Anya, who has only had nine minutes of action in Watford's first three Premier League games and was not in their weekend squad.
Goalkeeper Craig Gordon was dropped by Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers against Aberdeen, while David Marshall was left out of the Cardiff City squad pending a proposed transfer to Hull.
On a positive note for Scotland boss Strachan, whose squad will gather on Tuesday, two wingers were in scoring form over the weekend.
James Forrest found the net for the third time this season, while Oliver Burke grabbed his fourth of the campaign as Nottingham Forest beat Leeds United amid reports of a possible big-money transfer for the 19-year-old.
Callum Paterson added his second goal of the season as Hearts beat Partick Thistle to put pressure on Hutton for a start at right-back.
