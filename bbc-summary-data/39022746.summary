Her 13-month-old daughter was airlifted to hospital and treated for minor injuries before being released.

"I would like to thank everyone who assisted at the scene."
He urged anyone who saw a black Nissan Note at about 10:50 on Saturday on the A92 Inverbervie to Kinneff road, to contact police on the 101 number.
