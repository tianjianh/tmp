The trio recorded Look Into Your Heart at Abbey Road studios, with Sir Mick on backing vocals and Wood on guitar.
It was produced by Pink Floyd's Nick Mason and will raise funds for Save the Children's Nepal Earthquake appeal.
The single also features a choir of 100 of the charity's supporters, who won the opportunity in a charity auction.
"The terrible events in Nepal show just how vulnerable our fellow man can be in the face of nature," said lead vocalist Knight.
"My hope is that the proceeds of this song will go some way to help raise urgently needed funds to repair homes and restore lives."
Wood said he was "delighted" to be able to help with the Nepal Appeal by featuring on the single, which is available to download on iTunes.
The earthquake on 25 April is now known to have killed more than 7,500 people and has injured more than 14,500.
More than 4,000 aid workers from around the world have been helping with relief and rescue operations.
