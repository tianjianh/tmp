[SN]TITLE[SN]
Former Commons clerk goes back to Welsh roots in Lords

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales has a new cross-bench peer.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lord Lisvane took his seat in the House of Lords this morning. He is perhaps better known as Sir Robert Rogers, whose familiar bewigged and bewhiskered features were until late last year seen in the House of Commons, where he was clerk and chief executive and sat in front of the Speaker John Bercow.
He has chosen Lisvane as his title from the city of his birth, having satisfied Garter King of Arms of his links to that northern suburb of Cardiff.
Lord Lisvane is descended on his mother's side from the Cardiff construction company E Turner and Sons, who built, among other things, City Hall and Cardiff Royal Infirmary. You may recognise a family resemblance in this painting which hangs in City Hall.
The firm also built a rather smart family home in Lisvane that was on the market last year for Â£3m.
Ty Gwyn passed through the Turners to the Reardon Smiths and then Julian Hodge - a family tree of notable Cardiff names. Lord Lisvane lives in Herefordshire now but chose to reflect his upbringing in his title.
In his former Commons role, he is said to have clashed with John Bercow.
It was noticeable how he was introduced into the Lords by former Commons Speaker Baroness Boothroyd and how many MPs made the short journey to watch him take his seat from the steps of the throne.
