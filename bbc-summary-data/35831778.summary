Feeney, 29, who has five goals in 41 games for the Trotters this term, is in the squad for Saturday's home match against Rotherham United.
Under the terms of the deal he will be available for any potential play-off fixtures for eighth-placed Ipswich.
"I'm really excited and glad it's done now," Feeney told the Ipswich website.
The Londoner, who lists Bournemouth and Millwall among his former clubs, swaps the battle against relegation with Bolton for a play-off push.
Town are a point outside the play-off places, with 11 games to play.
