Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has been fined £900,000 after a worker lost his leg in a car accident.

A delivery driver lost control of a car and crashed into another car causing a four-car shunt at its Solihull plant, the Health and Safety Executive said.
The worker became trapped between two cars as he crossed a production line, causing severe injuries. Two more people were also hurt.
JLR was found guilty of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act.
Two other workers suffered minor injuries in the incident.

Birmingham Crown Court heard the car-maker has since introduced a buffer zone to reduce the risk of a similar accident.
In a statement issued after the trial the HSE said JLR had failed to ensure the delivery driver, who was covering the shift, was familiar with normal procedures.
The firm had also failed to separate workers on the production line.
HSE inspector John Glynn said the "life-changing injuries" suffered by the worker were "completely avoidable".
"It was only good fortune that prevented this from being a fatal accident," he said.
As well as the fine, the company - whose headquarters are based in Coventry - also had to pay £49,868 costs.
A JLR spokesman said the company accepts the decision, adding it is "committed to the safety and well-being of all employees".
