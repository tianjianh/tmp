Brora in Sutherland is holding its first scarecrow festival. The week-long event started at the weekend.
Deirdre Mackay, Highland Council's area leader Caithness and Sutherland, said gardeners, shops, sports clubs and businesses were taking part.
A competition to find the best of the scarecrows will be judged this Saturday.
Ms Mackay said the various characters included a traffic police officer with a hairdryer for a speed gun.
