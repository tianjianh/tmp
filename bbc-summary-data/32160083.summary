Gertrude Weaver was born in 1898 and lives in a nursing home in the city of Camden.
She celebrates her birthday on 4 July, but it's unclear whether she was born on this date as there's no record.
Ms Weaver is a fan of President Barack Obama and she's hoping he'll join her to celebrate her 117th birthday.
In an interview with CBS, Ms Weaver said her secrets were trust in the Lord, working hard, and loving everyone you meet.
She's outlived all but one of her four children, Joe, who turns 94 this month. He visits regularly along with other family members and friends.
The announcement comes after the previous record holder, Misao Okawa from Japan, died a few weeks after her 117th birthday.
Ms Weaver has a few years to go to beat the oldest person ever to have lived - Jeanne Calment from France lived until she was 122 years and 164 days old.
