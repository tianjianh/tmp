Police are investigating the death of a six-year-old boy in Londonderry.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donnacadh McGuire was found with significant injuries in Tyrconnell Street shortly before 10:30 BST on Tuesday.
He was taken to hospital, where he later died. A man has been arrested and released on bail.
The police said it was "possible" that the boy's injuries "were sustained as the result of a collision with a vehicle".
However, the PSNI added:  "We are working to establish exactly what happened and we are keen to speak to witnesses".
Insp O'Brien said:  "I would ask anyone who was on Tyrconnell Street this morning between 10am and 10.30am to please get in touch."
Fr Paul Farren, a priest at St Eugene's Cathedral, has been speaking to the boy's family.
"It is just unspeakable. The loss of a child at such a young age is the most awful tragedy.
"Words are meaningless at a time like this."
Lorraine McGoldrick, who is a neighbour, arrived at the scene shortly after the incident.
"It is so tragic. People were in shock and everybody was speechless.
"The people here are amazing and they will support everybody."
