The company's chief Elon Musk said people would eventually be able to summon their cars to pick them up even if they were in a different city at the time.
At the moment the feature can only be used to drive the car in and out of a garage without a driver.
The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones met with Mr Musk at Tesla's design studio near Los Angeles.
