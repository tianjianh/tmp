Scarlets have signed former Springboks prop Werner Kruger on a three-year contract from next season.

The Bulls forward, 31, has made 113 Super Rugby appearances, and played four times for South Africa in 2011-12.
His signing follows Tuesday's announcement that Wales tight-head Rhodri Jones will leave Scarlets for Ospreys at the end of the season.
"Werner will further strengthen us at the set piece and will bring vast experience," said coach Wayne Pivac.
Scarlets rugby manager Jon Daniels said the move for Kruger was made quickly following Jones' decision to leave.
"Having been informed that Rhodri had made a decision to leave the Scarlets at the end of the season, it was imperative that we recruited quality in that position to support the other tight-heads in the squad," he said.
Kruger is the second South African to sign for the Llanelli-based region in a week, following the announcement of lock David Bulbring's arrival.
Both signatures are intended to strengthen the pack to support an exciting-looking back division taking shape for next season.
Wales and British and Irish Lions centre Jonathan Davies is returning from Clermont Auvergne, and will partner Wales international Scott Williams, who has missed most of this season with a knee injury.
In addition, Cardiff Blues' Wales international Rhys Patchell is joining with a view to establishing himself as a fly-half after spending a lot of time at full-back in the Arms Park.
