Exeter City winger Lee Holmes is set to miss much of the rest of the season after damaging ankle ligaments.

The 29-year-old will need surgery after being injured in a collision with goalkeeper Artur Krysiak in the Boxing Day draw at Yeovil Town.
Holmes, who has scored five goals in 16 games this season, will have an operation on Tuesday.
"He will be a huge loss to the side and he is expected to be out for some time," Exeter boss Paul Tisdale said.
"We are harbouring hopes that he will be able to return to training and continue his rehab for him to be able to compete again this season."

Exeter have taken 17 points from the last 21 and are up into 11th place in League Two after Monday's 4-0 win over Leyton Orient - leading Tisdale to be nominated for the League Two Manager of the Month award.
It was their biggest victory margin since an identical result against Orient in the corresponding fixture in September 2015.
"I'm really happy and not surprised by the form we've got, but it's great to have that result," Tisdale told BBC Radio Devon
"The goals are a product of the performance and the positional play and robust nature with which we played.
"It's been the case over the last month. It's no surprise when you get your squad back together again. We've got one or two out but we've got a strong squad, the bench looked strong, the spine of the team was good."
