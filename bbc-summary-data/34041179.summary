The 24-year-old forward, who came through Bristol's academy set-up, played against Warriors for their chief promotion rivals in all four of last season's Championship meetings.
He becomes Dean Ryan's 10th new signing ahead of the 2015-16 season.
There may be another one to follow as Springbok centre Wynand Olivier is reportedly to sign on a two-year deal following his release by Montpellier.
"Marco is a hungry young player who we saw plenty of at Bristol last season," said Warriors director of rugby Ryan. "We were really impressed with his performances in the Championship.
"We will work with him to ensure he transfers those skills into the Premiership. His versatility and work-rate across the back-row will add to the competitive nature of our squad."
Mama added: "I'm very excited to have an opportunity to play Premiership rugby at a club that clearly has so much ambition. The club has a first-class environment for players to develop, which is vitally important when having ambitions to play at the highest level.
"I believe my skill-set will be well-suited to Warriors. I hope I can make a significant impact. Competition is strong in the back row so I'm going to have to be at the top of my game to force my way into Dean's plans."
