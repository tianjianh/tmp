Hammond's treble, plus tries from Val Rapava Ruskin and Sam Betty, gave Warriors a 35-7 half-time lead.
Further scores followed through Ben Howard, a penalty try which saw Enisei wing Igor Kurashov sent off, Sam Ripper-Smith and Max Stelling.
Mikhail Gachechiladze and Valeri Morozov scored the Russians' tries.
Kurashov was shown the red card 12 minutes from the end for illegally knocking the ball out of Hammond's hands as the Worcester wing threatened a fourth try.
Worcester's victory means they climb above Enisei to finish third in Pool Three.
