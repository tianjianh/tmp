Traveller Sally Bowers said the site in Coverack, Cornwall, had become "our home" and she had "nowhere else to go".
Leaseholders St Keverne Parish Council declined to comment but confirmed it had served an eviction notice.
It said last year up to 25 parking spaces would be freed if the travellers were relocated.
It also "strongly supports" a plan to build a travellers' site on Goonhilly Downs.
Ms Bowers said she had applied to Cornwall Council, which owns the land, for a certificate of lawfulness to prove she does not need permission to station several caravans at the site.
The authority said it had not yet reached a decision on whether to grant the certificate and confirmed it "does not currently have an alternative site" to offer the family.
It added its previous position had been "to temporarily tolerate the use of the site" until an alternative could be provided.
The parish council said the proposed Goonhilly Downs site would "accommodate this particular family" and solve "this ongoing blight".
Ms Bowers' 18-year-old son, Elwood, said it was one of the "better" places he had lived, having previously resided at a gravel pit and a dump.
"I think I am resourceful because of it, I'm happy to work and have worked in the village since I was 15," he said.
Ms Bowers said she had not intended to stay at the site so long.
"This has been our home for over ten years and we have tried to make the best of it we could," she added,
Planning permission has not yet been granted for the new travellers' site.
