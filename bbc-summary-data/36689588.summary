Bristol Zoo's C-section baby gorilla can be 'very stroppy'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A baby gorilla born in a C-section operation at Bristol Zoo is now 20 weeks old and according to her keepers can be "very stroppy".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Western Lowland gorilla was born early in February after her mother showed signs of the potentially dangerous condition pre-eclampsia.
She was named Afia and has just cut her eighth tooth, with her favourite foods being avocado and steamed sweet potato.
Her keepers say she is "extremely determined with a strong personality".
