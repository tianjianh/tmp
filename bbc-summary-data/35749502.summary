[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales head coach Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team to face England in Saturday's key Six Nations match at Twickenham.

Gareth Davies retains the scrum-half spot ahead of Rhys Webb, who is named among the replacements.
Webb, 27, was recalled to the squad after six months away from international rugby with injury.
Lock Luke Charteris is on the bench where Paul James comes in to cover the injured loose-head Gethin Jenkins.
"We've named a pretty experienced side for Saturday," said Gatland.
"We have a couple of guys back from injury on the bench, Luke Charteris, Paul James and Rhys Webb and that is a bonus.
"There is a huge amount to play for on Saturday and it will go a long way to deciding the Six Nations.
"It's great to have Rhys back in the squad.  He has been training really hard and brings a lot of energy and experience to the team."
Webb made his comeback from injury for Ospreys in mid-February and has not played for Wales since injuring a foot against Italy in September which led to him missing the World Cup.
Davies took his place at the tournament and scored a crucial try when Wales beat England 28-25 at Twickenham.
Charteris played in the opening two games of Six Nations campaign, but missed the 19-10 win over France with a knee injury and resumed training on Monday.
Record cap holder Jenkins suffered a calf strain against France so will not add to his 122 Wales appearances.
Both teams are unbeaten going into Saturday's match, with England boasting a 100% record under new coach Eddie Jones in pursuit of their first Grand Slam since 2003.
Wales have beaten Scotland and France after drawing 16-16 with Ireland in their opening game.
Wales Team: Liam Williams; Alex Cuthbert, Jonathan Davies, Jamie Roberts, George North; Dan Biggar, Gareth Davies; Rob Evans, Scott Baldwin, Samson Lee, Bradley Davies, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton (capt), Taulupe Faletau.
Replacements: Ken Owens, Paul James, Tomas Francis, Luke Charteris, Justin Tipuric, Rhys Webb, Rhys Priestland, Gareth Anscombe.
