Tunisia Defender Zied Boughattas opened the scoring for the hosts on the stroke of half-time and Ihab Msakni added the second in the 65th minute.
The second leg of that tie is on 18 May in Gabon, with the overall winners progressing to group stage of the tournament.
Earlier on Friday it ended 0-0 between Al Ahly Tripoli and Misr Elmaqasah of Egypt, that games was played in Tunis because of the ongoing security concerns in Libya.
The tie will now be decided on 17 May in Egypt.
Etoile and Al Ahly Tripoli had begun the 2016 season in the African Champions League, the most prestigious and richest club event on the African calendar alongside TP Mazembe of the DR Congo.
Reigning African champions Mazembe fell by two goals away to Wydad Casablanca and were held at home with the Moroccans equalising in stoppage time.
Etoile and Mazembe have won nine Confederation of African Football titles each, achievements surpassed only by Al Ahly of Egypt with 18 triumphs.
The silver lining for Etoile is demotion to the Confederation Cup gives them a chance to win the competition twice in a row after beating Orlando Pirates of South Africa in the final last year.
Brazilian striker Diogo Acosta has been in good form for the Red Devils from Mediterranean resort Sousse.
If Etoile can close the gaps exposed by Enyimba in Nigeria they should build a lead at home to surprise qualifiers Mounana of Gabon.
Recently-appointed Mazembe coach Hubert Velud has appealed for patience from supporters disenchanted by failure to reach the Champions League group stage.
"I just got here," he said, referring to his arrival this year after the contract of fellow French coach Patrice Carteron was not renewed.
"Mazembe want to win trophies every year and we have the Confederation Cup in our sights now."
The club from Congolese mining city Lubumbashi have been goal shy lately, sorely missing Tanzanian striker Mbwana Aly Samatta, who moved to Belgium.
Ghanaian Daniel Nii Adjei showed signs of inheriting the leading scorer role, but has lacked consistency.
Mazembe host Stade Gabesien, a Tunisian outfit competing in Africa for the first time and unbeaten in qualifying tor the play-offs with two victories and four draws.
Hichem Essifi, the striker Tunisians call 'The Hulk' because of his imposing physique, will warrant special attention from the Congolese.
Three days after winning the South African title a record-extending seventh time, Mamelodi Sundowns face Medeama of Ghana near Pretoria.
Sundowns goalkeeper Denis Onyango told BBC Sport: "We have to switch our minds to a new focus and concentrate, we know we want the club wants which is to conquer Africa and that's what we have to think about.
"First we have to get to the group stage. But is a dream for the club and the players to conquer Africa and to make history - we know we have an opportunity to do it.
"We know we are playing a good team and we must give our best. We are taking it very seriously. If we can win 3-0 at home that would be fantastic."
Young Africans must shackle leading Confederation Cup scorer Arsenio 'Love' Cabungula from Angolan club Esperanca Sagrada in Dar es Salaam if they hope to become the first Tanzanian team to reach the group stage.
The match between Stade Malien of Mali and FUS Rabat of Morocco pits former Confederation Cup title-holders against each other in Bamako.
Mouloudia Bejaia of Algeria against Esperance of Tunisia and Al Merrikh of Sudan against Kawkab Marrakech of Morocco complete the first-leg schedule.
