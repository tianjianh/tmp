Pictures have emerged of a plane with its doors apparently blown off at an airport where loud "booms" have been reported.

Witnesses reported "a massive bang and a flash" on Tuesday evening at Cotswold Airport near Kemble.
The plane, with possible explosion damage, was moved afterwards.
Gloucestershire Constabulary said there had been "explosive training" at the airport but would not confirm whether the plane was involved.
The booms, heard from Kington St Michael to Malmesbury and Calne in Wiltshire, sparked calls to BBC Wiltshire and BBC Radio Gloucestershire as well as dozens of posts on social media.
Pilot and fight instructor Paul Shanley, 51, who lives just outside the village of Kemble said they had heard similar booms "three times before this but we've never got to the bottom of what it was".
"There was an enormous explosion - really deep explosion - it was enough to wake up my daughter," he said.
Mr Shanley said he took photos of a 747 on the runway which had "not normal damage" to its doors.
He said: "You can see the explosives around the door frame."
A police spokesperson said: "I'm afraid we cannot confirm whether this is connected to the explosions heard in Kemble, due to the operationally sensitive nature of the training."
