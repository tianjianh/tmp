County Championship: Trescothick and Rogers star as Yorkshire suffer at Taunton

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Somerset's batsmen made good use of a fine day and another fine track at Taunton as they dominated against county champions Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A 148-run second-wicket stand between ex-home skipper Marcus Trescothick and current captain Chris Rogers was the cornerstone of the hosts' 342-4.
Both went short of a ton, Trescothick for 97 and Rogers for 91.
But James Hildreth was still there at stumps on 68, aided by Jim Allenby's 51 on a day when just four wickets fell.
After play finished bang on time at 18:00 BST, with 96 overs bowled in the day, Somerset will resume in the morning needing 58 runs from 14 overs to gain maximum batting points.
A large crowd was there to witness Yorkshire electing to bowl first in warm sunshine on a dry-looking pitch - and the visitors were made to pay.
England leg spinner Adil Rashid, who was not introduced until the 50th over, came on to claim the wickets of both Trescothick, in only his second over, and Rogers, with a googly.
But there was little in the pitch for the Yorkshire seamers, who managed only one breakthrough in the morning session. when Tom Abell was bowled between bat and pad by a ball that nipped back from Steve Patterson.
