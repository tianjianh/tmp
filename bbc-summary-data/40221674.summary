Right-back Hodgkiss, 30, who spent last season on loan at Torquay, has signed a two-year contract.
Forward Wilson, 24, has agreed a one-year contract.
Meanwhile, George Pilkington has signed a new one-year contract, while David Fitzpatrick has also agreed a deal with the National League club.
The announcement comes after Macclesfield, who finished ninth last season, lost defender John McCombe to Chester and midfielder Ollie Norburn to Tranmere.
Askey, who is in his second spell with the club, having also managed the Silkmen between 2003 and 2004, has extended his stay for another season.
"John's loyalty to the club, in a number of roles, is unrivalled and we continue to progress under his leadership," Macclesfield chairman Mark Blower told the club website.
