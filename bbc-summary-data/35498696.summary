[SN]TITLE[SN]
American football's NFL to make sure women get interviews

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The NFL will introduce a rule to require teams to interview female candidates for "executive positions".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows the Rooney Rule, established in 2003, which requires NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coaching or senior football operation jobs.
Jen Welter was a member of the Arizona Cardinals coaching staff in pre-season, while Kathryn Smith recently became the first full-time female coach with an NFL team when she was hired by the Buffalo Bills.
At boardroom level, Katie Blackburn is the long-serving executive vice-president of the Cincinnati Bengals, while Amy Trask was the Oakland Raiders' chief executive officer from 1997 until 2013.
There is also a female game official - Sarah Thomas - in the NFL.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking at the league's Women's Summit in the build-up to Super Bowl 50, said: "We believe in diversity. We believe that we're better as an organisation when we have good people at the table."
