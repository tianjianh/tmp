David Crompton: Move to dismiss South Yorkshire police chief 'unfair'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The decision to dismiss the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police after the Hillsborough inquests was "unfair", a police chief has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Crompton was suspended by the Police and Crime Commissioner over fears about public trust in the force.
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Sir Tom Winsor said the decision was "disproportionate" and he should be reinstated, the BBC understands.
Mr Crompton is expected to appear before a Police and Crime Panel later.
Sir Tom's comments were made in a document seen by Channel 4 News.

He said the decision was "conspicuously unfair, disproportionate and so unreasonable that I cannot understand how the PCC (police and crime commissioner) has reached this view".
Mr Crompton was criticised by the families of the 96 football fans who died in the Hillsborough disaster over the stance taken by police lawyers during the inquest, which concluded police conduct contributed to or caused the disaster.
Following the ruling, Mr Crompton reiterated an apology for the tragedy and said he accepted the findings of the inquest.
Sir Tom said the apology had not been an attempt to justify the actions of South Yorkshire Police but to put it in to "context".
He said Mr Crompton's comments could not "rationally" be interpreted as Mr Crompton was "refusing to accept the verdict of the jury or rescinding the full apology already made".
Sir Tom was required to give his views on the situation as part of dismissal proceedings.
South Yorkshire PCC Dr Alan Billings said he was "disappointed" Sir Tom's comments had been made available but was unable to comment further.
The Police and Crime Panel, which will meet in private at 13:00 BST, will be asked to consider Dr Billings' decision to dismiss Mr Crompton.
Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, described the conduct of the force during the inquests as "completely unacceptable" and said Mr Crompton "must be held responsible".
