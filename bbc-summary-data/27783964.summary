Investigators are studying online videos left behind by a couple who shot and killed three people in Las Vegas, including two officers.

In one video, Jerad Miller, 31, stares at the camera and says "What better way to kill and rape, after all, if you're wearing a badge"
Miller and his wife Amanda, 22, turned their weapons on themselves after targeting the police.
But investigators believe the choice of Alyn Beck and Igor Soldo was random.
A third man, Joseph Wilcox, tried to confront the couple with a concealed firearm inside a Walmart but was shot and killed by Amanda Miller, according to police.
Officials are trying to fully understand the motive for the shootings but have said they know the couple shared an ideology with "militia and white supremacists", including that law enforcement was the "oppressor".
Police have also said they believe the material with a swastika printed on it left over one of the police officers was intended to paint police as Nazis.
Jerad Miller left a trail of online video and social media posts describing his political views and potential motivation for the shooting.
In one video, his face is painted to look like the Batman villain, The Joker, a costume he reportedly dressed in several times, along with his wife dressed as another comic book villain.
"When law enforcement and government are the criminals, they will fear an armed and educated people," he says. In another video, Miller warns police cannot be trusted.
The videos were posted in 2012, months before the couple were married.
Officials believe the pair came to Las Vegas in January, but attempted to join a protest of armed supporters of Cliven Bundy months later, a Nevada rancher in a long-standing dispute against the US Bureau of Land Management over cattle grazing fees.
The Millers were kicked off the ranch after a few days, according to Ammon Bundy, one of the rancher's sons.
"They were very radical, you know, and did not align themselves with the reason that the protesters were there," he said. "Not very many people were asked to leave. I think they may have been the only ones."
Officials do not believe the shooting was part of a broader conspiracy, despite Miller shouting "This is a revolution" as they opened fire, but on Monday, Sheriff Doug Gillespie said he was pairing officers together for safety.
About 100 people attended a candlelight vigil for the deceased officers on Monday night, local media reported.
