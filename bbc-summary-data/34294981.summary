[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union members have protested against plans to stop extra payments to weekend and bank holiday staff.
National Museum Wales said on Friday the union will now consult members over its offer to compensate weekend staff.
Planned strikes over the next two weeks, including next Tuesday and Wednesday, will be suspended, it added.
The news comes after three months of negotiations, most recently via the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
In August, strikes hit six of National Museum Wales' sites, including Swansea's National Waterfront Museum, the National Slate Museum in Llanberis, Gwynedd, and the National Wool Museum, Dre-fach Felindre, Carmarthenshire.
