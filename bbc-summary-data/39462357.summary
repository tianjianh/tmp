Aberdeen: Defender Andrew Considine wants no let-up from Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hat-trick hero Andrew Considine insists there is no chance of in-form Aberdeen taking their foot off the gas in the remaining weeks of the season.

The defender hit a treble as the Dons, who are second in the Premiership, won 7-0 at Dundee to increase their lead over third-placed Rangers to 11 points.
"We have the upper hand but a lot can change in football, I've seen it a lot over the seasons," Considine said.
"We can't let up, we have to keep chasing this second spot."
Derek McInnes' side were in devastating form at Dens Park on Friday night, with a Considine double and goals from Adam Rooney and Kenny McLean giving them a 4-0 lead at half-time.
Ryan Jack and Niall McGinn increased their advantage before defender Considine completed the first hat-trick of his career.
The result also ensured Celtic's title celebrations will have to wait until at least Sunday, when they face Hearts at Tynecastle.
Considine was, however, only concerned with his own side's display.
"The boys were terrific, they were getting in their faces and the intensity was incredible," Considine, who turns 30 on Saturday, told BBC Scotland.
"Even though we were four up at half-time we kept going in the second half and that shows the confidence the manager has installed in the team. A lot of folk thought because of the international break things might change but the manager has made sure we're on the ball.
"It's a fantastic 30th birthday to score a hat-trick, it's another one ticked off the list."

Delighted Dons manager Derek McInnes echoed Considine's sentiments.
"For us to produce a performance at this stage of the season says everything about them (the players)," he told BBC Scotland.
"It shows you how determined they are, how focused they are. You don't get to enjoy too many nights like that in your managerial career. We look like a team that has benefited from the winter and international breaks.
"You know it's a good night when Andrew Considine has got a hat-trick. The fans sang two different songs for him tonight. He could have had four, he missed a free header."
Dundee manager Paul Hartley had harsh words for his below-par players.
"I'm extremely disappointed at the performance tonight," he said. "They've let themselves down, they've let the club down and they've let the supporters down.
"We know the preparation was good but we were so off the pace it was unbelievable. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. Every individual was off their game.
"We had some words after the game but I gathered my staff to talk through things, where we go from here and how we galvanise the players for a massive game on Tuesday (against Ross County). The onus is on the players to perform on Tuesday."
