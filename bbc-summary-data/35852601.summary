Comber-based TG Eakin Limited exports its products to more than 40 countries.
The company said the new posts would pay "well in excess of the average Northern Ireland salary".
The new extension, if given the go-ahead by Ards and North Down Council, would be the firm's  second increase in floor space in as many years.
"We want to continue to invest in our premises at Ballystockart and bring jobs to the area," said managing director Jeremy Eakin.
"We need to recruit highly-skilled people in areas such as research and development, global sales and engineering."
TG Eakin Limited currently employs more than 70 people.
