Sheffield boxer Adam Etches says he is amazed at the response to his appeal to raise money for Nick Blackwell through a crowdfunding website.

Blackwell remains in an induced coma after Saturday's British middleweight title defeat by Chris Eubank Jr.
Fellow middleweight Etches set up the fundraising web page on Monday and more than £4,000 of the £10,000 target was raised in the first 24 hours.
"Nick is more of a rival to me than a friend," Etches told BBC Wiltshire.
"But never once has he been disrespectful. He's a nice kid. He's always polite, so 'why not?'
"It is brilliant that everyone is joining in. I don't want any credit for doing what I have done.
"The credit goes out to everyone that is doing it; boxers, fans and media are all showing their appreciation to Nick and support for his family."
Blackwell, 25, was found to have a small bleed on the brain after Saturday's fight.
The British Board of Boxing Control has said it was satisfied with how the bout was handled.
"Unfortunately, it is the dark side of the sport," Etches continued.
"The most important thing is that he makes a full recovery, and I'm sure he will do.
"One day you could be thinking about fighting for a world title - the next day you might not be able to box again. It only comes to light when the accidents happen."
Etches began the fundraising with a £200 personal donation and more than 200 contributions have followed.
"There is only big money in boxing at the top, if you're world champion," Etches continued.
"On your way up, it's a hard world. Nick knows that and every other boxer knows that and I think that is why boxers have come together and donated a small amount of money each."
