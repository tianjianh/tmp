Indiana state police found Kevin Bell, 39, along a US road three days after he and his girlfriend, Nikki K Reed, lost control of the car and struck a tree.
Ms Reed, 37, died in the crash and Mr Bell sustained leg injuries that had prevented him from seeking help.
The couple had been reported missing by Ms Reed's family.
Family members said that Ms Reed, a mother of three, had been expected to return home from a trip to Dover, Pennsylvania, where she had picked up Mr Bell.
She was last heard from on her trip back to Seymour, Indiana, on Saturday. Mr Bell's family had also been unable to reach him since Saturday.
Kristie Bevers, Ms Reed's friend, said she missed a call from her on Saturday morning.
"It bothers me because I could've talked to her. I could've heard her voice one more time," Ms Bevers said.
Mr Bell appeared to lose control of the car, which slid down an embankment and struck a tree, killing Ms Reed.
He managed to crawl to a road three days after the accident and was taken to hospital. His injuries are not believed to be life threatening, police said.
