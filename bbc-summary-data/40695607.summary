[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Specially-trained prison security teams arrived at the prison near Redditch in Worcestershire late on Saturday night.
The Prison Service said a "small number" of inmates at the category B jail were involved in the disturbance.
Prison authorities are now back in full control of the affected wing and the matter has been referred to West Mercia Police.
Men shouting and swearing, as well as banging and dogs barking, could be heard coming from the prison.
Specialist security squads, equipped to deal with riots, arrived at the site in unmarked vans at about 19:30 BST.
HMP Hewell is surrounded by farmland and houses about 1,000 inmates - including some category A remand prisoners.
In an inspection report published in January, Hewell was described as "a prison with many challenges and areas of serious concern".
Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said the "main concerns" were regarding "issues of safety and respect".
He said levels of violence were "far too high", communal areas were "dirty" and many cells were overcrowded.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "We are absolutely clear that offenders who behave in this way will be punished and face spending extra time behind bars."
