The striker, 24, has scored 17 goals this season, helping the Dingwall side to fourth in the Premiership and into the League Cup final.
The Northern Irishman moved to the Highlanders in the summer of 2014.
"It's a hugely significant piece of business. Liam Boyce is a huge player for us," Ross County manager Jim McIntyre told BBC Scotland.
"He enjoys the set-up here and it's good for him to earn that contract extension.
"When you've scored 17 goals in 24 games you're going to have suitors so it was important to get him signed up."
He has been capped six time for his national side, making his debut against Scotland in February 2011.
