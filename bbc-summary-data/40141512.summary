[SN]TITLE[SN]
Scotland v England

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths is fit to face England as Scotland host the Group F leaders in Saturday's World Cup qualifier at Hampden Park.

Griffiths sat out training on Monday, but assistant manager Mark McGhee said he has since returned and that Gordon Strachan has a fully-fit squad.
Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy pulled out of the England squad with a "minor injury" picked up in training.
Tottenham forward Harry Kane will captain England for the first time.
Scotland, fourth in the six-team Group F, are six points behind unbeaten leaders England with five games remaining.
McGhee said earlier this week that they have not given up hope of topping the group, but to do so they must end a run of three defeats against England.
Strachan's side, who have won two of their opening five games, are more realistically hoping to be one of the runners-up who will go into the qualification play-offs.
However, the head coach believes his side are capable of ending the Three Lions' long run without losing a qualification fixture.
Strachan is almost certain to continue with one striker, with the choice likely to be between Griffiths, who started November's 3-0 defeat at Wembley, or Derby County's Chris Martin, who scored in the 1-0 win over Slovenia in March.
"People say he's only playing one striker, but sometimes you play with three and two of them are wide," stressed Strachan.
"Playing with Steven Naismith and Shaun Maloney, they were strikers rather than midfielders playing wide."

Celtic left-back Kieran Tierney is likely to again be asked to switch to the right, as he did against Slovenia, despite Derby's Ikechi Anya being praised for his performance at Wembley.
Should he play, Tierney, who turned 20 on Monday, will play with a protective gum shield because a facial injury that forced him to be substituted in the Scottish Cup final win over Aberdeen.
"He just gets on with life and I think he's relishing every game," said Strachan. "At this moment, life is fantastic for him.
"When you see him off the training ground, he has a wonderful smile. But that smile has to be looked after during the training sessions, that's for sure."
England boss Gareth Southgate described the fixture with Scotland as "special" and believes Strachan's team will seriously test his players.
"Everybody is fit and available. I'm really pleased with the level of training and we'll have to transfer that into the game," added Southgate.
"The players have embraced some new ideas this week around how we want to work and we're looking forward to the game, it's a great one to be involved with.
"It's a special fixture, but the key objective is to qualify for the World Cup, so we've got to keep that in our mind.
"But it's a game that will test us in every way and that's what we should be looking forward to."
