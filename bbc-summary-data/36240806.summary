It was Cooke's second straight success in the sport's World Cup series after winning in Hungary last month.
Germany's Patrick Dogue was second behind the 25-year-old Briton, with Frenchman Valentin Prades third.
"It's been a perfect day," said Cooke, who was third after the swimming, fencing and riding but pulled himself up in the combined run and shoot.
Cooke's victory came just three months before the Rio Olympics get under way.
Compatriot Freyja Prentice finished sixth in the women's event.
