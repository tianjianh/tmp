[SN]TITLE[SN]
Ross County 1-2 Inverness CT

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Inverness continued their upsurge in form with first half strikes from Miles Storey and James Vincent securing a 2-1 Highland derby victory in Dingwall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Storey netted his fourth in five games when he calmly side-footed the opener.
He then broke down the left with superb pace, earning a corner from which Vincent nodded home at the back post.
County pressed in the second half and eventually broke through when Boyce headed home what proved to be a consolation in injury time.
The absence of in-form Ryan Christie was a talking point pre-match but Storey picked up the mantle and was a key architect of this win.
County started slightly better in an attacking sense and Michael Gardyne sent a great chance over from close-range after David Raven failed to deal with Boyce's centre.
As half-time approached the visitors decisively took the initiative. Liam Polworth's accurate centre found Storey breaking beyond the defence and he didn't hesitate in stroking the ball home.
Storey then turned superbly and skinned Scott Boyd to earn a corner. The ball was flicked into the path of Vincent at the back post and he nodded it in to give John Hughes' side a commanding lead.
The second half involved a pattern of County trying new ways to break down the visiting defence, with Inverness attempting to release Storey to utilise his exceptional speed.
Stewart Murdoch drove wide and headers from Boyce and Jackson Irvine didn't overly threaten.
The afternoon got worse for Jim McIntyre when his goalkeeper Scott Fox landed awkwardly on his left leg and had to be stretchered off.
Late hope arrived when Boyce once again marked his name on the scoresheet in injury time but it proved too late to mount serious pressure on the result.
Inverness can now rightly claim they're showing similar form to that of last season. A first defeat since mid-August for County points to a good start they'll be keen to maintain.
