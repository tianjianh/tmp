[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bolton Wanderers 2-1 Fleetwood Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Josh Vela ensured Bolton equalled their best start to a league season in 82 years with a late goal to complete a comeback 2-1 victory over Fleetwood at the Macron Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Midfielder Vela, linked with a possible switch to Championship neighbours Wigan, thumped in an 84th-minute right-foot effort after Gary Madine cancelled out David Ball's first-half opener.
Phil Parkinson's side have now won all four of their opening games while Vela's goal condemned Fleetwood to a first league defeat of the new campaign.
The only disappointment for Parkinson was a 30th-minute game-ending injury for striker Zach Clough.
Four minutes later the mood deepened as Ball punished a defensive howler by experienced defender Dean Moxey.
Wanderers, however, responded well in the second half as Madine levelled after 50 minutes.
Town keeper Chris Neal made a stunning double save to deny substitute Kaiyne Woolery and Mark Davies. But he had no chance as Vela scored the winner, though Victor Nirennold wasted a great opportunity to equalise deep in stoppage time.
