The bomb which hit Manhattan's Chelsea district in the evening injured 29.
Earlier on Saturday a pipe bomb exploded in a New Jersey shore town ahead of a charity race.
The FBI has been searching an address in Elizabeth, New Jersey, connected to the 28-year-old suspect.
A backpack containing up to five devices exploded in Elizabeth in the early hours of Monday when a bomb disposal robot tried to deactivate it.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said there were "certain commonalities" between the bombs.
New Jersey State Police said that the FBI was linking the Manhattan explosion and that in Seaside Park, New Jersey.
Investigators have warned that the suspect should be considered "armed and dangerous".
Millions of New York residents received a phone alert on Monday morning after the Notify NYC alert system was used to name the suspect.
"Anyone who sees this individual or knows anything about him or his whereabouts needs to call it in right away," New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on CNN.
Both the bomb that went off in New York on Saturday and an unexploded device found four blocks away were shrapnel-filled pressure cookers, according to US media.
Mr Cuomo said on Monday that there might be a foreign connection to the Manhattan attack. Officials had said over the weekend there were no confirmed links to international terrorist groups.
President Barack Obama, who is in New York for the United Nations General Assembly, is being kept up to date with the investigation, a White House spokesman said.
The backpack in New Jersey was found near the railway station in Elizabeth.
It was picked out of a bin by two men on Sunday evening, who thought the bag could contain something of value. They saw wires and notified police.
A police robot examining the bag early on Monday cut a wire causing it to explode. No-one was injured.
"That was not a controlled explosion," said Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage.
These are the attacks in the US over the weekend that caused security alerts:
