The 29-year-old's third album went straight to the top of the chart - which saw last week's number one artist, Paolo Nutini, fall to three.
Gary Barlow's Since I Saw You Last leapt 36 places to number two following the recent broadcast of his BBC documentary with James Corden.
Take That's greatest hits collection also re-entered the album chart at 21.
The Gary Barlow-effect was also seen in the singles chart, where the singer's track, Let Me Go, rocketed from 74 to 22.
Other new entries in the album chart's top 10 included Black Stone Cherry at five, with Magic Mountain, and Horrors' Luminous at six.
Anastacia's sixth studio album, Resurrection, also entered the chart at number nine.

In the singles chart, Dutch hip hop star Mr Probz returned to the top spot with his track Waves, after being knocked down last week to number two by Calvin Harris.
The Official Chart Company said the 29-year-old outsold Harris by more than 25,000.
Former chart topper Kiesza held firm at number three, with John Legend ballad All Of Me at four and Sigma's Nobody To Love at five.
There was only one new entry in the top 10 - Wild Wild Love by Pitbull featuring Grl.
UK Eurovision entrant Molly Smitten-Downes climbed up the chart from 48 to 33 with her track Children of the Universe.
The song, which finished 17th in the competition on Saturday, is the first UK Eurovision entry to enter the top 40 since Blue's I Can in 2011.
