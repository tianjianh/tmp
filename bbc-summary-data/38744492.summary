A rare arctic bird has been spotted hundreds of miles south of its normal habitat.

The white-billed diver - also known as the yellow-billed loon - normally winters along the north western coast of Norway.
The bird was spotted on the River Witham at Martin Dales, near Woodhall Spa, Lincolnshire, on Friday.
Since then, scores of bird watchers have visited the area trying to catch a glimpse of the juvenile bird.
Chris Andrews, from Frampton Marsh Nature Reserve, said at this time of year they are normally found offshore in the northern Pacific, or off the coast of Norway.
Sightings have previously been reported in the Shetland Islands.
However, Mr Andrews said: "It's a rare bird to see in Britain, and for it to wind up inland in Lincolnshire in the same place one was spotted 19 years ago is quite extraordinary.
"Usually, they are off shore about half a mile out to sea."
Mr Andrews said the bird - also known as a yellow-billed loon - because of the weird yodelling calls it makes - will return to its breeding ground at some point soon.
He said eventually its bill will change to a yellow colour - hence its other name.
Mr Andrews added the bird may have come so far south to escape stormy weather conditions.
A previous sighting of a white-billed diver on the River Witham was recorded in 1996, but the bird died after being caught by a pike fisherman, according to archives recorded by The Lincolnshire Bird Club.
One bird watcher, Jack Dawson, filmed this video of the bird at dawn on Saturday.
Photos of the bird have also appeared online.
