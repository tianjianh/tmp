The wreckage of the Piper Cherokee plane, which was travelling from Dundee to Tiree, has also been found.
A multi-agency search was launched after contact with the aircraft was lost at about 13:50 BST on Saturday.
Police Scotland said the wreckage was discovered on the northern aspect of Glen Kinglass around 20:00, along with the remains of the two people on board.
Chief Inspector Fergus Byrne said: "Specialist officers are at the scene and every effort is being made to recover the victims, investigate the circumstances then remove the wreckage of the plane.
"However, the area is very remote and the crash site extensive and as such it will take a considerable amount of time to complete our work.
"Inquiries are continuing to establish the exact circumstances and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal."
The police service, ambulance and coastguard had been involved in the search in the Loch Etive area, with the Oban lifeboat also being called out.
No further details of the two victims are being released at present, Police Scotland said.
