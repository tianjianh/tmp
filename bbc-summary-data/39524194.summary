Stephen O'Keefe: Australia spinner fined for 'inappropriate comments'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Spin bowler Stephen O'Keefe has been fined by Cricket Australia for making "highly inappropriate comments" while under the influence of alcohol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Keefe, 32, made the remarks at an end-of-season awards night in Sydney last week.
He was fined what Cricket Australia called a "strong penalty" of A$20,000 (Â£12,000; $15,000) because he had been involved in an earlier alcohol-related incident in August.
The comments have not been made public.
"There is no excuse for this and I take full responsibility and offer an unconditional apology," O'Keefe said in a statement.
He will also attend counselling.
O'Keefe took 19 wickets during Australia's recent four-Test series against India.
