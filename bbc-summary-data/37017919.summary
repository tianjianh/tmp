[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gillingham 1-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rory Donnelly's equaliser 19 minutes from time preserved Gillingham's unbeaten League One record after a 1-1 draw with Swindon at the Priestfield Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Substitute Donnelly fired home clinically from Ryan Jackson's low cross to cancel out Michael Doughty's earlier penalty.
Gills' Max Ehmer smashed a strike against the crossbar with just five minutes left, after Swindon were reduced to 10 men after Brandon Ormonde-Ottewill received a second booking.
In a game of few clear-cut opportunities, the visitors went ahead in the 55th minute after Darnell Furlong had been upended by Paul Konchesky.
QPR loanee Doughty confidently despatched the spot-kick to give Swindon the advantage against the run of play.
The home side shaded the opening 45 minutes and were unfortunate to not go into the break in front, with Emmanuel Osadebe and Jay Emmanuel-Thomas going close.
Jackson almost equalised for the Gills on the hour but his left-footed strike narrowly missed the target.
But the hosts grabbed a deserved equaliser in the 71st minute when Donnelly fired past Lawrence Vigouroux.
