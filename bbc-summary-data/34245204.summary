[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers stuck in a motorway traffic jam were treated to an impromptu "concert" by a string quartet.

The musicians were returning home after performing at a Cornish wedding when the M5 was brought to a standstill by a horse on the road near Tiverton, Devon.
Violinist Emma Waller, from Portishead, said it was an "impulse decision" to play Johann Pachelbel's Canon.
Helen Delingpole, from the Rhondda Valley, Wales, who captured the moment on her phone, said it was "fantastic".
Ms Delingpole was heading home on Saturday after spending a week in Devon and said the music had "really cheered everyone up".
"It was fantastic - I'm so glad I filmed it because I wanted the musicians to see it, they're stars," she said.
The quartet, comprising of violinists Emma Waller and Lu Jeffrey, from Portishead, cellist Alison Gillies, from Bristol, and viola player Craig Pecherek, from Gloucester, said they have been astounded by the reaction.
Ms Waller, who has performed for the Welsh National Opera orchestra, said: "It's a little bit crazy, we only did it as a bit of fun to entertain people and certainly not for publicity or self-promotion.
"We knew there hadn't been a serious accident because there was an animals on the road warning sign flashing and we could see the end of the traffic queue, so we thought, why not?
"Everyone looked bored so we joked 'shall we play something' - it was a bit of an impulse decision."
