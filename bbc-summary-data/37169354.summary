The animated Pixar film took a further £2.86m over the weekend, bringing its total UK takings to date to £32.4m.
Superhero film Suicide Squad was not far behind with £2.55m.
But both films outshone this week's highest new entry - Ricky Gervais' David Brent film - which debuted at number three with £1.46m.
The film sees Gervais return as Brent, the character he originally played in the hugely successful BBC sitcom The Office.
Jason Bourne took £1.26m to remain at number four, while The BFG was also a non-mover at five with £1.24m.
Three new entries entered in the lower half of the top 10 - with horror film Lights Out landing at six with £1.27m.
Swallows and Amazons, based on the children's novel of the same name, took £676,000 to debut at number eight.
Nine Lives, which sees a billionaire played by Kevin Spacey become trapped in the body of a cat, entered at number nine after taking £637,000.
