[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hearts held Rangers to a Scottish Premiership stalemate at Ibrox.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Souttar's strike came back off the hosts' crossbar before Rangers' Alfredo Morelos had a goal disallowed for offside.
Bruno Alves' header was cleared off the line and team-mate Kenny Miller was denied by Hearts keeper Jack Hamilton before the break.
Substitute Ryan Hardie saw his effort deflected over on a frustrating day for the home side.
It was a second match in succession without victory for Pedro Caixinha's side, who had lost at home to Hibernian last weekend.
Both teams were able to field players who had been red-carded last week, with Rangers' Ryan Jack and Hearts' Isma Goncalves having those dismissals rescinded.
Jamie Walker - the subject of failed bids by Rangers - also started for Hearts.
Souttar's drive from 30 yards rattled the frame of the Rangers goal and the defender soon made his presence felt in his own half.
Graham Dorrans played Josh Windass through on goal but Souttar's last-ditch tackle prevented the Englishman getting away a telling shot.
Alves' header from a Daniel Candeias corner was cleared off the Hearts goal line by Michael Smith and Morelos could not pounce on the rebound.
Morelos did find the net from a Lee Wallace pass, but the latter had been flagged offside.
Hamilton's reflex stop thwarted Miller and with no scoring in the early part of the second period, Caixinha sent on Niko Kranjcar in place of Windass.
Walker and Prince Buaben went off for Hearts, with Krystian Nowak and Connor Randall sent on by interim head coach Jon Daly.
Morelos fizzed a shot across the face of goal and Dorrans' replacement Hardie had the last significant attempt, his effort partially blocked and going off target late on.
Defender Rafal Grzelak's late introduction in place of Jamie Brandon helped keep the visitors' clean sheet intact, as they built on last week's win at Kilmarnock.
