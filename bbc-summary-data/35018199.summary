Chris Robshaw will meet with new England head coach Eddie Jones on Saturday night to discuss his international future.

The 29-year-old Harlequins back row was England captain throughout the reign of previous boss Stuart Lancaster.
It will be the first time the pair have met after Jones said a face-to-face meeting was a top priority, soon after his appointment on 20 November.
Jones watched Quins' Premiership win over London Irish on Saturday.
It was the first match he had attended since replacing Lancaster two weeks ago because of visa issues delaying the 55-year-old Australian's arrival.
Jones was flanked by Rugby Football Union chief executive Ian Ritchie and was present in the same executive box as Premiership Rugby supremo Mark McCafferty.
Jones was critical of Robshaw during England's recent poor World Cup campaign, stating in a newspaper column that "at international level he just doesn't have that point of difference", describing him as "workmanlike" and a "six-and-a-half at best".
But Quins director of rugby Conor O'Shea insisted Robshaw's international career was far from over following Saturday's 38-7 win.
"Chris is seeing Eddie for a coffee at some stage this evening," O'Shea said.
"Chris was outstanding against Irish, like he was against Exeter. I cannot speak more highly of him and what he has done for this club. There's a lot left in him."
He added Robshaw was in "a high profile position and will get criticism, but he deserves to be lauded for what he is rather than being pilloried because there are so many people in sport who aren't proper role models".
"Chris is a proper role model and a great rugby player. Hopefully he showed that to Eddie out there."
