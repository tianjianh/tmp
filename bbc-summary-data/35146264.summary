Martyn Ashton said the response was beyond his "wildest dreams".
The 41-year-old, from Margam, Neath Port Talbot is a former British and World Champion mountain bike trials rider.
Friends urged him to set up a crowd funding page after he tried to sell his Colango C59 bike worth £7,000.
The page was launched at 15:00 GMT on Saturday and by the same time on Sunday had raised £29,000.
Mr Ashton said: "It is fabulous and at this time of year it has a real Christmas feel. I'm a very lucky guy."
He was a well-respected professional stunt cyclist, with his videos Road Bike Party and Road Bike Party 2 gaining more than 28 million views between them on YouTube.
But he lost the use of his legs in an accident during a live show in 2013.
Since the accident at British Moto GP at Silverstone he said has received "incredible" treatment from the NHS, but he wanted to buy additional equipment and adapt his house.
He "quite reluctantly" set up the crowd funding page after friends told him not to sell his bike.
While he initially wanted to spend £7,000 on a hand bike or physiotherapy equipment to "stay fit in 2016", he said he would now rethink after raising £29,000.
"I'm very positive and enjoy the challenges of the life I have," he said.
"I think it's a bit crude to think of how to spend it yet, I'm just enjoying the response."
