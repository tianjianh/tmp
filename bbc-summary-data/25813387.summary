A triple killer was "ecstatic" when she saw news reports that she was wanted by police, her friend has told a jury.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joanna Dennehy, 31, has admitted stabbing three men and dumping their bodies in ditches in Cambridgeshire.
Giving evidence in the trial of Gary Stretch and Leslie Layton, who deny covering up the killings, Dennehy's friend Georgina Page said she "jumped around like a schoolgirl".
She added that Dennehy likened herself and Mr Stretch to "Bonnie and Clyde".
Dennehy, originally of Bifield, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, pleaded guilty in November to the murders of Lukasz Slaboszewski, John Chapman and Kevin Lee.
She stabbed all three men in the heart before dumping their bodies in the Cambridgeshire Fens in March and April last year.
She also admitted two attempted murders in Hereford.
Georgina Page told Cambridge Crown Court that Dennehy and Gary Stretch - whose real name is Gary Richards - made an unplanned visit to her home while they were being hunted by police.
While there, she said Dennehy saw an article on Teletext about the police appeal to find them.
Ms Page said Dennehy told her she had stabbed one of her victims when he came to use the toilet while she was in the bath.
When they left, Ms Page said she did not ring the police because she was terrified about what might happen to her.
Giving evidence about the Hereford stabbings, another witness, Mark Lloyd, said he was in the same car as Dennehy and Mr Stretch when Dennehy decided to attack people in the street.
He said Dennehy told Mr Stretch, who was driving the car, "I want my fun. I need you to get my fun".
Mr Lloyd said the car then stopped on a road, Dennehy got out and began stabbing a man who had been crossing the road.
The victim survived, but Mr Lloyd said Dennehy then went on to stab another man and took his dog.
Dennehy is currently in custody awaiting sentence. As well as admitting the Cambridgeshire murders, she has also pleaded guilty to preventing a lawful and decent burial for the three men and admitted the attempted murder of two men in Hereford.
Gary Richards, 47, of Riseholme, Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, denies three counts of preventing a lawful and decent burial and two counts of attempted murder in Hereford.
Leslie Layton, 36, of Bifield, Orton Goldhay, denies two counts of preventing a lawful and decent burial and one count of perverting the course of justice.
A third man, Robert Moore, 55, of Belvoir Way, Peterborough, has admitted assisting an offender and is also awaiting sentence.
The trial continues.
