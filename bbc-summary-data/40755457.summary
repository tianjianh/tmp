The 21-year-old has been at Chelsea since she was nine and spent last season on loan with Women's Super League 2 side Bristol City.
"I know a few of the girls already from playing with England and I have met a few of them as well. Everyone has made me feel really welcome," she said.
"I'm buzzing to start pre-season in August and meet the rest of them."
