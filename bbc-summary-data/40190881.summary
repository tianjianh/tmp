The baby, identified only as Child A, died in hospital in March 2015 after being found in a home strewn with dirty nappies and drug paraphernalia.
A significant case review said failures of communication led to deficiencies in the care of child protection services.
They said they were developing a plan in response to the review.
Despite prior involvement from social services in the city, when police officers arrived at the family home on the day of Child A's death, they expressed immediate concerns about the conditions she had been living in along with her siblings.
The review said: "They reported the home being in a state of disarray, dirty soiled clothing and nappies observed in rooms throughout the home, the bedroom occupied by two of the older siblings was stated to be uninhabitable with broken beds, no mattresses or bed clothes.
"Police further noted evidence of drug misuse within the property: scorched tinfoil on the floor and remnants of a plastic wrap believed to have contained heroin."
CCTV footage of the area also showed Child A's siblings being out at midnight without adult supervision.
A post-mortem examination of the child later concluded that she had died of sudden and unexplained death in infancy syndrome.
The review said that it was important to acknowledged that had there not been any issues with the intervention of care services, the outcome may have been the same for the child.
However, in its findings, the significant case review said there had been deficits in information sharing within and across agencies, which impacted on assessment, decision making, care planning and intervention with Child A and her family.
The review also highlighted changes of social service personnel at key times combined with staff absences reduced the opportunities to re-assess the child and family circumstances.
A spokesperson for the Glasgow Child Protection Committee said it was unable to publish the full report for legal reasons.
It added: "The significant case review process is clearly intended to give professionals the opportunity to learn from serious incidents and how best to improve services to protect children and young people.
"It is not an inquiry into culpability, which is a matter for criminal investigation or disciplinary procedures.
"Throughout the review process, the committee has welcomed the readiness of staff to reflect on this complex case and to identify shortcomings as well as good practice.
"The agencies involved are developing a plan in response to the findings of this review and this work will be subject to further scrutiny by the Child Protection Committee."
A spokesperson for the Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership said: "This has been an extremely sad and difficult case involving the tragic loss of a very young baby.
"We are addressing concerns raised in the findings of this review as a matter of priority.
"We want to ensure that our assessment processes are robust and that our systems deliver effective joint working.
"The Child Protection Committee is aware of good practice within our services but we must make sure this positive work is found consistently throughout our operation.
"The review also identifies that the impact of neglect presents a major challenge for all staff working with children in Glasgow.
"We are firmly focused on neglect as part of our work and what can be done to manage as effectively as possible the risks created by neglect.
"As the review acknowledges, however, even a flawless system may not have prevented this sudden unexpected death in infancy."
