[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Hannover have sacked coach Thomas Schaaf after just 11 matches in charge of the struggling Bundesliga side.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Schaaf, 54, was appointed during the mid-winter break but has since overseen one win and 10 defeats with Hannover 10 points from safety with six games left.
The club said former under-19 coach and ex-player Daniel Stendel, 41, would take over until the end of the season.
Schaaf was previously in charge of Werder Bremen for 14 years and last season was Eintracht Frankfurt boss.
