Robert Stehlik, 24, and Milos Bellan, 41, both from Slovakia, were arrested in Dover after arriving by ferry from Calais on 13 January.
A haul of weapons had already been seized by French Police, but the pair continued on to the UK while on bail.
They were both sentenced to 20 months in prison at Canterbury Crown Court.
A search of the pair's car by Border Force officers uncovered two cases of ammunition for a type of air gun - one containing CS gas cartridges and the other pepper spray.
The officers also found balaclavas and papers showing that French police had earlier seized weapons including two gas guns, two extendable batons, a flick knife and two Tasers.
The two men had been released on bail and continued their journey to the UK.
A spokesman for the National Crime Agency said: "Stehlik had set up a false Facebook account in order to befriend and track down the new boyfriend of Bellan's former partner.
"Photos of the girl and her new boyfriend, as well as pictures of his house and work were also on one of their phones."
Stehlik and Bellan had admitted charges of conspiring to possess an imitation firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.
As well as being jailed, the pair were given two-year restraining orders.
