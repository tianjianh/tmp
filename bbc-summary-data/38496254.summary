Dyfed Poultry Society said the annual Welsh National Poultry Weekend, due to run on 14-15 January in Haverfordwest, would not go ahead.
It comes after a wetland centre in Llanelli was temporarily shut following the finding of an infected duck.
Society chairman Alan Ralphs said the announcement was made with "real disappointment".
