Airlander 10 made 'higher than desired' approach before 'heavy landing'

A mooring line dangling from the world's longest aircraft meant it had to make a "higher than desired approach" to the airfield ahead of its "heavy landing" last month, it has been revealed.

The Â£25m Airlander 10 "nosedived" during its second test flight in Bedfordshire on 24 August.
Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) said the line dropped during a second take-off.
It said it was "certainly a factor" in the landing.
The 302ft (92m) long vehicle made a successful maiden flight last month from Cardington Airfield but sustained damage to the hull and cockpit on landing from its second flight.
A report submitted to the Air Accident Investigations Board (AAIB) by HAV technical director Mike Durham said the aircraft had first made a "successful landing" but there was an "issue with the mooring mast" which required the pilot to take-off a second time and circle the airfield while it was repaired.
It was during the second take-off that the 150ft (46m) nose mooring line dropped free and trailed beneath the aircraft.
"As a result of this, the pilot had to make a higher than desired approach to its second landing of the day to reduce the likelihood of the trailing line snagging on the fence or trees to the south of the airfield," the report said.
An HAV spokesman said: "[This] did mean we had to make a higher than desired approach, and this is certainly a factor in the heavy landing."
The report confirmed that while the mooring line had been in "contact" with a power cable, this had not contributed to the incident.
"The contact of the mooring line with the power cable happened a number of minutes before landing and in no way damaged the aircraft and did not contribute to the heavy landing," the spokesman said.
A full investigation into the incident and repair and testing of the aircraft is expected to take an estimated three to four months.
