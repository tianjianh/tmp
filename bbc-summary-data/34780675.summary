[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bradford and Keighley men charged with child sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Thirteen men and a 17-year-old boy have gone on trial charged with 28 sexual offences against an underage girl in West Yorkshire.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bradford Crown Court heard how "drug dealer" Arif Choudhury, who is not on trial, arranged meetings in Keighley in 2011 between the men and the girl.
The group, all from Keighley and Bradford, are said to have committed many offences in an underground car park in Keighley.
All deny the charges.
The jury heard the "vulnerable" girl, aged 13 and 14 at the time, lived a "chaotic existence".
She was exploited and used for sex which - as well as the underground car park - took place on a lane, behind a container and in parks in Keighley.
She was first raped in May 2011 after telling Mr Choudhury she wanted to stop delivering drugs.
He physically assaulted her and raped her in a churchyard, the court was told.
Michelle Colborne QC, prosecuting, said he then introduced her to other men who had sex with her.
"Some were equally nasty in their treatment," Ms Colborne said.
"One or two seemed to be ashamed after the event, but used her nevertheless."
Police found graffiti on the car park wall with her name and some defendants' names.
The court heard she began truanting from school and staying out at night at around the age of 12.
She was officially reported missing from home 71 times over two years and denied to police spending time with Asian men.
At one point she reported being raped but withdrew the allegation.
Ms Colborne said: "At times the girl said 'no', at times she struggled and at times she gave in without saying anything at all. At no times was she consenting to the act."
Ms Colborne said she was "out of her depth" but "too naive" to do anything about it.
Bradford Crown Court heard that on one occasion, aged 14, she was raped by five men.
The group deny 28 offences altogether.
Yasser Kabir, 25, of Belgrave Road, Keighley, denies four counts of rape.
Nazir Khan, 23, of Buxton Street, Keighley and Tauqeer Hussain, 23, of Belgrave Road, Keighley, deny three counts of rape.
Israr Ali, 19, of Devonshire Street West, Keighley, and Hussain Sardar, 19, and Saqib Younis, 29, both of Bradford Street, Lawkholme, Keighley, all deny two charges of rape.
Bilal Ziarab, 21, of Sedgwick Close, Manningham, Bradford, Sufyan Ziarab, 22, of Kendal Mellor Court, Keighley, and Zain Ali, 20, and Faisal Khan, 27, both of Buxton Street, Keighley, also all deny two charges of rape.
Rohail Iqbal, 22, of Skipton Road, Beechcliffe, Keighley, Rohail Hussain, 18, of Hawk Street, Lawkholme, Keighley and a 17-year-old youth all deny one count of rape.
Mohammed Akram, 62, of Holker Street, Keighley, denies one charge of sexual activity with a child under 16.
The trial continues.
