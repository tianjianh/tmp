Hundreds of people have taken part in a candlelit vigil led by the Bishop of Birmingham in sympathy with people affected by the attacks in Paris.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The gathering, outside the cathedral in St Philip's Square, included speeches from leaders of different faiths.
The Right Reverend David Urquhart said it was for "people of all faiths and none to join together in solidarity and reflection".
A minute's silence was also held as part of the ceremony.
The bishop said: "At times like this, the different faiths in Birmingham are able to show that we are united in our condemnation of these attacks and in our determination not to let events like this damage the good relations we have here in Birmingham."
Landmarks across the UK, including the Library of Birmingham, were illuminated in the colours of the French flag on Saturday night as a gesture of solidarity with those affected.
