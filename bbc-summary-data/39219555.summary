Paul Lambert's side ended ended a six-game losing run in all competitions when they drew 0-0 at Mick McCarthy's Ipswich Town on Tuesday.
They are just a point clear of trouble going into Saturday's key home game against bottom club Rotherham United.
But Marshall remains upbeat, telling BBC WM: "I'm sure we'll be all right."
Saturday's seemingly doomed Molineux visitors Rotherham are 19 points adrift of safety at the foot of the Championship table, having picked up just one away point out of a possible 54 this season.
"We've just got to keep believing," Marshall said. "I'm sure as soon as we get that win and get some confidence, we'll kick on.
"Team spirit is good. You go in the dressing room and you wouldn't think we are where we are.
"People can see the performances are there. We're just lacking someone to put the ball in the back of the net.
"We've now just got to take parts of our performance into Saturday," added Marshall, 25, who joined in January from Blackburn Rovers, now one of Wolves' main relegation rivals.
Ben Marshall was talking to BBC WM's Mike Taylor.
