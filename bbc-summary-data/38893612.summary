Steve Evans: Mansfield Town manager 'loving' life with Stags

Steve Evans says he is "loving" being Mansfield Town boss and has no regrets about dropping down to League Two.

Evans, who replaced Adam Murray as manager in November with the club in 18th, has taken the Stags to seventh and two points outside the play-offs.
The former Leeds United and Rotherham United boss said he had offers to manage at a higher level but was lured by the stability at Mansfield.
"I didn't want to go to a firefight," Evans, 54, told BBC Radio Nottingham.
"I wanted to go in somewhere that was really secure and somewhere that would back it. I am absolutely loving it."
Evans could have remained at Championship level and was also heavily linked with the then vacant managerial job at League One Charlton Athletic.
But he is convinced he made the correct decision despite dropping two divisions from his last role at Leeds.
Saturday's win over Barnet was their sixth in eight unbeaten matches since the 1-1 draw against Doncaster on New Year's Eve.
The Stags made eight signings in the January transfer window - something Evans said was vital if they wanted to challenge for promotion.
"We said we would organise the football club structurally and we needed support in the transfer window," he added.
"If we didn't change it in the transfer window we would probably be in a battle at the bottom. You are fortunate when a chairman gives you his blessing, but he also asked us to balance it.
"We have got eight out and eight out and probably levelled the money up from a business point of view. The chairman will be pleased because he has got a better product."
