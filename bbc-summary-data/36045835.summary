Joyce Ferder Rankin: Images from the end of the world

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Northern Ireland-based photographer has literally gone to the ends of the Earth to highlight the "inhumane" effects of climate change.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joyce Ferder Rankin travelled from the Arctic to Antarctica and back again over a four-year period from 2011 to 2015, capturing stunning polar images.
An exhibition of photographs from her journey has opened in Portstewart.
She decided to showcase "the beauty of what we are losing" rather than the ugly effects of human destruction.
The trip brought her up close and personal with polar bears - getting within 7ft (2.1m) of the fierce creatures to record their fight for survival on a shrinking hunting ground that is melting into the sea.
