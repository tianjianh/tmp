How to draw a dragon and other top tips

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The last How to Train Your Dragon book is out today and we caught up with author Cressida Cowell.

The twelfth and final book in the series is called "How to Fight A Dragon's Fury" and features the final battle between dragons and humans.
You've been sending in your brilliant questions for Cressida and we asked her who her favourite character from the series was, and if she is working on any new books.
She also showed Jenny how to draw the mischievous main characters from her series: Hiccup and Toothless.
There are lots of different species of dragon in Cressida's books, so we thought we'd find out what Newsround would be like.
As well as offering advice on writing, Cressida also explained the best way to illustrate your ideas.
