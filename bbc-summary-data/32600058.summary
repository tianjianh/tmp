[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has written a memoir about the 12 months he spent on bail, before being told he would not face charges over allegations of historic sex offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The BBC DJ said Love, Paul Gambaccini would be a "no-holds barred story".
Gambaccini, who was arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, recently claimed he was used as human "fly paper".
He had always denied claims of sex offences against two teenage boys in the early 1980s.
"When I was sitting in a jail cell waiting for a solicitor, I made myself three promises," said Gambaccini. "I would lose weight, become a better piano player and write a book about whatever was about to occur.
"I am glad to say I shed a stone, learned several of Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words and wrote Love, Paul Gambaccini."
The 66-year-old told a parliamentary committee in March that he believed his arrest was publicised by police in the hope that other people would come forward with allegations against him.
The DJ, who has been a fixture on UK radio for decades, only returned to the radio in November, having stepped down shortly after his arrest.
He said he forfeited more than Â£200,000 in lost earnings and legal costs during the time he was unable to work.
Gambaccini, whose book will be published in September, was told in October last year he would not face any charges.
The Operation Yewtree investigation into historic sex offences was launched by police following the exposure of Jimmy Savile's crimes.
