The first suitcase was found on Sunday by a man walking near Traunsee lake by the town of Gmunden. A police dog found the second suitcase on Monday.
Police said the body in the suitcases was probably that of a woman aged about 70.
Later on Monday, police announced they had found the body of a man. It is not clear whether the two are connected.
The male body was found at the bottom of the lake, a suitcase full of rock attached to a wrist, Austria's Kurier newspaper reports (in German).
Investigators are working to identify the victims and establish a cause of death. The process was being hampered in the case of the female victim by the lack of a complete set of remains, police said.
The walker who recovered the first case from the lake reported seeing a pair of hands and feet, local media say.
Gmunden lies about 80km (50 miles) east of Salzburg.
