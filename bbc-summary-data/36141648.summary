Ryan Lowe: Crewe boss Steve Davis sets up return of experienced former Alex striker

Crewe Alexandra could be close to bringing back striker Ryan Lowe back to Gresty Road when his current contract expires at League One rivals Bury this summer, reports BBC Radio Stoke.

The 37-year-old Liverpudlian, who first joined Crewe a decade ago, returned to the Alex on loan in November.
Boss Steve Davis hoped to make the move a more permanent one in January.
But it is understood a 'gentleman's agreement' has now been reached for Lowe to re-join relegated Crewe.
Davis first tried to bring the much-travelled marksman to Gresty Road when he first took over at Crewe four years ago.
And he hinted that the vastly experienced Lowe would not be the only 'old head' to be brought in this summer to strengthen his predominantly young side.
"The team's got a lot of potential," Davis told BBC Radio Stoke. "It's a very young squad. But they need to learn how to win. They need to find a way to win games.
"Old heads would certainly help in terms of situations within games. Those characters within the squad who have come into it this season could really help."
After starting at non-league Burscough, boyhood Liverpool fan Ryan Lowe did not make his Football League debut until he was almost 22.
He made his name with Shrewsbury Town as a winger before the first of two spells with Chester City, during which he went out on loan to Stockport, followed by moves to Crewe, Bury, Sheffield Wednesday, MK Dons, Tranmere Rovers and then back to Gigg Lane.
Ryan Lowe hit 17 goals in 74 games in two seasons at Gresty Road from 2006 to 2008. He then scored two more in six appearances - which included two of Crewe's six wins this season - when he returned on a six-week loan in November.
But he has been used a lot more by Bury since Christmas, adding four more goals to a career tally that reached 200 on Saturday when he netted in the Shakers' 3-1 home defeat by Millwall.
