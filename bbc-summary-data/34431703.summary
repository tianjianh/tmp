[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bristol Rovers 3-0 Wycombe Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Matt Taylor scored a 12-minute second-half hat-trick as Bristol Rovers moved up to 10th in League Two with victory over Wycombe.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 25-year-old striker scored the opener on the hour with a 20-yard strike, following a free-kick.
Stuart Sinclair's quick thinking from another free-kick led to Taylor firing in a second from just inside the area.
And Taylor scored his 13th of the season when he ran between two defenders to fire in from close range.
Wycombe Wanderers boss Gareth Ainsworth:
"We made two really bad mistakes for their last two goals. At 1-0 we were always in the game and we always had a chance.
"We didn't defend well enough and we didn't do enough up front but for the last five games we have done, so I will be putting this game to bed pretty quickly.
"Danny Rowe came in at right back and did himself proud and he did exactly what I wanted him to do,
"I wanted to see a bit more aggression and on the front foot from him and he did that tonight so that was a positive."
