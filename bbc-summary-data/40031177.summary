[SN]TITLE[SN]
SNP take control of East Dunbartonshire Council

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP will take control of East Dunbartonshire Council.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The party formed a minority administration after a council meeting following local elections earlier this month.
Before the poll, Labour and the Conservatives ran a minority administration between them.
While the SNP are now the biggest single party, they fall well short of an overall majority with just seven of the council's 22 seats.
The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have six councillors each, Labour has two and there is one independent.
Most of Scotland's 32 local authorities have now formed administrations, but a few are still to reach decisions.
Stirling Council voted on Wednesday evening to back an SNP-Labour coalition.
Christine Simpson (Labour) was named as the new provost and Graham Houston (SNP) as depute convener.
West Lothian and Edinburgh councils are due to hold meetings on Thursday, after both adjourned meetings last week.
In West Lothian, a proposed coalition between Labour and the Conservatives was blocked by Labour's Scottish Executive Committee. Labour has indicated that it hopes to find a way of governing as a minority.
There has been no sign yet of a deal to run Edinburgh Council. The SNP is the largest party with the Conservatives in second place. The SNP and Labour have each made it clear they will not do formal deals with the Conservatives in Edinburgh.
Inverclyde Council will also hold a meeting on Thursday.
Generally, councils now have either minority administrations led by the biggest local party or coalitions which include the biggest local party, but there are a number of significant exceptions.
In Aberdeen, the Labour group and the Conservatives have formed a coalition which keeps the SNP out - the Labour councillors have been suspended from the party for going ahead with the deal which was not supported by the party's Scottish Executive Committee.
