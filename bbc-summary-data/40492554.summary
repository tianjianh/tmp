The 24-year-old has now received new assurances from the club about his salary after he terminated his contract with them on Tuesday.
His agent and former Nigeria international Ayodele Stephen Makinwa says the issue was settled amicably.
"To be clear, we never asked for any financial improvement or whatsoever," Makinwa told BBC Sport.
"We settled the differences with additional guarantees with regards to payment."
"It's an avoidable and unnecessary problem but both parties have come out with a mutual understanding now."
Onzai has resumed pre-season training with the Turkish club.
On Tuesday, Makinwa explained the old deal they had with Trabzonspor.
"We have an agreement with the club which strictly states that the player has a right to terminate his contract if the club failed to pay him for two months or more," he said.
Onazi only joined Trabzonspor on a four-year deal from Italian side Lazio last August.
The Turkish club refused to comment on the situation when contacted by BBC Sport.
Algeria's Carl Medjani and Ghana striker Majeed Waris both recently quit the Turkish club following a dispute over unpaid wages.
