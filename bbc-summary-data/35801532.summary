Kruse narrowly overcame world number one Alex Massialas 15-14 in an earlier round before beating Alaaeldin Abouelkassem 15-5 in the final.
It was the 32-year-old's first gold medal since winning in Venice in 2009.
"I'm really pleased to win my second one," said Kruse. "This is really going to boost my ranking now."
Britain have already qualified for the team event for the Rio Games.
