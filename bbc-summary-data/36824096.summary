The 24-year-old has won seven caps and had a spell last year at French fourth-tier side US Le Pontet.
Robba will play for the Gulls in their pre-season match at Southern League side Tiverton Town on Tuesday.
"He was one that Robbie Herrera (Torquay's assistant manager) found," Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson told BBC Radio Devon.
"He's the Gibraltar number two international goalkeeper, so we'll have a look at him and see."
Torquay currently have just one goalkeeper on their books in American Brendan Moore, although former Plymouth Argyle youngster Cory Harvey has also been on trial at the club.
