The British actor appeared in the programme between 1978 and 1982.
Scotland Yard said officers forced their way into a Northcote Road flat in Walthamstow on Friday where the body of a man in his 50s was found.
Former colleagues in Grange Hill and numerous others took to Twitter to pay tribute to the actor.
Erkan Mustafa, who played Roland Browning in the TV series, tweeted: "Rip terry sue patt aka #bennygreen#grangehill legend you will be missed by true friends".
A tweet from actor Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo Maguire, said: "R.I.P Terry Sue-Patt the memories of our times together will never be forgotten! Love you FOREVER Xxxxxxxxxxxx."
The Met Police said it was called to the flat at 13:45 BST after concerns had been raised about the welfare of its occupant and officers "forced entry".
A spokesperson said the death was not believed to be suspicious and next of kin had been informed.
The TV series, created by Phil Redmond, ran for 30 years between 1978 and 2008.
Originally set in the fictional north London borough of Northam, it later moved to Liverpool.
The series was considered controversial by some parents who complained about storylines including teenage pregnancy and racism.
A story about drug-taking led to the Just Say No campaign and a top 10 single.
