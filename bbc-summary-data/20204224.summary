The surviving members of US R&B group TLC have confirmed plans for a new album, a decade after the death of bandmate Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.

Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas and Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins will also go on tour and are making a TV biopic of their lives.
Speaking at the Mobo Awards in Liverpool, T-Boz said the duo are due to start work on new material soon.
"We're going to still sound like TLC, evolving to whatever level we need to be at this time," she said.
The group were one of the biggest-selling and most influential acts of the 90s in the US, with hits including Waterfalls, Creep and No Scrubs.
After Lopes died in a car crash in Honduras in 2002, the remaining pair completed the group's fourth album 3D but have since only released occasional new songs.
Asked how they would fit into the modern pop scene, T-Boz said: "We've always grown throughout the years and have always had our own sound. That's what works for us and we don't have to worry about anybody else.
"When that stops working, maybe we'll hang up the towel, but that still works. We have to get into the studio and start feeling how we feel. You have to find yourself first and then you find the path and then you have an album before you know it."
There has been speculation that Lopes could be incorporated into the accompanying tour in the form of a hologram.
T-Boz and Chilli are also executive producers of the VH1 biopic and are about to cast actresses to play themselves.
