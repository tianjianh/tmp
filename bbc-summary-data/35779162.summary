Defending champions Australia have been dealt a blow after all-rounder Grace Harris was ruled out of the Women's World Twenty20.

The 22-year-old is being treated for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Team doctor Leanne Hutchison said: "It was not medically safe for her to fly and play whilst undergoing treatment."
Her replacement at the India-based tournament, which begins on Tuesday, will be uncapped all-rounder Nicola Carey, also 22.
While still awaiting her international debut, Carey was also called into Australia's trophy-winning squad of 2012 as an injury replacement for Sarah Coyte.
She helped Sydney Thunder win the inaugural Women's Big Bash League in January, and will join up with the Southern Stars' squad on Saturday ahead of their first game against South Africa next Friday, 18 March.
Australia are bidding for a fourth successive World T20 title after winning the event in 2010, 2012 and 2014.
