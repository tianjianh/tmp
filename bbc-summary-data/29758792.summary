Who are the 100 Women 2014?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
100 Women is back. Last year the BBC kick-started its pledge to represent women better in its international news output with the 100 Women season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But this was just the start - and today the series returns.
This year's list has more scientists and more women working in the arts. And with more than a fifth of participants under the age of 25, these are not only women to take notice of now, but ones to watch in the future, too.
Some of our women have made headlines, such Obiageli Ezekwesili, the former Nigerian minister leading the global campaign to rescue the 250 children captured by militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
Also new to the list this year is celebrated Austrian drag queen Conchita Wurst, who sparked a public outcry of love by spreading messages of tolerance after winning the Eurovision song contest in May.
Full coverage: 100 Women
We invited them to share their thoughts, experiences across three special days of output.
Please join our conversations about education, bringing up girls, women in science, entrepreneurship and women in war. We will be hearing from refugees who have built businesses in their new homes, as well as those leading soldiers on the frontline.
The conversation continues here on BBC News on radio, on television and online, bbc.co.uk/100women.
Join us on Facebook and Twitter, with the handle #100Women.
