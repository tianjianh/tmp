Ms Dugdale, who is one of four gay party leaders in Scotland, said Holyrood is "now considered the gayest parliament in the world"
In her column for the Daily Record newspaper, Ms Dugdale said "the rainbow flag" was "flying higher than ever".
Tory leader Ruth Davidson and UKIP Scotland's David Coburn are also gay, while Green Patrick Harvie is bisexual.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell also came out earlier in the year.
The Scottish Labour leader spoke out about her personal life for the first time in an interview for the Fabian Society, revealing that she has "a female partner".
She added: "I don't talk about it very much because I don't feel I need to. My private life is my private life, that's the thing I just have that nobody else gets to touch, and that gives me the strength to be calm elsewhere."
After winning support from opponents including Ms Davidson, Ms Dugdale said she was pleased with the "tremendous" backing she had received.
She wrote: "I've been bowled over by the tremendous support I've received this weekend after I decided to share with the world that I'm in love with a woman.
"The Scottish Parliament was once referred to as the rainbow parliament because of the kaleidoscope of party colours represented. Whilst the number of greens and socialists might have fallen back, the diversity of our parliament remains.
"In fact it's now considered the gayest parliament in the world.
"Whilst the rainbow flag might be flying higher than ever above Holyrood, we can take pride in the fact it's been there for LGBT Scots since day one."
