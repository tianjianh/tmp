De La Salle College: Education minister receives report into west Belfast school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Education Minister Peter Weir has received the independent report into De La Salle College in Belfast.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An investigation into events at the post-primary school was ordered by the former minister John O'Dowd in April.
There had been ongoing industrial problems at the west Belfast school for a number of months.
The minister has not, however, indicated when the report will be made public.
The investigation was carried out by a three-person panel consisting of leading educationalist Sir Robert Salisbury, trade unionist John Corey and Belfast Metropolitan College's principal Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se McGivern.
Their remit included looking at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils.
"I appreciate the wide interest in the report's findings and I am committed to sharing the recommendations as widely as possible," Mr Weir said.
"However, given the extent of the report, I will now take time to consider the findings and decide how best to take forward the recommendations.
"My main priority will be ensuring that all the necessary steps are taken so that the pupils of De La Salle College receive a high standard of education and the opportunity to develop to their full potential," the minister added.
