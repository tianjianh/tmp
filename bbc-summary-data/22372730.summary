The Conservatives have retained overall control of Wiltshire Council despite losing four seats in Thursday's vote.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Tories won 58 of the 98 seats, the Liberal Democrats 27, independents eight, Labour four and UKIP won its first seat in the county.
UKIP's David Martin Pollit won Melksham Central from the Lib Dems.
Conservative council leader Jane Scott held on to her Bybrook seat with a reduced majority and finds out on Saturday if she will remain as leader.
Mr Pollit said: "I'm stunned to be honest. We saw from the news this morning the successes overnight of the UKIP party, and long may it continue".
John Walsh, who won Fisherton and Bemerton Village for Labour by just one vote, said: "It was a close run thing, and all credit to my opponents who ran me very close indeed."
Nigel Carter and Jane Burton from the independent group the Devizes Guardians both lost their seats to the Conservatives.
Six Conservative seats were not contested - Warminster West, Tidworth, Ludgershall and Perham Down, The Collingbournes and Netheravon, Winterslow, Fovant and Chalke Valley.
