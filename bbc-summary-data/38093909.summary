Ellie Butler: Murdered girl's mother appeals child cruelty conviction

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The mother of murdered six-year-old Ellie Butler has launched an appeal against her conviction.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Jennie Gray, 36, is serving a 42-month prison term for child cruelty. She had also admitted perverting the course of justice.
Her partner Ben Butler was convicted of murdering Ellie in June and jailed for life, with a minimum term of 23 years.
The Court of Appeal confirmed Gray had made a "late application" to appeal both charges.
Appeals are usually limited to 28 days after conviction but Gray was found guilty in June.
Anyone lodging an application after deadline has to make representations as to why it should be accepted "out of time" by the court.
Ellie died in October 2013 from catastrophic head injuries while in the care of her father at their home in Sutton in south-west London.
She had been placed in the care of her grandparents in 2009 after Butler was accused of shaking her when she was a baby, although this was later quashed on appeal.
But the youngster went back to live with her parents in 2012 - 11 months before her death - after the couple won a High Court judgement.
Mrs Justice Hogg sided with Butler despite objections from police, social services and Ellie's maternal grandfather, Neal Gray.
In June, the Old Bailey heard that Butler battered his daughter to death during a "volcanic loss of temper".
The couple angrily protested their innocence when jurors returned guilty verdicts.
Gray told them they had made a "big mistake", while Butler shouted that he would "fight forever" in the appeal courts.
It is understood that Butler has not made any late application to the Court of Appeal.
