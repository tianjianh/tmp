Under the deals, Wood Group PSN (WGPSN) will deliver technical services and expertise to an unnamed international oil company.
They include detailed engineering, project management and commissioning support for a "significant onshore asset" in southern Iraq.
Wood said the two three-year contracts would lead to more than 100 jobs.
The contracts will be delivered from southern Iraq and Dubai, where WGPSN established an office in 2015.
The Iraq deals are the latest in a series of recent major contract wins by Wood Group.
Last week, WGPSN said 500 jobs had been secured after it won a contract extension for Shell's North Sea assets.
And late last month, it won a new $500m (£342.5m) contract to provide services for BP-operated offshore projects in Azerbaijan.
Commenting on the latest contract wins, David Buchan from WGPSN said: "These two significant contract wins demonstrate Wood Group's commitment to working closely with key clients to extend our operations in Iraq, where we see a growth market that complements our broad service capabilities, international knowledge and strong expertise."
In a separate development, Aberdeen-based subsea specialist Bibby Offshore announced that it had secured a multi-million pound contract in the southern North Sea.
Under the deal, it will provide construction services for assets owned by an unnamed "global energy player".
Bibby's construction support ship Olympic Ares and diving support vessel Bibby Polaris will perform subsea engineering work 150km (93 miles) off the coast of Lincolnshire.
The work is due to be carried out towards the end of this year.
Bibby Offshore chief executive Howard Woodcock said: "This is a significant win for Bibby Offshore - not only is it a strong representation of our technical engineering capabilities, but it further underlines our commitment to the North Sea market."
