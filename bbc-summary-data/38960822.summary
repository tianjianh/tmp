The RSPCA is investigating after a passer-by found the terrier crosses in Broadwater Forest, Tunbridge Wells.
One of the puppies was white with black markings, and the other tan-and-black. Both are thought to be aged somewhere between four and six weeks.
Charlotte Baumann, RSPCA, said: "These little puppies were so young and their short life was clearly a very sad one."
She added: "It is difficult to know how they died or why they were dumped here in this remote spot. They appear in a healthy weight and in reasonable condition, but there could have been a viral disease or similar.
"It may be someone that is trying to dispose of the dead puppies in the cheapest manner but there is huge concern for any surviving puppies.
"If they were from the same litter it is a concern that they died so quickly to one another at such a young age. If they were seriously ill any survivors might need emergency veterinary care."
"We urge anyone with any information about how these dead puppies came to be left in this way to call us, in particular anyone with information about how they may have died."
