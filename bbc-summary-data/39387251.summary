[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A police force has been cleared of wrongdoing after a suspect caused a fatal crash as officers pursued him.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guy Tomlinson, 37, caused the death of two men when he drove into a tipper truck during the chase in Leicester.
Passengers David Anger and Christopher Needham died in the crash on Fosse Road South, on 9 March 2016.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concluded the pursuit was correctly authorised and in accordance with force policies.
Tomlinson was jailed for nine years after pleading guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, two counts of causing death by driving while uninsured and two counts of causing death by driving while unlicensed.
Before the crash, an unmarked police car began to pursue Tomlinson's Peugeot after it was seen going through a red light on the B4114.
The IPCC report said CCTV footage showed the police car arriving at the crash six seconds after it happened.
There was also no indication Tomlinson was aware of the police vehicle travelling behind him at any point during the incident, the investigation concluded.
IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell, said: "Tragically two men lost their lives and our thoughts are with the families and friends of Mr Anger and Mr Needham.
"Hopefully, the completion of our investigation and conclusion of court proceedings will have answered some of their questions."
