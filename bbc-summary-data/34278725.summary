Public Health England's labs are moving to Essex from Wiltshire, Chancellor George Osborne has confirmed.

The Â£350m move will initially see 900 workers relocating from sites such as Porton Down in Wiltshire to the former GlaxoSmithKline labs in Harlow.
Public Health England says the move is a "big step forward for UK public health science".
But Salisbury MP John Glen has said he is "extremely disappointed" now the decision has been confirmed.
The new facilities, based on the site currently owned by GSK, will create a centre for research, health improvement and protection working on international health threats, such as Ebola.
The chancellor made the announcement while visiting Harlow this morning.
It was not only crucial for the future of research in public health, but it was also the right decision for the taxpayer, he said.
Duncan Selbie, Public Health England chief executive, said it was a "big step forward".
"Giving our world leading scientists world class facilities, located in the region with the greatest concentration of academic and commercial expertise in life sciences, will ensure we can deal with the health challenges we face now and are certain to in the future," he added.
But Salisbury MP John Glen, whose constituency covers the Porton Down site, said: "I am extremely disappointed to hear this decision has finally been confirmed.
"I have had four debates and lobbied hard for five years but the question now is how to maximise the opportunities for a brighter future for Porton.
"I met the chancellor yesterday and he has readily agreed to support a task force for Porton."
