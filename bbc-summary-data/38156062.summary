[SN]TITLE[SN]
Public hearing on plans for former Victoria Road school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A public hearing into fresh plans to demolish a former Aberdeen school and build more than 50 homes is being held.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Initial plans for the old Victoria Road School in Torry - which shut its doors in 2008 - were dropped in June.
Planning officials had recommended they be refused. More than 260 objections were lodged on the grounds of what was said would be the loss of granite heritage.
Developer Barratt Homes has now revised its plans.
The flats and three-bedroom homes would include granite into certain aspects of the properties.
