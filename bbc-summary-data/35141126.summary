[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cupar postal workers go on strike

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Postal workers have gone on strike in a Fife town on one of the busiest days of the year.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The dispute centres on Cupar postman David Mitchell, who was sacked after being accused of stealing mail.
Mr Mitchell has not yet been given his job back despite winning his unfair dismissal case at an industrial tribunal in September.
Members of the CWU union at Cupar sorting office started a 24-hour strike at 08:30 on Saturday.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said it had "robust contingency plans in place" and would continue to deliver to all of its customers in Cupar despite the strike going ahead.
The industrial tribunal had concluded that there was insufficient evidence that Mr Mitchell had stolen money and gift cards from his delivery round, and said he should be given his job back.
Royal Mail has challenged the ruling.
Stuart McIntosh of the CWU said staff at the sorting office were "angry and disappointed" at Royal Mail's treatment of Mr Mitchell, and had voted "almost unanimously" for industrial action.
He called on Royal Mail to abide by the tribunal's ruling, and said there were plans to take further industrial action if necessary.
