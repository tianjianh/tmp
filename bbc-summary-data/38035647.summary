[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Colchester recorded their biggest win of the season as they put four past Crewe Alexandra.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colchester took a 20th-minute lead through Kurtis Guthrie, whose flick-header from Owen Garvan's corner flew in at the near post.
Crewe goalkeeper Ben Garratt denied both Denny Johnstone and Richard Brindley, before Colchester had a penalty appeal rejected when Perry Ng appeared to handle Brindley's attempted cross in the area.
Brennan Dickenson's effort hit the roof of the net for Colchester early in the second half before Us keeper Sam Walker denied Alex Kiwomya at his near post.
Colchester doubled their lead with 18 minutes remaining through Garvan, who dispossessed George Cooper before coolly slotting past Garratt.
Substitute Drey Wright made it 3-0 four minutes later when he escaped down the Crewe left and squeezed a low shot into the far corner.
Dickenson wrapped up Colchester's victory in stoppage time with a superb left-foot strike that left Garratt no chance.
