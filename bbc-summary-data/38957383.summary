[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham Women have signed England international goalkeeper Rachel Laws for the WSL Spring Series competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Laws, 26, had been training with Arsenal but has decided to remain in the north east by swapping Sunderland for WSL 2 club Durham.
She will fill in for regular goalkeeper Helen Alderson, who is going to Africa for a three-month charity work stint.
"It's a club going in the right direction," Laws said. "I can't wait to start with a new club."
She continued: "Obviously it is a bit strange for over 10 years but it's a challenge I'm looking forward to getting started with."
The Newcastle-born keeper played 18 games for the Lady Black Cats last season, where she has played the majority of her career barring a loan spell at Liverpool in 2013.
