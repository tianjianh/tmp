Danny Brough's kick sealed a 23-22 win for the Giants and forces Rovers to now play-off for the last top-flight spot.
After the match, Peacock tweeted: "Beaten by a drop-goal that missed."
The Rovers forward responded to those who disagreed by adding: "Of course you had a better view than me. I was only directly in line with the ball, 12m away from the posts, on the pitch."
Interim Hull KR coach James Webster also doubted the validity of the drop-goal.
"I'm not sure the drop-goal went over," he said. "It looked to me like it went over the top of the sticks.
"It's a game of inches sometimes isn't it?"
The match was ex-England captain, former Man of Steel and multiple Super League Grand Final winner Peacock's third since coming out of retirement to try to help Rovers - where he works as head of rugby - maintain their Super League status.
Hull KR will play either Salford Red Devils or London Broncos in the Million Pound Game on Saturday, 1 October at the KC Lightstream Stadium.
