Police said he took Mrs Bird's wedding ring and other jewellery from her fingers after breaking into her house in Stone Road on 20 October.
O'Connor, originally from Birmingham, also stole other jewellery and cash and the incident left Mrs Bird shaken.
Other crimes include holding a knife to a 76-year-old Stafford man's face, holding him down and kneeing him in the back before taking his bank cards and a mobile phone and then burgling a house in Coppice Way, Stafford, on the same day and taking Â£67,000 worth of jewellery, electrical items and clothing.
Following the Newcastle-under-Lyme burglary, on 28 October, police found forensic evidence on a trowel used to smash a window.
Det Insp Phil Bryan, of Staffordshire Police, said O'Connor did not show any remorse for his actions.
