Eddie Jones: England players must 'change mindset' for success

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England must "change their mindset" to return to the heights of 2003's World Cup win, says head coach Eddie Jones.

The Australian's first Six Nations squad included seven uncapped players and some high-profile omissions.
"In this squad of 33 there are four or five players who, if they change their attitude, can become world-class players," said the 55-year-old.
"Why haven't England been dominant since 2003? Because they haven't had those players."
England's only Six Nations title since winning the Grand Slam in 2003 came in 2011. They were World Cup runners-up in 2007.

Jones, who was coach of Australia when England beat his side in the World Cup final in Sydney in 2003, said he wants a culture in which players are "absolutely fanatical about wanting to be in a winning England team".
"If we do the same as we have done since 2003 then we will get the same results," he added, after his squad announcement on Wednesday.
"To be the dominant team in the world you've got to be better than good and hard-working. It's going to take more than they have ever done in their lives."
Jones singled out Manu Tuilagi as a potentially pivotal player, saying he could perform a similar role to New Zealand centre Ma'a Nonu.
Tuilagi is expected to feature in the last two rounds of games after recently returning to action following 18 months out injured.
"Manu can play both inside and outside centre, but, when he's fit, he can be a Ma'a Nonu-type player," said Jones.
"He's got an exceptional skill-base and exceptional feet, he's got the ability to carry the ball through the line, he's got a short passing game, he can develop a kicking game, too.
"He can be one of the guys the team is built around."

Jones replaced Stuart Lancaster last year after England became the first host nation to exit a World Cup at the group stage.
He admitted his shake-up of the national team's methods would not be universally popular within the squad.
"You will find players that complain about it, but I will be happy because I'll know we are getting change," he said.
"We have to make the players a little bit uncomfortable."
England play their opening Six Nations fixture against Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday, 6 February.
