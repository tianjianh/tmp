Mabel Owen was pushed to the ground and had her purse stolen in the attack in Holyhead, Anglesey, on Thursday.
A crowd-funding page was set up to raise money for Mrs Owen's Christmas, and organiser Denise Owen said the pensioner was "overwhelmed".
She told BBC's Jason Mohammad programme donations had been made from as far away as the United States.
"This kind of thing doesn't usually happen, which is why it was very traumatic for Mabel and the community," Denise Owen said.
Det Ch Insp Iestyn Davies said the attacker was "lying in wait" for Mrs Owen as she walked home at around 12:30 GMT via Arthur Street East.
Mrs Owen, who has asthma, suffers from arthritis and uses a frame to help her walk, was pushed to the floor.
"While she is clearly shaken up by such a cowardly attack, she is a very resolute person," the officer added.
The attacker was around 5ft 8in (1.72m) tall, in his late 20s or early 30s and wore dark clothing.
