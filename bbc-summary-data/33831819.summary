[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Bantams went ahead on 43 minutes when Billy Clarke started and finished a move, linking up with Steve Davies who crossed for him to score.
But the Shrews levelled a minute after the restart with a messy goal.
Tyrone Barnett chased a long ball and his shot hit Rory McArdle before rebounding back off him and spinning into the net past keeper Ben Williams.
