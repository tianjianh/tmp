Leicestershire climbed to fourth in Division Two after wrapping up a six-wicket victory over Gloucestershire inside three days at Cheltenham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Clint McKay took three wickets in nine balls as Gloucestershire collapsed from their overnight 133-4 to 215 all out to leave Leicestershire 181 to win.
But after slipping to 16-2, Paul Horton hit 73 and captain Mark Cosgrove 56 to steer them to victory.
Gloucestershire remain third, eight points behind leaders Essex.
Leicestershire are only three points worse off after collecting their third win of the season, with both sides in the thick of the hunt for the one promotion place this summer.
