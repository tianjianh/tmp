Cole, 20, joined the Bantams last summer on a two-year deal after his release by Manchester City.
The England Under-20 international is the son of former Newcastle and Manchester United striker Andrew Cole.
Proctor, 23, has scored four goals this season and moves to Valley Parade on a one-month loan deal.
"Devante has got terrific speed and is an exciting player," Cod Army boss Steven Pressley told the club website.
"I hope he brings goals because we need a number nine we can rely on to score goals."
