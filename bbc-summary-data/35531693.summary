Widnes head coach Denis Betts says his current side is the best Vikings team he has ever coached in Super League.

Betts joined in 2010, coaching a season in the Championship before Widnes returned to Super League in 2012.
"We have a different quality of player. Our driving force over the next few years is to keep getting better," he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
"We want to be in the top half of the table and we don't want to sit in the bottom half."
After narrowly missing out on participating in the inaugural Super 8s last season, Betts says now his squad has improved they can aim higher this season.
"Every year the squad's got a little bit better and I can say with my hand on heart this is the best squad I've had in the five years I've been involved in Super League," he added.
"It's not top eight, it's top six, possibly top four, they are the things we are reaching for."
After winning their opening 2016 Super League fixture against Wakefield 24-16, Betts warned of the difficulty they face in their next fixture against reigning champions Leeds Rhinos.
"We're going to play the first or second best side in the world. We know that we've got to challenge that and we need to be more accurate and show more composure.
"They're not massive on shape and finding points in the field, they just keep stressing you with offloads and the ability they've got in individuals."
