Striker Leigh Griffiths held up a shirt with RIP Kieran and the number 13 on it after scoring against Aberdeen.
The goal came in the 13th minute of the game as supporters prepared to stage a minute's applause for Kieran McDade.
Celtic fan Kieran collapsed while on the pitch at Dunbeth Football Club in Coatbridge on 18 August.
The club had earlier confirmed on Facebook that the teenager died in hospital on Friday morning.
It is now raising funds to help Kieran's family through a JustGiving page.
His sister, Amy, said that Kieran had donated some of his organs, which had already saved the lives of two other people.
She wrote: "My family would like to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts for the overwhelming prayers and support you have given us.
"Our beautiful boy is now with the angels and will forever live on in our hearts.
"Would also like to let everyone know that Kieran has remained the most sensitive and generous boy that he is and donated some of his organs which has saved two peoples lives today. What a brave soldier, he will be truly missed."
