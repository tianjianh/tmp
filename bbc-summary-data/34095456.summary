Police Scotland said only one car had been involved in the incident, which happened on Seaton Road, to the north-east of the town.
It is thought the man's car left the road and ended up on its side in a nearby field.
Seaton Road will remain closed during the crash investigation and diversions are in place, a police spokeswoman said.
No further details about the crash victim are being released, but the family has been informed.
