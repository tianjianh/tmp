Michael Voller was assaulted after his team's FA Cup semi-final defeat by Chelsea at Wembley on Saturday 22 April.
He was set upon after the match outside an Indian restaurant near the stadium.
The 23 year old was punched in the face and suffered a broken skull and damage to his cheekbone and eye-socket.
Michael's father, Chris, told the BBC the only reason he could think of for the attack was that "one of his friends had a navy blue jacket on".
Doctors feared he could be left with permanent damage to his eyesight following the attack.
The e-fit shows a white male in his early 20s.
Police said the suspect was approximately 5ft 10ins tall and was wearing a black hooded top or jacket at the time of the attack.
Det Con James Robb, of The Met, said: "This unprovoked and cowardly attack has resulted in injuries that could affect the rest of a young man's life.
"There is no place for this kind of violence in football or anywhere else.
"Someone knows who committed this unprovoked attack and I sincerely hope they do the right thing and help us place this violent individual before the courts."
