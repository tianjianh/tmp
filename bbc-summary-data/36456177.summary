Farah established a new British record of seven minutes 32.62 seconds, with Butchart, 24, running 7:45:00.
Butchart ran the fastest Scottish 5,000m last month in what was a second Olympic qualifying standard.
He also managed a personal best over 10,000m in May, with the Olympic trials to come in Birmingham on 24-26 June.
Eilidh Doyle continued her fine start to the season with a second place in the 400m hurdles, finishing with the same time [54.57 secs] as USA's Cassandra Tate but missing out on the photo finish.
Doyle, 29, had won the Diamond League opener in Doha and then taken third in Rome, and she led to the line here before Tate's late surge and dip.

"It's a brilliant class of athletes out there, so to be that close, I can't complain," Doyle told BBC Sport.
Lynsey Sharp ran under two minutes for the 800m but that was only good enough for fourth place, with Francine Niyonsaba of Burundi clocking an impressive 1:56.92 to win.
