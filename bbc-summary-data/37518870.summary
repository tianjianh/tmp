The David Crompton letters: What they tell us

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
South Yorkshire Police's suspended chief constable is taking his boss to court after being told to step down in the aftermath of the damning Hillsborough inquest conclusions. Documents now released to the public have laid bare how their relationship broke down.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
As families were digesting the news they had spent 27 years fighting for, the chief constable of the police force which had caused the crush on the terraces alluded to "other contributory factors" to blame for the deaths of 96 football fans.
It was an act of "unacceptable insensitivity" to victims of the disaster from David Crompton, according to South Yorkshire's Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Alan Billings - and convinced him to ask for his chief's resignation.
Letters between the two detail the events that unfolded in the immediate aftermath of the inquests in April 2016.
They paint a picture of a power struggle that played out at the heart of the country's most embattled police force.
A force that while led by Mr Crompton faced continuing accusations it covered up the events of Britain's worst football disaster and ignored widespread sexual abuse of children in Rotherham.
Meetings between Mr Crompton and Dr Billings started early on the day it was found that all 96 Liverpool fans had been unlawfully killed. during the football disaster in 1989.
Dr Billings went alone to Mr Crompton's office at 07:30.
"The chief constable heard me mainly in silence. He did not seem to appreciate the enormity of the situation," writes Dr Billings.
Mr Crompton denies this in a returning letter, saying that Dr Billings started the meeting by declaring he came as the "bearer of bad news".
He claims the Labour PCC had been told by senior Labour MPs that "the party was threatening a wide-ranging media campaign against David Crompton that would not be restricted to comments made in Parliament".
As the meeting concluded, Mr Crompton was "adamant that he would not resign, since he did not believe he had anything to resign for".
A few hours later, after the conclusions were read out, Mr Crompton made his first statement.
"As I have said before, I want to apologise unreservedly to the families and all those affected," he said.
The documents reveal that Dr Billings expected the force to be barraged with condemnation, noting that the media were now "camped outside".
Criticism was building over the claim that barristers acting on behalf of the chief constable had pursued lines of questioning during the inquest that sought to once again try to blame Liverpool fans for the disaster.
The documents in fact show at one stage during the inquest the coroner rejected a formal complaint from the Hillsborough families about the force's line of questioning.
In the midst of a growing chorus of complaints, Dr Billings writes that in the late afternoon he became aware that Mr Crompton intended to issue a further media statement that would attempt to clarify why certain questions had been asked.
The attention of the world's media was turning to a debate about what would happen in Parliament the next day.
This would be the moment the government passed its judgement on the force's conduct in relation to the football disaster. It would also provide, as planned, the platform by which Andy Burnham and other politicians would launch a withering attack on both South Yorkshire Police and its Chief Constable.
Mr Crompton writes that the intention of his second statement was to "mitigate the risk of a misleading narrative gaining traction".
Dr Billings felt though that any attempt to justify the force's action would simply make it look like the force was more concerned about its own image.
At 12:20, ten minutes before the House of Commons was set to debate the findings of the inquest, Mr Crompton issued what would become the second and now fateful statement.
"We have never sought, at any stage, to defend the failures of South Yorkshire Police or its officers. Nevertheless, these failures had to be put into the context of other contributory factors," he said.
This is the most contentious line in the statement, and the central reason why Dr Billings is asking Mr Crompton to resign.
Dr Billings says that the phrase "other contributory factors" gave the impression that South Yorkshire Police was still trying to put blame on the Liverpool fans.
Mr Crompton and his lawyers disagree, saying that the phrases refer to other events and the actions of other organisations during the 1989 disaster.
Dr Billings describes the second statement as catastrophic, writing that he believed at this point the government was "fast losing faith in the force's ability to stem the tidal wave of criticism it was being subjected to".
A Hillsborough family member called the PCC's office that afternoon to talk about "the pain caused to him personally by the behaviour of the chief constable's barrister".
"I could not see how the chief constable could remain without trust and confidence draining away," writes Dr Billings.
In response to this, Mr Crompton says that Dr Billings - despite having seen the statement he was to publish - "did nothing to prevent publication or to revise it".
Breaking point came at 14:00 when the PCC went to Mr Crompton's office to ask him to either retire or to resign.
If he did neither, Dr Billings said he would suspend the chief constable. How he was eventually suspended is disputed.
At 14:50, Dr Billings claims the final standoff between the pair unfolded as Mr Crompton, along with his deputy Dawn Copley, arrived in his office.
"They would not sit down and talk. The chief constable simply said he was not prepared to resign," writes Dr Billings.
As Billings enforced the suspension at 15:00 it brought to an end a frenetic and highly-charged 48 hours at the top of South Yorkshire Police.
But in effect it has given rise to new legal confrontation that could now ultimately be settled in the High Court.
