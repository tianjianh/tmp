Gillingham dented Preston North End's League One automatic promotion hopes with a dramatic injury-time equaliser at Deepdale.

Jermaine Beckford gave Preston the lead after linking up with Joe Garner before Callum Robinson doubled the advantage.
Gillingham pulled one back after the break when Jermaine McGlashan slotted the ball home from outside the box.
The visitors struck an unlikely late equaliser when Leon Legge nodded in Josh Pritchard's cross.
The result means that Preston's five-point advantage over third-placed MK Dons was cut to just three points after they won against Fleetwood.
