[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Donna Sullock let friend Michael Pearce look after son Alfie while she went on a night out last August and said the baby had no marks on him when she left.
Newport Crown Court heard the defendant text her saying Alfie was "fine" but soon after he was brain damaged.
Mr Pearce, 32, of Nelson, Caerphilly county, denies murder and manslaughter.
The injuries were said to have happened in the two hours the defendant babysit Alfie, of Fairwater, Cardiff, for the first time on 16 August.
The jury were read a series of texts between the defendant and 29-year-old Ms Sullock, who became friends when she was six months pregnant.
He texted a photo of the baby to her and she replied: "Has he been crying, his face looks red?"
Responding a minute later, at 20:20 BST he said: "He's had a little wind. He's fine now, sleeping, don't worry".
He sent another text 20 minutes later saying: "You can trust me you know," and then at 21:07 BST, another text was sent informing Ms Sullock that Alfie was still sleeping.
But four minutes later, the court heard he dialled 999 and then called Alfie's mum to say her baby had stopped breathing and was being taken to hospital by ambulance.
Alfie was taken to Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff where he died four days later.
The prosecution claim Mr Pearce had beaten him with a shoe and a hard plastic bottle.
A post mortem examination showed Alfie died of blunt trauma injury and extensive bleeding into the brain.
The trial continues.
