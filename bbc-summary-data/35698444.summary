[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Coventry's first academy school has been taken out of special measures by Ofsted inspectors.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Grace Academy was rated "inadequate" in 2014 but the latest inspection found overall improvement and that it "no longer requires special measures".
Praising the school's new leadership team, Ofsted gave the academy a "requires improvement" rating following January's inspection.
Academy principal Colin Boxall said "this is a good first step".

The education watchdog said the academy required improvement in the five key inspection areas: leadership, teaching, achievement, behaviour and study programmes for 16 to 19 year olds.
Inspectors said: "Many staff in the academy care deeply for the well-being of the pupils and the spiritual, moral and social development of pupils is given a high profile."
They also said senior leaders had been effective in moving the academy out of special measure, leading to improvements in teaching and behaviour and higher achievement.
Mr Boxwell said: "We will continue to seek the highest standards for our students to ensure this continues."
