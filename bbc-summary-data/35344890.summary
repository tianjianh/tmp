The former cycling champion aims to ride in the Foxhunter Chase for amateur jockeys on Gold Cup day on 18 March.
Racehorse owner Andy Stewart has made Aintree Foxhunter runner-up Pacha Du Polder available for her to ride for the rest of the season.
Pendleton, 35, completed her first point-to-point race over jumps when finishing fourth in a race on Sunday.
Pacha Du Polder, a nine-year-old gelding, is trained by Chloe Roddick in Somerset.
"It's great that an owner of Andy's stature is putting his faith in me to ride one of his horses," Pendleton said.
She is looking to go from complete novice to riding at jump racing's showpiece fixture in the space of a year.
