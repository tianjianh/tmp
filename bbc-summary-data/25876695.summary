[SN]TITLE[SN]
Oxford's Westgate Shopping Centre plans scaled back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a new Oxford shopping centre have been scaled back following a public consultation.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Revisions to the Westgate Shopping Centre scheme, in the city centre's West End, include a reduction in the heights of all five proposed blocks by up to 1.3m (4ft 3in).
The maximum height was originally expected to be up to 90m (390ft).
Other changes include a new pedestrian footway.
The amended plans for the existing centre and adjacent land have now been submitted to Oxford City Council by Westgate Alliance, and are open to public comment.
The plans, which include about 70 shops and up to 122 new homes, were originally submitted in September last year.
A decision on the planning application is expected in March.
