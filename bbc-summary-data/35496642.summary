Mission to save stranded horses on island on Lough Beg

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Volunteers have mounted a mercy mission to save horses stranded by winter flood waters.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They brought hay and feed to the animals stuck on an island on Lough Beg near Toome. Three animals were dead. A further 10 were still alive.
It is believed they had come to the island on a causeway when the lough level was low.
They became stranded when winter flood waters running off Lough Neagh raised the level.
Members of the community rescue service based at Portglenone took supplies to the island on Thursday.
Norman Worthington said they had received a call to alert them to the presence of the horses.
The animals seemed to be in decent condition and some attempt had been made to feed them with hay.
But the ground had been badly cut up and the horses were standing in up to 10 inches of mud.
The dead animals have been covered with heavy plastic.
The welfare of horses is now a matter for councils under law.
Mid Ulster Council said it had received a complaint and was investigating.
