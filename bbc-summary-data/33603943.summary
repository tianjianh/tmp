A young man from Northern Ireland has died while on holiday in Ibiza.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He is Alan Drennan, 21, a mechanic, from Newtownabbey, County Antrim.
Mr Drennan had left Northern Ireland on Saturday with a group of  friends for a holiday on the island. He was found dead in his hotel room on Sunday.
Spanish police said there were no signs of violence and the death seemed to be of natural causes. But they are waiting for an autopsy to be carried out.
It is not clear at this stage when that will take place.
Mr Drennan's father, also Alan, told Cool FM: "This is breaking our hearts, it really is. We cannot understand why.
"Alan was called after me and he was just mini me. He was Alan junior. He was me all over and, boy, will I miss him."
A spokesperson for the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: "We can confirm the death of a British national in Ibiza on 19 July.
"We have been liaising with the Spanish authorities and are providing support to the family at this difficult time."
