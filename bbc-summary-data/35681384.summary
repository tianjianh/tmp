[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The film adaptation of the erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey has swept the board at the annual Golden Raspberry or Razzie awards in Los Angeles.

Fifty Shades won worst screenplay, and worst actor and actress for Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson.
The duo also won worst screen combo, but Fifty Shades tied for worst film with Fantastic Four.
Eddie Redmayne was named worst supporting actor, a year on from winning the best actor Oscar.

He won the ignominious prize for Jupiter Ascending, a widely lambasted sci-fi flick from the Wachowski siblings.
The British star is up for another best actor Oscar on Sunday night for his role in The Danish Girl.
The reboot of the Fantastic Four franchise scored wins for worst director for Josh Trank and worst remake/rip-off or sequel.
The Razzies' tongue-in-cheek award ceremony is held in Los Angeles every year the day before the Academy Awards.
Organisers lampoon the nominees, voted for by the public, in a series of comedy sketches and show tunes.
There was also a Donald Trump impersonator, who highlighted the fact that the presidential hopeful was himself a Razzie winner in 1990 for playing himself in Ghosts Can't Do It.
There is always the anticipation that one of the stars will turn up to collect the award, but none has been brave enough since Sandra Bullock picked up her award in person in 2010.
The founder of the Razzies, John Wilson, was full of admiration for how bad this year's crop of nominees were.
Speaking about Jupiter Ascending, he told BBC News: "It's an insane movie and the centre of the insanity is Eddie Redmayne becomes emperor of the universe, and apparently he got there by over-acting.
"Of the five films that were nominated, Jupiter Ascending was the most entertainingly awful film."
Serial nominees Adam Sandler and Kevin James managed to dodge triumphing in any of their categories as Pixels and Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 left empty-handed.
