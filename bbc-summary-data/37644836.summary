O'Sullivan toiled after going 2-0 ahead in the third round in Manchester.
Wakelin won the next three but missed a pink to allow his rival, ranked 61 places higher, to level at 3-3 before holding his nerve in the decider.
The defeat came after O'Sullivan claimed he was not worried about losing, suggesting tournaments were 'coming along like buses'.
Other surprises included world number 111 Jak Jones beating Ding Junhui 4-2, while the 2010 world champion Neil Robertson let slip a 3-0 lead as he lost to Xiao Guodong.
