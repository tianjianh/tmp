The two males and two females were undernourished and underweight when saved from north Wales beaches, but are now fighting fit at 40kg (6.2 stone) each.
They bade zookeepers a fond farewell at Penrhyn Bay beach, near Rhos-on-Sea.
The zoo's director Nick Jackson said: "It's great to be able to see the seals return to their natural habitat, each in great shape and back where they belong."
