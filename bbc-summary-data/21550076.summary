A Grade II listed Nottinghamshire wedding venue is facing an uncertain future as its lease is put up for sale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bridgford Hall, in West Bridgford, has been offered as a 125 year lease by its owners Rushcliffe Borough Council.
It currently houses the register office but the council said it was open to all offers.
Deadline for businesses to express an interest in running the venue ended on Friday and a public consultation on its future ends on Sunday.
About 400 people have given their views to the council about the future of the hall with the majority of respondents wanting to keep it as a wedding venue.
Councillor John Cranswick, deputy leader of the council, said the feeling among residents was that it should remain a wedding venue.
He added: "But clearly my interest is in getting the best value for the residents out of the building."
