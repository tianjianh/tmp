[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A 54-year-old former boarding school care worker, on trial accused of historical child sex abuse, has been found dead at his East Sussex home.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Darren Turk, of Etchingham, was accused of 14 offences including rape and indecent assault, from 1996 to 2002.
The offences were allegedly carried out against boys aged 11 to 15 at Frewen College, Northiam, where he then worked.
The charges did not involve any staff or pupils currently at the school.
Sussex Police said the trial at Lewes Crown Court had been stopped after Mr Turk, 54, of Fontridge Lane, was found dead at his home on Thursday.
A police spokesman said: "There are no suspicious circumstances and the coroner's officer has been informed."
Mr Turk was a member of care staff and later head of care at the boarding school but not a teacher.
Frewen College describes itself as a day and boarding school for children aged between seven and 19 with specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia.
