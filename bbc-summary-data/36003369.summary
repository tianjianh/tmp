The Tykes had the better of the first-half chances, as Sam Winnall and Ivan Toney both fired over the bar.
Burton improved after the break, with Adam Davies twice having to make saves from winger Mark Duffy.
Calum Butcher also fired narrowly wide for the Brewers, before Winnall scooped the ball over from inside the six-yard box late on.
Burton remain second in the table, three points ahead of third-placed Walsall, while Barnsley are only two points adrift of the play-offs in seventh.
Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough told BBC Radio Derby:

"I thought first half they shaded it with a couple of opportunities - half chances, nothing serious.
"I thought second half it was ours. If we can just get a break in the penalty area, then we'll get a goal, but it's certainly not through the lack of effort.
"We have shots, it hits peoples' legs, it rebounds, it's bobbling around the six yard box, it's not dropping to a yellow shirt."
