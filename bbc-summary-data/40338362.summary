[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
High levels of violence mainly related to drug use have been found by inspectors at HMP Lincoln.

They also said it was overcrowded and struggled to hold prisoners in safe and decent conditions, after an unannounced inspection in February this year.
A report said violence levels had more than doubled since those found during the last inspection in November 2013.
But HM Inspectorate of Prisons praised the category B jail's cleanliness and efforts to "get the basics right".

The report stated "too many prisoners felt unsafe", and recorded 126 assaults and fights six months before the inspection, with some injuries requiring hospital treatment. Attacks on staff were also "relatively high", with 49 incidents logged.
It said the number of inmates at risk of suicide or self-harm was also high, with 256 incidents of self-harm in the same period, three times higher than at the last inspection. But the report suggested "a smaller number of prisoners with complex needs accounted for many of the incidents".
Inspectors said the Victorian prison "faced increased levels of violence, often related to the prevalence of drugs and the difficulty of managing the problem with reduced staff numbers".
Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said it had "achieved some success" and the new governor and his team had "redoubled efforts to build on the institution's strengths."
Chief Executive of HM Prison & Probation Service Michael Spurr said HMP Lincoln's governor was working to "achieve further improvements" at the jail.
