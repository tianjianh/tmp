It started as a mission to collect whiskey for a party towards the end of World War Two and ended in a blazing inferno in which 11 US personnel died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On 14 April 1945, just a month before the end of World War Two, 10 US servicemen and one woman died after their Flying Fortress bomber crashed in the Isle of Man.
Lt Robert Vielle, an experienced and decorated pilot, had been flying a B-17G from England to Northern Ireland when he hit bad weather over the Irish Sea.
The aircraft veered off-course by several miles before coming down and bursting into flames in a field above Port St May.
The exact cause of the crash has never been ascertained.
Those on board had been sent on a peaceful mission to Northern Ireland to collect supplies of whiskey for a party at the US Army Air Force station at Thurleigh in Essex.
Ivor Ramsden, a keen historian and aviation expert, said the flight was an example of the "sheer madness of war".
