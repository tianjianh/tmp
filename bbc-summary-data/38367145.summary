Ibrahim Ismail was found outside the Raxo shisha lounge on Moseley Street, Digbeth, Birmingham, in the early hours of Saturday. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.
A post-mortem examination revealed he had stab wounds to his chest and back.
Police said they were investigating reports there had been an "altercation" beforehand.
Ozge Emin, who has set up a funding page on social media to help pay for a funeral, said Ms Ismail had no family in the UK having left Syria "to find a better standard of living."
He said he was not sure about the family's whereabouts in Syria.
He described Mr Ismail as a "hardworking, humble, caring and kind-hearted brother."
