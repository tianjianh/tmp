The theatre was evacuated after the 18-year-old fell into the stalls at about 21:30 BST on Thursday, Lancashire police said.
He was treated by paramedics at the scene and was conscious when he was taken to Royal Preston Hospital.
His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.
As the 18-year-old landed, he caught the shoulder of a woman on the end of one of the rows in the stalls, police said. She was not injured.
Eyewitness Robert Simmill said it was "probably the worst thing" he had ever seen.  He tweeted: "Terrible scenes at Blackpool Grand theatre tonight!"
He told the BBC: "I just saw the body fall... then there was a loud thud. Everyone around got up and started screaming and shouting. Meanwhile, the show carried on with the song as they didn't know anything had happened.
"People from the audience were shouting at the actors to stop. I looked up to the third tier as I was in the stalls, and saw people crying. Everyone was shocked and scared, it seemed.
"We were all told to evacuate through the exits. There were stories about him fainting and falling but others were saying he jumped. I saw people shaking around me; even I was shaking from the shock."
Joanne Brookes tweeted: "Shocking scenes. I was there with my 12 yr old. Something I can't believe she had to witness."
The Grand Theatre released a statement on Twitter, saying: "We can confirm an incident @Grand_Theatre this evening. Police/Ambulance service attended, performance was abandoned."
It also said that a decision would be made on Friday on future Grease performances at the theatre.
Blackpool and Fylde Light Opera Company confirmed it would resume the musical production later and that Saturday's matinee and evening performances would also go ahead.
