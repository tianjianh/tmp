Belisario Agulla: Newcastle Falcons back-line player signs permanent deal.

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Argentina back-line player Belisario Agulla has signed a permanent deal with Newcastle Falcons.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Agulla, 27, joined the Falcons from French side Agen in October and has since made eight Premiership appearances for the club.
"This squad is very united and I have been made to feel very welcome since I got here" he told the club's website.
"I share the ambitions of everyone here in wanting to get better for next season."
Agulla is one of six players who have recently renewed deals with the club, which finished 11th in the Premiership this season.
The club's top try-scorer Nili Latu, prop Rob Vickers, lock Will Witty, scrum-half Sonatane Takulua and fly-half Craig Willis have already committed their futures to the Falcons.
Ten new signings have also been announced by the club in recent weeks as they look to improve on a disappointing season.
