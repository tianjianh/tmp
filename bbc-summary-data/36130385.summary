A deal is set to be finalised between the current board and entertainment firm Gaming International to sell the National League club.
Nicholson took over in September and has kept the team in the division, despite being 12 points from safety in the middle of February.
"I would like to be the manager here next year," Nicholson told BBC Devon.
"I would like to be given the chance to move forward.
"But new owners may have new ideas, and if they have then I'll carry on being a Torquay fan and hope my chance comes again."
Nicholson paid tribute to chairman David Phillips and his team, who took over the club in June 2015 after millionaire former owner Thea Bristow sold her stake.
"They're coming into a club that's on the up, they're coming into a club with a solid foundation now," said Nicholson.
"The chairman and the board that have taken over and given this club life-support for the past year have done a fantastic job.
"We've been fortunate enough to make sure that the club is in the league it needs to be in for now, because this is a league football club, but they're coming into a club now that they can do with as they wish."
