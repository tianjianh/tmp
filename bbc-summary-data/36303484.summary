Portsmouth manager Paul Cook insists he is the right man to take the club forward after their League Two play-off semi-final defeat by Plymouth Argyle.

Peter Hartley's stoppage-time winner at Home Park ended Pompey's hopes of promotion to League One.
Cook, who joined Portsmouth from Chesterfield last summer, is adamant he will be in charge next term.
"My job now is to manage the club again and lead the club by example," Cook told BBC Radio Solent.
"I will lift myself and I certainly will not be leading by example by walking around sulking.
"I don't think managing Portsmouth in any league is easy. I personally hope I am here for a long, long time. I am very lucky to manage this club."
Pompey, who were top of the table in October, eventually finished sixth in League Two after failing to win in their final three games.
But Cook, 49, believes the south coast side must come back stronger and learn from their play-off disappointment.
"We are very much a work in progress," he added.
"The only positive I take out of it is the club and state the club is in - the whole infrastructure from the training ground to the support I get everyday. It's so disappointing to fall short."
