Warwickshire County Council said police and bomb disposal experts made the weapon safe at its Judkins site in Nuneaton on Sunday afternoon.
The area was closed off to the public but reopened the following day.
In 2010, staff in Leamington spent two days sifting through rubbish to find butcher Darren Higham's wedding ring.
The family heirloom had slipped off Mr Higham's finger as he dumped wood at the Prince's Drive site.
A pair of inflatable dolls, a suitcase full of "marital aids", cannabis plants and a boat measuring 50ft (15.2m) have recently been brought to recycling centres across the county, according to the authority.
Councillor Alan Cockburn said: "We always welcome items of household waste to our recycling centres and the many weird and wonderful items we receive from the public never ceases to amaze us.
"As usual, it is down to the diligence of our staff who do their utmost to make sure that the items ultimately go to the most appropriate destination."
