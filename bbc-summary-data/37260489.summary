A Football Association panel found Aguero, 28, guilty of violent conduct after he elbowed West Ham's Winston Reid in City's 3-1 Premier League win on Sunday.
Argentina international Aguero is also suspended for City's home league game with Bournemouth on 17 September and the EFL Cup third-round match at Swansea on 21 September.
Aguero has scored three goals in three league games this season for City, who are top of the table with a 100% record.
He also scored a hat-trick in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier against Steaua Bucharest.
