Peterborough Cathedral's organ to be re-pitched after £410k raised

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A cathedral's organ is to be re-pitched after a fundraising campaign raised £410,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Peterborough Cathedral's organ is slightly sharper than the "standard pitch" introduced in 1939.
Campaign manager James Dyer said he was "really excited" that the year-long fundraiser had been successful.
He said work on adjusting the length of the 5,286 pipes would start in July and take up to two years to complete.
"It's going to be a big undertaking," he said. "The idea is much of the instrument will be taken away in one go, as much as possible.
"It's going to take a while."
The organ dates back to 1894, before a standard pitch was established in 1939.
It is half a semi-tone sharper than a standard pitch.
The organ re-pitch is a small part of the four projects undertaken by the cathedral in the run-up to its 900th anniversary in 2018.
