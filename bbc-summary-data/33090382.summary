It was discovered by dog walkers near to Hyrstlands Park, off Track Road, Batley at around 09:40 BST on Monday.
West Yorkshire Police said the contents had been confirmed as that of a fully grown human placenta.
The force said its main concern was to ensure the woman and child were well and had received medical help and support.
Det Sgt Adrian Belle said: "We are keen to speak to anyone who can explain how the placenta came to be in this location.
"We do know the placenta was from a baby which had progressed to full term and are of course anxious to trace both the mother and the child to check on their welfare."
