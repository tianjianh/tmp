Arbroath-born Masterchef: The Professionals winner Jamie Scott helped lead the delegation from the East of Scotland European Consortium, aiming to increase exports of Scottish produce.
Arbroath smokies, Dundee cake, Falkirk fudge and Aberfeldy oatmeal were among the products promoted.
Scotland is marking its Year of Food and Drink throughout 2015.
The East of Scotland European Consortium (ESEC) was established in 1992 to represent the continental interests of eight local authorities from the east of Scotland, including Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dundee City, Falkirk, Fife, Perth and Kinross and Stirling.
Potato vodka produced at an Arbroath farm-turned distillery was on the menu, along with Heather Rose gin produced at the Strathearn Distillery in Perthshire, St Andrews cheese from Fife and jam from Dundee.
Mr Scott said he was "delighted" to support the work of the ESEC.
He said: "Scotland is rich with different foods, all a joy to cook with. Working with Angus produce first-hand makes me very aware of the importance of supporting these local businesses, like Arbikie Vodka and Arbroath smokies to name a few."
Angus councillor Mairi Evans, who led the delegation, said it was a "fantastic opportunity" to showcase top Scottish produce.
She said: "The region covered by ESEC offers great diversity and variety, with an enviable offering of the traditional and contemporary.
"From the fantastic offering of venison, lamb and the world-renowned Aberdeen-Angus beef, to the soft fruit industry of the east and of course the incredible seafood thanks to our lengthy coastline, our culinary heritage is unrivalled."
