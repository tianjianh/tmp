A rare bronze sculpture of children's favourite Peter Pan is expected to fetch up to £30,000 at auction.

The figure is a smaller version of the statue which appeared one night in London's Kensington Gardens in 1912.
Scottish author J M Barrie himself commissioned the statue by sculptor Sir George Frampton.
Valued at between £20,000 to £30,000, the bronze replica - which was cast in 1920 - will be sold at Lyon and Turnbull in Edinburgh on Wednesday.
The anonymous seller said: "We are sorry to part with this beautiful statue - it has been in my family for nearly 100 years.
"We hope that it will be as loved by its new owners as much as it was by us."
Barrie, who was born in Kirriemuir, Angus, first used Peter Pan as a character in The Little White Bird (1902) and returned to him in a later stage play before expanding the story to produce the 1911 novel Peter and Wendy.
The original statue appeared in public with an announcement in The Times newspaper which read: "There is a surprise in store for the children who go to Kensington Gardens to feed the ducks in the Serpentine this morning...
"A May-day gift by Mr J M Barrie, a figure of Peter Pan blowing his pipe on the stump of a tree, with fairies and mice and squirrels all around.
"It is the work of Sir George Frampton and the bronze figure of the boy who would never grow up is delightfully conceived."
John Mackie, head of decorative arts at Lyon and Turnbull, said: "This famous statue is held in great affection all over the world - it is the iconic image of the boy who never grew up and a very beautiful work of art."
A house in Dumfries which helped inspire the Peter Pan story is to be converted into a national centre for children's literature.
Barrie moved to Dumfries in 1873 at the age of 13 and credited the "enchanted land" at Moat Brae, where he played, as being the basis for the story.
At one point the house was facing demolition but finance has come from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Creative Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway Council.
The conversion is due to be completed in 2018.
