[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nobody is to be charged over the death of a 21-year-old man found with serious head injuries in Derbyshire a year ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body of Halcyon Theuri, 21, from Oakerthorpe, was found in the early hours of 31 August 2015, on Wingfield Road, Alfreton.
An inquest into how he died will be held at a later date. Derbyshire Police said there was "insufficient" evidence to charge anyone.
Two arrests were made, but police now say the investigation is "complete".
The two were arrested in September 2015 on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Both were later released on bail.
Despite several appeals to the public , Derbyshire police said: "The investigation into the death of Halcyon is complete. There was insufficient evidence to bring charges."
A spokeswoman added if further evidence did come to light, "it would be looked at and [the case] potentially reopened."
Speaking after his death, Mr Theuri's mother Faith and stepfather Andi, said: "Halcyon was a caring and loving grandson, nephew, brother, friend to many and son to us.
"The void that has entered our lives is not anything we would wish on any parents."
