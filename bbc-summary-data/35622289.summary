The two English players shared the first four frames before O'Sullivan hit a 124 clearance to edge ahead in the semi-final in Cardiff.
O'Sullivan, a three-time champion, then made breaks of 94 and 88 to lead 5-2 before winning with a 78.
Australia's Robertson beat Northern Ireland's Mark Allen 6-4 to reach his second final, to be played on Sunday.
Robertson, the 2007 champion, had trailed 2-0 in the best-of-11 frame match, but won the crucial third frame after a foul by Allen, of Northern Ireland.
The world number three then won five consecutive frames to lead 5-2 and withstood a comeback by Allen to reach the final.
Speaking after the semi-final, O'Sullivan, 40, compared Robertson to cinematic cyborg law enforcer RoboCop.
"I have watched him through the UK Championships and he never showed emotion through the whole tournament, " O'Sullivan told BBC Sport, ahead of the best-of-17 final.
"It shows what an unbelievable professional he is. He is Robocop, he is like the new Steve Davis or Stephen Hendry."
Robertson, 34, believes O'Sullivan is the favourite for the title.
"I don't mind flying under the radar," he added. "It is nice, I can be the underdog."
