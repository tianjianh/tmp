European football: Housewarming horrors and the new Neuer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Madrid's top two clubs kept up their winning form on the pitch despite being hit with transfer bans off it during an eventful week on the European football scene.

Atletico remain top of La Liga after winning at Las Palmas, while Real were 4-0 up after 18 minutes as they thumped Sporting Gijon 5-1.
Paris St-Germain continue to see off all-comers in France, while Juventus chalked up a 10th straight Serie A win to maintain the pressure on leaders Napoli.
But what else might you have missed across Europe? BBC Sport has rounded up the best of the action.
Housewarming parties can be a real pain. You want to show off your home to a few friends, and then some gatecrashers turn up and ruin it for everyone.
Well, that's pretty much what happened to Udinese in Serie A on Sunday. Their Stadio Friuli home has been rebuilt over the last three years, with new stands constructed on three sides, and the remodelled stadium was opened fully for the first time this weekend as champions Juventus visited.
Unfortunately, Juve proved to be the equivalent of the house party guests who drink all the wine and then trash the kitchen. The champions were 4-0 up by half-time, as Paulo Dybala scored twice and Sami Khedira and Alex Sandro once each.
To make matters worse for Udinese, Brazilian centre-back Danilo was sent off for conceding the penalty that allowed Dybala to score the fourth goal.
Mind you, Udinese were hardly well-behaved visitors themselves, winning 1-0 at Juventus on the opening weekend of the Serie A season. Massimiliano Allegri, having become the first Juve manager to lose the season's opening two Serie A matches, has now clocked up 10 successive league wins.
He's 6ft 5in, wears size 14 boots and is already being touted as the long-term successor to Manuel Neuer at Bayern Munich. Yet he is still only 15 years old.
Christian Fruchtl is a name we are likely to be hearing a lot more. The teenage goalkeeper was invited to join manager Pep Guardiola's senior squad during a recent training camp in Qatar, and he seems to have made a big impression on the Germany number one.
Neuer, 29, said: "What are his main attributes? His size! I think I was one-and-a-half heads shorter than he is when I was 15.
"He's got great co-ordination despite his height and big feet and the talent is definitely there with him."
Bayern were beaten 2-1 in a friendly against second-tier Karlsruher SC on Saturday as defender Jerome Boateng earned a red card in conceding a late penalty that was converted past Neuer.
The Bundesliga leaders, who are eight points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund, launch the second half of their campaign at Hamburg on Friday.
Colin Kazim-Richards' struggle to reproduce his impressive form of last season continue, after was dropped from the Feyenoord squad for Sunday's game against PSV Eindhoven for threatening a journalist.
The Turkey international took exception to an article in the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad which questioned his attitude, and the 29-year-old confronted the reporter responsible when he arrived at the pre-match press conference.
The situation was quickly defused, but as a result the forward was left out of the squad by coach Giovanni van Bronckhorst, and told to report to training on Monday to explain himself.
Leytonstone-born Kazim-Richards started his professional career at Bury in 2004, and had spells at Brighton, Sheffield United and Blackburn.
After stints in Turkey and Greece, he joined Feyenoord initially on loan at the start of last season, but has struggled to make an impact and has scored once in 11 league appearances.
It was a case of the one that got away for Ligue 1's bottom club Troyes on Saturday. Chasing their first league win of the season, the French side led Rennes 2-0 after 15 minutes, only to end up losing 4-2.
But in the process of completing a comeback that lifted him into contention for a Champions League spot, Rennes managed to overcome a penalty jinx that had lasted 17 months.
Philippe Montanier's side had missed their last six spot-kicks in Ligue 1, a run stretching back to August 2014, when Ola Toivonen - now on loan at Sunderland - scored against Caen.
They had enjoyed a little more success in cup competitions - even winning a Coupe de France tie against Nice on penalties earlier this month. But there was still a degree of apprehension among Rennes supporters when, with their team two goals down and needing a lift, they were awarded a spot-kick for a foul on Ousmane Dembele.
Step forward Senegalese defender Fallou Daigne to score. Minutes later, Rennes got a second penalty - and Daigne converted that one too.
These are strange times in France's top flight, with Paris St-Germain streaking away at the top, Troyes miles adrift at the bottom, and everybody else scrunched up in the middle.
No one is going to stop PSG winning the title. Laurent Blanc's side have dropped just six points in 21 matches, losing none, and kept up their incredible form with a 1-0 victory at Toulouse on Saturday.
But their dominance has created a curious mathematical situation - in which second-placed Monaco are closer to the relegation zone than they are to the top. Leonardo Jardim's side, despite winning 2-0 at Lorient on Sunday, are 21 points behind PSG, but only 15 ahead of third-from-bottom Guingamp.
So, are Monaco in the championship race, or are they in a relegation fight? Well, whatever happens, it is unlikely to be as crazy as Algeria's Ligue 1 was last season, when all 16 teams were still in contention to win the title with four games left - and the division's top scorers ended up being relegated.
