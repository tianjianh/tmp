The Edinburgh flats made famous as the home of one of the main characters in Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting, could receive "listed" status.

Cables Wynd House, known as the banana flats due to its distinctive curved shape, is a post-war building in Leith.
The flats were built in the 1960s, and residents are being asked for their views on the plan.
Historic Environment Scotland is planning to stage a consultation event next month.
The plan also includes neighbouring Linksview House, which is also mostly owned by the City of Edinburgh Council.
Cables Wynd House was made famous for its part in the Irvine Welsh book where it featured as the childhood home of the character, Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson.
Along with the 10-storey building Linksview House, the "banana flats" mark an important period in the city and Scotland's social housing landscape.
A proposal to consider the property for listing by Historic Environment Scotland has reached an initial view that the building may meet the criteria as a category A listed property, meaning that it would be recognised as being of national importance.
Dawn McDowell, Historic Environment Scotland's Deputy Head of Listing, said: "Scotland is renowned for its rich architectural heritage.
"While our palaces, abbeys and castles are a key part of this, they are only a fraction of our diverse historic environment which ranges from industrial buildings to the homes we live in.
"Cables Wynd House and Linksview House were innovative, ground-breaking designs at the time when they were built and offered a new vision for social housing and for those who lived in them.
"A key aim of listing is to recognise the special architectural importance of these buildings as well as celebrating and sharing their wider social and cultural role."
Residents of Cables Wynd House and Linksview House will receive a letter from Historic Environment Scotland about the consultation.
Residents and owners can also go to an informal drop-in meeting on 6 December at Leith Library, on Ferry Road from 16:00 to 19:00.
Listing is the way that a building or structure of special architectural or historic interest is recognised by law through the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997.
