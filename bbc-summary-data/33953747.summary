It happened at about 10:25 BST on Sunday, West Midlands Ambulance Service said.
The Cessna 152 ended up upside down at the side of the runway.
Paramedics and the air ambulance attended but the pilot, a man in his 30s, managed to climb out of the plane unaided and escaped serious injury, the ambulance service said.
"He was checked over by the Midlands Air Ambulance doctor and had no injuries on him, just a few aches and pains. He was discharged at the scene," a spokesman said.
