[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A £3m lottery prize has gone unclaimed after the winner, who bought their ticket in Stirling, failed to come forward in time.

The winner, who would have shared in a quadruple-rollover prize pot from the 17 December draw, had 180 days to claim the money, but did not.
The £3,062,272 prize, plus the interest it has accumulated, will now go towards National Lottery funded projects.
A spokesman said it was a "real shame" that someone had missed out.
He said: "Unfortunately, I can confirm that the ticket-holder did not come forward within the deadline to claim their prize and has now sadly missed out on this substantial amount of money.
"We tried very hard to find the ticket-holder and it's a real shame that they have missed out, but there is still one winner - the nation.
"This money, and all the interest earned over the 180 days, will now go to benefit projects all over the UK funded by the National Lottery."
