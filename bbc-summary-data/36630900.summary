The international development secretary tweeted: "Today's a good day to say I'm in a happy same sex relationship, I campaigned for Stronger In but sometimes you're better off out!"
Thousands of people took part in the Pride event in central London.
Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: "Congratulations Justine - that's great news."
Chancellor George Osborne was also among those to respond to the news, tweeting: "Congrats Justine. Best news in last 48 hours!"
Mr Osborne has been out of the spotlight since Britain voted to leave the European Union on Thursday. He had campaigned for the UK to remain in the EU.
Ms Greening was elected to Parliament in 2005 and was the youngest female Conservative MP at the time.
She held the transport brief before becoming development secretary in 2012.
Her announcement came as the director of Pride London, Michael Salter-Church, said this year's campaign slogan was No Filter.
He said: "No Filter is a call to arms. A call for people to be themselves, to live as their true selves."
