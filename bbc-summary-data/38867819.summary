The German, punched by Ukrainian Andriy Grivko on stage three, outsprinted Team Sky's Italian Elia Viviani, while Britain's Mark Cavendish was fourth.
Cavendish gesticulated with frustration after failing to come round Kittel, who he had been following in the sprint.
"I'm super proud. It's a nice start to the season," said Quick-Step Floors rider Kittel, who won three stages.
"The final sprint didn't go according to plan because the chain of my lead-out man fell off so I had to go on my own."
Kittel's defence was expected to come under most pressure on Friday's hilly stage four, but it was cancelled because of high winds.
He ended up 18 seconds clear of Dutch rider Dylan Groenewegen in the overall standings with German John Degenkolb in third.
Team Dimension Data's Cavendish, who won the race in 2015, finished eighth overall, two places behind One Pro Cycling's Thomas Stewart, who was the highest-ranked Briton on general classification.
