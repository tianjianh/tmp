[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A patient suffering breathing problems spent 16 hours on a trolley at a hospital that hours later was put on "black alert", her daughter claims.

The woman was admitted to the Royal Cornwall Hospital last Monday, and was also told no pillows were available for her, her daughter said.
The black alert, the highest level the NHS issues, was declared on Tuesday and is still in place.
The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust has not yet commented.
The woman, who is aged in her mid-60s and did not want to be named, was discharged from the hospital on Friday.
Her daughter said she remained on a trolley from about 20:00 GMT on Monday until 12:00 on Tuesday, during which time she was moved between the A&E department and the Medical Admissions Unit.
She also had to sit in a chair for about 30 minutes while a bed was found, her daughter claimed.
The "black alert" at the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, which covers St Michael's in Hayle, West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance and The Royal Cornwall at Treliske, applies to the whole health and social care system in Cornwall.
So far during the alert 280 beds have been blocked by people who were fit to leave but had no care package in place.
On Monday, trust bosses decided the alert should remain because of severe pressure on the service.
