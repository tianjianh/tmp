The 20-year-old Northern Irishman took the wicket of Marcus Trescothick and made an unbeaten 34 on his Championship debut against Somerset last September.
County Antrim-born Adair has since made his way into the Bears' T20 Blast team this summer, having played four games.
He steps up to his senior contract from the Academy development deal he signed earlier this year, in February.
"Since making his first-class debut, Mark has worked very hard at his game and been very impressive in training," said Bears director of cricket Dougie Brown.
"We are delighted with his performances this season and believe that he has a big future here at Edgbaston."
Warwickshire have also given first contracts to Academy graduates Matt Lamb, George Panayi and Liam Banks.
Batsman Lamb, 19, who plays club cricket in the Birmingham League for Barnt Green, went to Bromsgrove School.
Fast-bowling all-rounder Panayi, 18, who went to Shrewsbury School, currently plays Birmingham League cricket for reigning champions Shrewsbury.
Batsman/off spinner Banks, 17, who joined the Academy from Staffordshire in 2012, plays in the North Staffs & Cheshire League for Hem Heath.
"It's fantastic to see young players step up to a senior level," added Brown. "Matt, George and Liam now have an opportunity to train with the squad.
"We're committed to giving our young players the best possible opportunity to progress to the professional ranks.
