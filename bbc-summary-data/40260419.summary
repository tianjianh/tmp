Japanese electronics giant Toshiba says it is facing a fresh lawsuit from another group of foreign investors seeking damages following its $1.2bn accounting scandal.

The company says it has now been served with 26 complaints in total, demanding nearly $1bn in compensation.
Last month, Toshiba warned it could collapse because of soaring losses.
Originally known for its consumer electronics products, Toshiba has faced a series of difficulties.
An accounting scandal, uncovered in 2015, led to the resignation of several members of the firm's senior management, including the chief executive, after the company was found to have inflated the previous seven years' profits by $1.2bn.
Toshiba said it received the most recent complaint, demanding $399m in compensation, on Monday. It had been filed on 3 April with the District Court in Tokyo by 70 shareholders, foreign institutional investors and individuals.
The company said it had received prior warning from some of the shareholders that the action would be brought.
As a result, part of the impact of this latest claim for damages was reflected in the financial outlook Toshiba published last month, when it warned it was likely to report an annual loss of 950bn yen ($8.4bn; Â£6.5bn).
Toshiba's problems are not confirmed to the accounting scandal. Its problems came to a head again in January this year, when it became clear its US nuclear unit, Westinghouse, was in financial trouble.
Westinghouse subsequently filed for US bankruptcy protection. It had been hit by bit losses having suffered huge cost overruns at two projects in Georgia and South Carolina.
