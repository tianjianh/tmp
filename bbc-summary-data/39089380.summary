The money from the Constitutional Research Council was spent on pro-Brexit advertising throughout the UK.
The group of pro-union business people is led by a Conservative party member.
About £425,000 of the funding was spent mainly on advertising in Britain. The rest went to DUP party funds.
Speaking at an anti-Brexit rally in west Belfast on Saturday, Mr Adams said the DUP needed to provide more answers.
"The DUP acted as a funnel for £425,000 coming from a Scottish Tory, which had an impact on the outcome.
"They need to explain how they got themselves into that position."
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. stressed it was "not a Northern Ireland referendum, but a UK-wide referendum".
The details of the donation came as the spending returns of the Stronger In and Vote Leave campaigns in last year's EU referendum are under investigation, the Electoral Commission has announced.
