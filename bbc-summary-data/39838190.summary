[SN]TITLE[SN]
Premier Division: Galway United 0-0 Derry City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Derry City had to settle for a point against Galway United as Monday's Premier Division game at Eamonn Deacy Park ended without a goal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The big talking point of the first half involved Derry keeper Ger Doherty who handled out his area when Galway's Padriag Cunningham broke through.
Galway protested that Doherty should have been sent off but Robert Hennessy produced a yellow card.
The point was enough to lift Galway off the bottom of the table.
Derry, who have won just once in their last eight league matches, remain fourth in the table.
