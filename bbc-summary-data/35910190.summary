At 18%, the country has one of the worst rates in the European Union for children dropping out of school.
"Football and mathematics are not mutually exclusive," said Romanian Football Federation president Razvan Burleanu.
"Through this project, children will learn the basics of football and have an opportunity for the first time in our country - to discover mathematics through an attractive approach."
Romania's friendly with Spain in Cluj did not cause any problems for the mathematicians as it ended goalless.
