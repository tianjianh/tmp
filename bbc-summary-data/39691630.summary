It was largely snubbed in the nominations for the TV Baftas, but The Night Manager has picked up two Bafta craft awards.

The BBC espionage thriller won for editing and sound in the awards that celebrate behind the scenes talent.
The Crown, National Treasure and Planet Earth II also won two awards each at the ceremony.
In the Bafta TV nominations only Tom Hollander from The Night Manager was nominated for best supporting actor.
This was a surprise after the show did so well at the Golden Globe awards where Tom Hiddleston, Olivia Colman and Hugh Laurie all won acting prizes and the drama also won an Emmy for director Susanne Bier.
Netflix series The Crown - which leads the Bafta TV nominations - picked up two craft awards.
The drama about the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II won for costume design and special, visual and  graphic effects.
Sir David Attenborough's Planet Earth II won two of its nine nominations.
Those were the factual photography award for its cities episode (which was up against three other episodes from the series) and the factual sound category.
National Treasure, which starred Robbie Coltrane as a comedian accused of historic sex crimes, won for direction and original music.
Happy Valley writer Sally Wainwright picked up a Bafta craft award for writing. It was her third Bafta in this category and her fifth Bafta overall.
The writer of Mum, Stefan Golaszewski, won for best comedy writing, beating Phoebe Waller-Bridge for Fleabag, Julia Davis for Camping and Steve Coogan, Neil and Rob Gibbons for Alan Partridge's Scissored Isle.
War and Peace, which was up for five awards, won one for production design.
Other winners of one award were Black Mirror for make up and hair design, Hillsborough for factual editing, Rillington Place for photography and lighting and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway for best multi-camera direction.
The Bafta special award for outstanding contribution to the industry went to prop master Bobby Warans.
He has made props for nearly 100 of the most popular British television programmes of the past 40 years, including The Morecambe and Wise Show, The Two Ronnies, Strictly, Absolutely Fabulous and Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway.
