Exeter Crown Court heard Connor Cain, 19, was left for dead after the attack in the city in April 2016 but survived.
While treating his wounds in hospital, doctors found more than Â£3,000 worth of drugs concealed in his rectum.
One of the attackers boasted on Facebook afterwards, writing: "Ha, ha, ha. I stabbed the kid and the blade snapped so I could not pull it out."
The seven men, who are from Liverpool and Devon, received sentences ranging from one year in jail, suspended for two years, to 15 years' imprisonment.
Cain was jailed for three-and-a-half years last July for possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.
The court heard he was blinded by pepper spray before being attacked by at least four men who were wearing masks or hoods.
Cain suffered severe injuries including a four-inch deep chest wound.
After the attack, Matthew Henney boasted about what he had done on Facebook by sending messages to two girls he knew in Liverpool saying: "There was only the handle left.
"He was only a little London muppet. He should not have tried to start. I warned him."
The court heard the assault was due to a rivalry between a group of drug dealers from Liverpool who had been operating around Devon and Cornwall.
Judge Mr Justice Sweeney told the offenders: "The events in the flat must have been entirely terrifying. He suffered terrible injuries which would have been fatal if he had not received immediate treatment. It was good fortune that he did not die."
"There was pre-planning and a significant degree of premeditation. You were all involved in Class A drugs gang which decided to see off opposition on what you considered to be your turf."
