Rotherham United 2-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Wolves boss Walter Zenga saw his side fight back from 2-0 down to start the Championship season with a draw at Rotherham United.

Danny Ward headed the hosts in front from a corner before Will Vaulks made it 2-0 with a stunning 25-yard strike.
George Saville rounded home goalkeeper Lee Camp to pull one back before Wolves defender Dominic Iorfa was sent off for pulling back Jon Taylor.
But Iceland striker Jon Dadi Bodvarsson fired in to earn Wolves a point.
Bodvarsson, making his debut after signing from German side Kaiserslautern, was set up by fellow debutant Joao Teixeira to put a dampener on Alan Stubbs' first game in charge of the Millers.
Stubbs, who left Hibernian to join Rotherham in the summer, handed starts to four of his summer signings - including record-signing Taylor - although it was Vaulks who made an immediate impact with a sweetly-struck half-volley that gave his side a deserved two-goal lead.
Although Saville pulled one back, Rotherham looked increasingly in charge when Iorfa was ruled to be the last man as Taylor tried to run in on goal.
But Wolves improved following the introduction of on-loan Benfica midfielder Teixeira and ultimately deserved their point in former Italy goalkeeper Zenga's first game since replacing Kenny Jackett.
Rotherham manager Alan Stubbs: "There were a lot of positives to take, but right now it feels like it is two points dropped rather than a point gained.
"The two goals were sloppy and ones we should have prevented.
"It was mixed, I was pleased with certain elements and a part of me was frustrated as we didn't get a reward for the position we put ourselves in."
Wolves head coach Walter Zenga: "It's very nice, sometimes you win, sometimes you learn, today I learned! The stadium was full, it was a nice game. It's amazing. If we'd have lost it might have been different.

"Even in the second half when we had 10, we refused to lose. That is the most important thing. I think we deserved to draw.
"There were many emotional moments, especially the welcome the fans gave me."
