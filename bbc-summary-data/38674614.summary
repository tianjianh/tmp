[SN]TITLE[SN]
Slipstream caused girl's wheelchair to strike passing train at Twyford

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A train's slipstream, combined with a gust of wind, caused a teenage girl's wheelchair to roll into a passing train, a report has concluded.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The wheelchair was stationary on a platform and parallel to the tracks before it came into "multiple glancing contacts" with a passing freight train at Twyford station on 7 April, 2016.
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said the wheelchair brakes were released by an "aerodynamic force".
The girl suffered a minor foot injury.
RAIB said the girl's mother was unaware the freight train, which was travelling at around 45mph, posed a hazard to the wheelchair, and therefore did not take any additional precautions beyond applying the brakes.
As a result of the investigation, the RAIB recommends the Rail Delivery Group, an organisation which looks how to improve services on the railway, should inform the public of the potential hazards from train slipstreams.
