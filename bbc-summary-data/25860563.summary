Justin Bieber - Growing up disgracefully?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
After a troubled year which has seen him frequently clash with police, the media and fans, Justin Bieber is in danger of falling into territory occupied by wayward stars such as Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears.

Young, gorgeous and talented - with the world seemingly at their feet, awash with wealth and flattery - these overnight teen sensations have frequently stumbled as they make the transition to adulthood.
On Thursday, Bieber was arrested in Miami accused of road racing and driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs. It is the most serious incident to emerge following a year of behaving badly.
Bieber, who will turn 20 this March, was discovered just six years ago by manager Scooter Braun.
Within months, he was being mentored by R&B star Usher and had a contract with Island Records, thanks to its boss LA Reid.
His debut single One Time was followed by My World, a seven-track mini album released in November 2009, which went platinum in the US and, eventually, double platinum in the UK and his native Canada.
By the end of the year, Bieber was performing on the legendary US TV show Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest.
The following month he was a presenter at the Grammy Awards - the same month he released his first fully-fledged album, My World 2.0 - featuring Ludacris, which rapidly became an international hit.
When it topped the US Billboard chart, Bieber became the youngest solo star to debut in the number one slot since Stevie Wonder in 1963.
It went on to top the charts in Australia, Ireland, Canada and New Zealand.
Early in 2011, the 3D film Justin Bieber: Never Say Never was released just ahead of Valentine's Day, cashing in on the teenage star's legions of adoring female fans - dubbed "Beliebers". It topped the US box office, taking an estimated $12.4m (Â£7.5m) on its opening day.
Later that year, his second studio album, Under the Mistletoe, also debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200.
By this time he was working on his third - and arguably most mature - album Believe, which debuted in June 2012.  It sold 374,000 copies in its first week on sale in the US.
He was also named the third-most powerful celebrity in the world by Forbes magazine.
But the desire to be taken seriously as an artist, also marked a turning point in Bieber's behaviour, triggering a string of incidents that have tarnished his previously squeaky clean image.
In May 2012, the singer was accused of attacking a photographer while shopping with his then girlfriend Selena Gomez in Los Angeles.
Jose Hernandez-Duran claimed the star had jumped out of a van to kick him in the abdomen and punch him in the face. However he did not face charges after prosecutors cited "insufficient evidence".
Two months later Bieber was involved in a high-speed chase with another photographer.
Months after he was ignored in the 2012 Grammy shortlist, Bieber became the youngest artist to have five chart-topping albums in the US in February 2013.
Believe Acoustic topped the Billboard 200, making him one of only nine artists in Billboard history to have a number one album across four consecutive years.
Approximately a month later, while on tour in the UK, he angered fans by turning up onstage almost two hours late. It followed a previous late arrival at a concert in Nottingham just three days before.
Amid fury from parents and tears from young fans, Bieber tweeted an apology "for anyone we upset", explaining the "40-minute" delay was due to "technical issues".
"I'm not okay with things being exaggerated," he wrote on Twitter. "My relationship with the media is not always easy but I'm trying. I'm all about the music and the performance and I respect my fans."
At a third London concert, Bieber was treated by doctors after suffering breathing problems. One day on, he was filmed clashing with a photographer in London's Park Lane, tweeting: "I let the paps get the best of me."
The singer had a whirlwind fortnight in the UK, being photographed in several nightclubs in between his concerts in Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, Nottingham and London.
He went on to upset fans in Portugal, where he cancelled one of his gigs; and in Amsterdam, where he suggested in a guestbook at the Anne Frank Museum that the Holocaust victim might have been "a Belieber". And in Dubai, where he turned up two hours late again - and was rushed by a fan onstage.
His pet monkey Mally was quarantined in Germany after Bieber failed to produce the required vaccination and import papers. Mally was later re-homed at a safari park.
Then came the drug raids on tour buses in Detroit and Sweden - but on both occasions the star was not present.
Urinating in a bucket in a nightclub in New York was a minor infraction by Bieber's 2013 standards.
There followed charges over illegal graffiti in Brazil, and a call for him to clean up more graffiti from a hotel wall in Australia. He was also accused of disrespecting the Argentine flag after he used a microphone to mop the floor with it during a concert in Buenos Aires.
"I saw a bra and thought it was a shirt," he said, apologising at the time.
This year has already seen the young star in trouble for allegedly egging his neighbour's house in Los Angeles, causing extensive damage and almost injuring a 13-year-old girl.
A subsequent police search of his home led to a member of his entourage being arrested for alleged cocaine possession.
"I get that the eggs don't seem that significant, but it does rise to the level of a felony," Lt David Thompson told reporters.
As a result of his latest infringement, arrested in Miami and accused of road racing and driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs, Bieber has been transferred to a Miami-Dade County jail pending an initial court appearance.
