[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 22-year-old's contract with Scottish Premiership side Hearts expired at the end of the 2016-17 season.
Full-back Paterson made over 150 first team appearances for the Tynecastle club.
"I'm absolutely delighted and buzzing to be part of this big club," Paterson said of his move to Cardiff.
"It's nice and early so I've got a lot of time to bed in, get to know my way around the area and introduce myself.
"It's great timing and I'm happy to be here."
London-born Paterson has won five caps for Scotland after making his debut against Italy in May 2016.
