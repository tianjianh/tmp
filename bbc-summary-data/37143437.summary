The former Newport Gwent Dragon played an hour and received a standing ovation from the crowd in Colwyn Bay.
Bath scored four tries through Jeff Williams, Matt Banahan, Henry Thomas and Kane Palma Newport.
Rhys Patchell kicked a penalty, two conversions and scored a try for Scarlets with David Bulbring also crossing for a touchdown.
The game was Faletau's first since joining the west country club from Dragons at the end of last season.
The game also saw Wales internationals Ken Owens, Gareth Davies, Scott Williams and Liam Williams get their first run-outs after the summer break.
It was Scarlets' last friendly before they open their Pro12 campaign at home to Munster on 3 September and followed a 45-3 defeat by Exeter.
Coach Wayne Pivac said: "Today's performance was a big improvement, but there are still some areas that we need to work on.
"I thought we were very competitive in the first half. It was great to have players like Scott and Liam back and I thought they added a lot."
