Sale Sharks battled back from 14 points down to hold Worcester Warriors to a high-scoring draw at Sixways.

Worcester only took the lead for the first time just before the break, after Sale had led 17-5 inside 18 minutes.
Wynand Olivier's try and a second from Jamie Shillcock then gave Warriors a 31-17 lead after 52 minutes.
But Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty converted a Halani Aulika try to level it late on after Neil Briggs gave the Sharks hope with a try 15 minutes from time.
A Will Addison brace and MacGinty penalty helped initially put Sale in control, with Shillcock getting Worcester's only early points.
The hosts, however, finished the first half strongly, with tries from Jonny Arr and Perry Humphreys edging them ahead.
Sale's cause looked increasingly tough when Byron McGuigan was sin-binned for a late tackle on Warriors fly-half Ryan Lamb as he offloaded a pass for Olivier to cross for Warriors' bonus-point try.
Lamb then passed 1,000 Premiership career points with the conversion.
Shillcock went on to add another try, only for Sale to come back strongly and deny Worcester their first triumph of the season and extend their winless run to eight matches, although they have drawn twice this season and are four points clear of bottom-placed Bristol.
Sale remain with just one win from four games this season and continue to search for their first victory on the road.
Worcester head coach Carl Hogg: "It's very disappointing as five tries and 34 points should be enough to win you a Premiership game.
"We made a slow start but we got ourselves back into it and by half-time we looked a very dangerous side and were dominating.
"We had two or three opportunities to put the game to bed, which we didn't take and in the end ill discipline in giving them the ball back in the final quarter cost us the win."
Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond: "To be fair, we started really well before conceding silly penalties to let them back into it.
"Worcester are a better side than they were last year so I'm happy to come away with three points as we are missing six or seven players through injury and we are hoping that the magnificent seven will be back within the next few weeks.
"At 31-17 I thought we were too far away for a comeback but we got our driving maul going in the last quarter."
