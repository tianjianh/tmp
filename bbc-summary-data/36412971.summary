Long-serving Inverness Caledonian Thistle striker and captain Richie Foran has been appointed their new manager on a four-year contract.

The 35-year-old succeeds John Hughes, who left earlier this month citing frustration at budget restraints.
Chairman Kenny Cameron said: "Richie has been a great asset, both on and off the park, since joining us in 2009.
"He particularly understands the blend of spirit, values and togetherness that makes the club what it is."
Irishman Foran, who began his career with St Patrick's Athletic and played for the Republic at under-21 level, joined Caley Thistle after leaving Southend United.
He has gone on to play for the club 209 times, scoring 45 goals, the last being in the final game of the season in a 4-0 win over Dundee.
"The influence and passion he exhibited as a player, combined with his clear determination and knowledge, will all serve him well when it comes to building on and enhancing the club's qualities," Cameron told the club website.
"It was only a matter of time before Richie stepped up into a management role and that time has come."
Foran's appointment will not come as a surprise in the Highland capital despite his lack of managerial experience.
"We believe the length of contract demonstrates commitment on both sides," said Cameron.
"The board received and reviewed a high number of applications for the vacant position and Richie quickly became our preferred candidate.
"This was cemented further during several meetings to discuss the role, his approach and view for the future.
"Our decision that he is the right man to lead the club was unanimous and we look forward to working closely with him on the next stage of what has been a remarkable journey."
Foran, who also played with Shelbourne, Home Farm, Carlisle United, Oxford United, Motherwell and Darlington, inherits a side who slipped to seventh place from third the previous season with Hughes complaining about the club's ability to attract fresh talent and compensate for injuries.
However, the new manager, who only made 10 appearances this season because of injury problems, has already earmarked new additions to his squad.
"My intention will be to preserve continuity at the club while bringing a new freshness and playing style," he said.
"Joining Caley Thistle seven years ago has proved a marvellous decision.
"Thanks to coming to the Highlands I now have a lovely wife, two lovely children and have had the most enjoyable part of my playing career.
"But I will now give up playing to fully focus on making a success of my new job.  I want to play exciting, attacking football which entertains the supporters.
"I've identified areas in our play that I think I can improve and I've identified what kind of players we need to bring in to improve our team."
