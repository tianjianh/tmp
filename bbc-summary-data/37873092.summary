The event will take place at BBC Hoddinott Hall in Cardiff with the programme available to watch live on the BBC Wales Sport website, BBC Red button and on BBC iPlayer (UK only) and BBC Radio Wales from 19:30 GMT on Monday, 5 December.

The pinnacle of the awards ceremony will be to crown the 2016 BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year from the following nominees (listed in alphabetical order):
Hollie Arnold capped her rise to sporting prominence by winning F46 javelin gold at the 2016 Rio Paralympics.
The Cardiff-based competitor first set a new world record, then broke it with her final throw of 43.01m to take the title.
Arnold was triumphant in all her competitions in 2016.
Gareth Bale helped Wales reach the European Championships semi-finals with three goals at the group stage.
The Real Madrid forward has now scored 26 goals for Wales throughout his career, two short of Ian Rush's Wales record.
During 2016 Bale also won a second Champions League winners medal for Real Madrid and he was also nominated for Best Fifa Men's Player 2016.
Elinor Barker rode alongside Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell-Shand and Katie Archibald to win team pursuit gold at the Rio Olympics in her first Games.
The 22-year-old and her team-mates set a world record of four minutes, 10.236 seconds in their final against the United States.
Barker has since enjoyed medal success as a solo competitor at international events.
Aled Sion Davies broke the Paralympic record to win F42 shot put gold in Rio, having won bronze in the same event at London 2012.
The 25-year-old threw 15.97 metres, 16 centimetres short of his world record and was clear of his nearest rival by more than a metre.
Davies had earlier broken the discus and shot put world records during the year and took gold in these events in the European Championships.
Cyclist Owain Doull won the first Welsh gold for Team GB of the Rio 2016 Olympics as he joined Sir Bradley Wiggins, Steven Burke and Ed Clancy to defend their men's team pursuit title.
The 23-year-old and his team-mates beat world champions Australia to ensure GB's success.
Doull enjoyed his best season to date, having earlier won a silver medal in the team pursuit at the World Championships.
At 23 years of age, Jade Jones is already a double Olympic gold medallist.
She defended the -57kg title won at London 2012 by again dominating her competition at the 2016 Rio Games, becoming the first Welsh woman to defend an Olympic title.
Jones also won the European title earlier in the year to ensure a memorable 2016.
Hannah Mills and 470 class partner Saskia Clark took Olympic sailing gold at Rio, finishing one place better than four years previously at the London Games.
Mills and Clark held a 20-point lead going into the medal race in Rio after winning three times and never finishing below eighth in the 10 races.
That meant they only had to finish the final race to take gold.
The 12th world champion from Wales defended his IBF featherweight title with a unanimous points win over Eric Hunter at London's O2 Arena in April.
Selby was downed for the first time in his career during the bout, but rose from the canvas to dominate the rest of the fight and retain his title.
In addition to the main prize, there will also be 12 other awards on the night:
A review of the sporting year will be broadcast on BBC Cymru Wales during the festive period.
Please note the event is not connected with the UK Sports Personality of the Year and is for the Wales award only.
