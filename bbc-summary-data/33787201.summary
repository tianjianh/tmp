A senior figure involved in funding talks with the charity told BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith: "We were all over-ridden by Number 10."
Kids Company has told the government it will close its services on Wednesday evening.
It got Â£3m from ministers a week ago.
The source suggested officials and ministers at the Department for Education had repeatedly expressed opposition to continued funding for the charity because of concerns about its performance and management.
It is suggested such concerns were expressed as far back as 2012.
But, the source added: "She was a good news story for the Conservative Party. It was a case of glamour over substance."
Kids Company said closure speculation was "dangerous and irresponsible".
The Cabinet Office said it would not comment on whether the charity would close.
