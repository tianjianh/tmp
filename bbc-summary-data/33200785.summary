There will be fewer sailings available for TT fans during the 2016 motorcycling festival than this year, Isle of Man ferry operators have said.

The Steam Packet Company said this was because the P&O fast craft, which is usually chartered to deal with the busy period in June, will not be available.
A spokesman said timetable changes mean fewer sailings from Ireland and the UK.
He added: "Given the current situation, we expect to see a reduction in the total number of bikes we will carry."
The loss of the ship from the Manx fleet next year means fewer sailings from Ireland, Heysham and Liverpool.
"The Ben-my-Chree and Manannan [Steam Packet-owned ships] have already been scheduled to operate additional Belfast sailings to accommodate Irish fans heading to the races," said ferry chief Mark Woodward.
"Adding these extra Irish services means the number of sailings from Heysham and Liverpool is slightly reduced.
'We will keep looking for a replacement charter and have already approached several companies - none at present has indicated a willingness to release vessels".
