Stuart Broad suffered an injury scare after hurting his ankle on the first day of England's final Test warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis XI.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
England start the first of three Tests against the West Indies on Monday.
Seamer Broad, 28, slipped in his run-up in the second over of the day and returned to the field after receiving almost an hour of ice treatment.
England batsman Jonathan Trott, playing for St Kitts, was dismissed by James Anderson for a duck, edging to slip
Trott, Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow had been named in the hosts' batting line-up, with the aim of providing the England attack with a substantial test.
