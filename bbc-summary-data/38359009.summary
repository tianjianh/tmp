Scott Williams scored the only try of the game as Scarlets held on to win 22-21 in a tense finale.
Leigh Halfpenny could have won the game for Toulon but missed an 80th minute long-range penalty.
"The most relieved man was Wyn Jones as he came in the side of the ruck. It was a tough kick, 50/50," Pivac said.
"We talk about history and this club has got a fine history. Today we created some of our own so I am very satisfied."
The victory means Scarlets have now won their last seven consecutive games at Parc y Scarlets and Pivac said everything went to plan against Toulon.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Pivac said: "We did everything we wanted to do and that was to improve on the week before. At the start of the game the numbers were up for territory and possession.
"We created some good scoring opportunities including one really good one. We knew at half time we would be in for a real contest. That's how it proved to be and it was a very tough second half."
Scarlets lost 31-20 away against the French Top14 side a week before beating them on home soil and centre Scott Williams said they could still progress further in the competition thanks to the victory.
"We were steamrolled for 20 minutes in France last week. But we played with a higher tempo today," Williams told BBC Radio Wales.
"We are still in with a sniff, we knew we had to win today to give us any chance and we are looking forward to the fight and looking forward to the games in January."
