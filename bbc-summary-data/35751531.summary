[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Police were called to the western Sydney suburb of Riverstone on Tuesday morning after receiving reports of a man trying to cut down a power pole.
The 51-year-old man allegedly threw petrol at the officers as they approached him.
His clothes caught fire when the officers attempted to subdue him using a Taser and pepper spray.
After police extinguished the fire, the man ran to his house and barricaded himself inside.
About one hour later he came out of the house and surrendered to police.
He was treated for minor burns and a police officer whose eyes were splashed with petrol was also taken to hospital.
Police expect to lay charges against the man.
