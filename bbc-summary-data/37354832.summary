The Giants need to beat Hull KR at the KC Lightstream Stadium in the final round of The Qualifiers to avoid the Million Pound Game play-off.
The losers of that match will be at home to Salford or London Broncos in the play-off match on 1 October.
Danny Brough scored 14 points for the Giants as they survived a second-half Leeds revival to win at home.
Leeds, who lost acting captain Rob Burrow and prop Keith Galloway with leg injuries in the second half, host Leigh on Thursday in a match to decide top spot in the Qualifiers.
Huddersfield coach Rick Stone: "Obviously we know the equation now. It's like a sudden-death semi-final, although the winners won't go on.
"It will be interesting and a good challenge. We've got to win one of our next two games and I'd like to see us get it done next week so we can move on to next year.
"The boys have been put through the ringer this year but it's good to get some confidence out of playing a team like Leeds today."
Leeds Rhinos coach Brian McDermott: "We had some adversity before the game and we've got some busted bodies.
"It looks like Keith Galloway has snapped his Achilles and Rob Burrow and Jordan Lilley have knee knocks. I'm not sure what sort of team we'll be able to put out next week.
"I don't think at any stage our fellows have said 'it doesn't matter, we're in Super League next year'. We want to finish as strong as we can.
"We had too much defending to do in the first half. We got hammered by the penalty count and we dropped the ball as well.  We also played a very committed and strong Huddersfield team who had a lot to play for."
