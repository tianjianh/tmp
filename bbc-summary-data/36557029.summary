[SN]TITLE[SN]
Aberdeen engineering firm bought by Wood Group

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen engineering company which went into administration with the loss of more than 50 jobs has been bought by oil services company Wood Group.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Enterprise Engineering Services called in administrators last month following a significant drop in orders.
A total of 54 people were made redundant at its Aberdeen base, with four more in Caithness.
The remaining 10 employees will transfer to Wood Group and remain based at the company's Craigshaw Road HQ.
Enterprise Engineering Services, which has been trading since 1966, offers engineering services including design, fabrication, assembly, installation and inspection.
Administrators KPMG said that orders had dropped due to the "sustained drop in the price of oil".
