The 24-year-old from Runcorn became Britain's first champion in the event's 17-year history in 2016.
After winning gold in the season-opener in Switzerland earlier in April, she finished behind 18-year-old Janja Garnbret in Chongqing, China.
Coxsey still leads Slovenia's Garnbret in the overall rankings, with five more events to take place before August.
Japan's Akiyo Noguchi, 27, picked up bronze with third place.
"It was a hot and sweaty final," Coxsey wrote on Twitter. "I'm very happy to finish in second place. Massive congrats to Janja!"
Sport climbing - which includes bouldering - is one of five new sports confirmed for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
