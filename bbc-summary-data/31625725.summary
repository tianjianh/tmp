Limavady man jailed over 'unmerciful beating'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man from Limavady, County Londonderry, who subjected another man to "an unmerciful beating" has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
James Stephen Mullan, 35, from Kennaught Terrace in Limavady, admitted assaulting the man on 18 June 2014.
The court was told police were called to the injured man's address where he told them he had been assaulted.
He had noticeable injuries including a lump on his head.
He also received injuries around his eye and police sent him to hospital.
The victim told police he was walking along Kennaught Terrace in the town when the defendant approached him and said "I don't like you".
He then punched the man to the ground, bit his thumb and stamped on his head.
When police spoke to Mullan he admitted being involved in the incident and said he had punched the man four or five times.
A defence solicitor said it was "a very sad case" and added that his client accepted he should not have done what he did.
District judge Liam McNally said that Mullan had a bad record and he had to take into account the seriousness of the offence.
He said Mullan had subjected the man to "an unmerciful beating".
He was sentenced to five months in prison.
