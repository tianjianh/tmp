The south will have three teams, with one based at The Oval with Surrey, who pipped a joint bid by Middlesex and the MCC for the one London spot.
There will also be a team based in the south west and another in Hampshire.
The north will have two sides, in Lancashire and Yorkshire, while the Midlands team for the Twenty20 league will be at Loughborough University.
Loughborough is also the long-term base of the England women's team.
All six hosts have been awarded hosting rights for a four-year period from 2016-2019.
The tournament will be played in a Twenty20 format this season, before adding a 50-over competition in the future.
The group stage of the 2016 competition will run from 30 July to 14 August, with the top four teams qualifying for a finals day.
Further details, including team names, will be revealed at a later date.
"This is a key day in the creation of the Women's Cricket Super League," said England & Wales Cricket Board chief executive Tom Harrison.
"The bidding process for obtaining the hosts was competitive from the outset."
There were 28 initial expressions of interest for the WCSL.
