Police said "suspicious objects" had been found at Strand Road, County Londonderry, and at Magheralave Park South in Lisburn, County Antrim.
A hijacked vehicle was abandoned near Strand Road police station, according to a Democratic Unionist Party MLA.
The Lisburn alert was later declared a hoax. Residents have returned to their homes.
The security cordon was about 200 yards (180m) outside the gates of Thiepval barracks, according to a BBC eyewitness at the scene.
The alert in Derry began shortly before 23:00 GMT on Thursday.
Gary Middleton told BBC Radio Ulster that he understood a "suspicious device" had been left inside the hijacked vehicle and described it as a "terrorist act".
"It is very unfortunate that it happened on a night when the Christmas lights were switched on in the city, when there were lots of people out enjoying themselves," he said.
The DUP MLA for Foyle said it was not yet known who was responsible for the hijacking.
"When we see these types of acts, the fingers tend to be pointed at dissident republicans but, again, we're unsure as to the nature of this security alert.
"We do know that a vehicle has been hijacked but we're not too certain as to how serious the device is," Mr Middleton said.
Strand Road is closed at its junctions with Boating Club Lane and Clarendon Street.
Queen Street has also been closed between Clarendon Street and Asylum Road.  Traffic diversions are in place.
