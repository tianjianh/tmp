Extra carriages are being added to key train routes and ScotRail Alliance warned services would be very busy.
British Transport Police said extra officers would be on duty. Alcohol bans will be in place on many routes.
Additional security, including bag and body searches, will be in place at the stadium, the Scottish FA said.
Turnstiles will open earlier than usual to help with any delays.
There will also be a minute's silence ahead of kick-off as a tribute to recent terror attack victims.
The SFA said: "The safety of fans is of paramount importance to the Scottish FA and a range of measures will be implemented as part of an enhanced security operation.
"These increased security measures at Hampden Park will include bag and people searches, and may result in delays in entering the stadium.
"Fans should expect to be searched at the outer cordons at Aikenhead Road, Prospecthill Road, Mount Annan Drive, Somerville Drive and Letherby Drive, with additional bag searches at the turnstiles."
Tens of thousands of fans from across the UK will be at Hampden Park in Glasgow to watch the match.
Queuing systems will be in place at key locations and fans are being advised to leave plenty of time for their journey as they may not be able to board their first choice of train.
Scotland fans will be directed to Mount Florida station before and after the game, while England supporters will use King's Park.
Jacqueline Taggart, from ScotRail Alliance, said: "We want everyone to have a great time at the match but, more importantly, to stay safe.
"With this in mind, police and extra staff will be on hand to assist at key locations across our network. Please help them to help you by following their instructions.
"We'll be doing all we can to get fans to and from the match. You can play your part by planning your journey now - remember not to leave it to the last train of the night to get home, as all trains are going to be very busy."
Ms Taggart said fans should also book their tickets now rather than buying them on the day.
British Transport Police said they had been planning for months alongside Police Scotland and train operators.
Ch Sup John McBride, who is leading the operation for British Transport Police, said: "This is a mighty event for both teams and we're looking forward to welcoming spectators as they arrive in Glasgow. Our policing operation will stretch the breadth of the nation and will involve a large number of officers.
"We want spectators to have a fun and enjoyable journey towards this match and will be on hand if they need assistance.
"Likewise, we will also be taking a zero-tolerance approach towards any individuals or groups who exhibit anti-social or criminal behaviour. There is no place for hooligan or intimidating behaviour and we will be taking firm action against those who are out to cause trouble."
