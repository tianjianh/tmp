[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
New Wolves boss Paul Lambert began his reign with a goalless draw against Preston North End at Deepdale.

After a tight first half, most of the chances came after the break, North End creating the majority of them.
But Aiden McGeady's angled shot hit the side-netting and then Jordan Hugill wasted a great chance to win it, firing over in the fifth minute of added time.
That left Lambert with the same opening result as Kenny Jackett, one of his Wolves predecessors, in August 2013.
After a disappointing match of eight bookings, Simon Grayson's Preston stay 11th but, despite a first clean sheet since 17 September, Wolves remain 19th, having stretched their winless run to eight games.
Wolves, missing Wales midfielder David Edwards through suspension, went close through George Saville, who shot narrowly wide, while Jon Dadi Bodvarsson's overhead kick flew just over and substitute Nouha Dicko put a late header straight at home goalkeeper Chris Maxwell.
But former North End keeper Andy Lonergan made a key save for Wolves at Hugill's feet just after Paul Gallagher had volleyed over.
Hugill also headed wide, while Simon Makienok headed just over as the hosts stretched their recent encouraging run to one defeat in nine league games.
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "We knew it would be a tough game for us with the new manager coming in.
"Out of respect for us they've stopped our key players playing like they have been doing. We still had some good opportunities though.
"Wolves have been too open over the last few months. Paul has done his homework knowing that we can be a handful. Credit to Wolves, they made it hard for us."

Wolves manager Paul Lambert: "I thought we gave as good as we got. I was delighted with the lads.
"We have a threat going forward but we have to be stronger at the back than we have in the last few months. So I decided to come here and be strong.
"No slight on Walter Zenga, but the whole team has been too wide open and you can't defend like that. The way we defended was terrific. Andy Lonergan didn't really make a save."
