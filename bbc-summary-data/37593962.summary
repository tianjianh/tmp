[SN]TITLE[SN]
Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Colchester United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tommy Rowe struck in first-half injury-time as promotion-chasing Doncaster edged past Colchester 1-0 to secure a third consecutive League Two win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was far from a comfortable afternoon for high-flying Rovers against a side that had failed to win in their previous five matches.
But Rowe scored in the last seconds of the first half to give Doncaster something to work with after the break. The midfielder latched onto the ball after a fine dummy from John Marquis and clipped a shot over Colchester goalkeeper Sam Walker.
The visitors had done a superb job to stifle Doncaster's passing game with high-intensity pressing in midfield.
And Colchester arguably had the more dangerous chances. Chris Porter rose unmarked but headed straight at Marko Marosi a matter of seconds before Doncaster took the lead.
Marquis really should have doubled the advantage in the second half. Inexplicably left unmarked standing just inside his own half, the striker latched onto a long clearance and attempted to round Walker but saw his shot cleared off the line by Richard Brindley.
Colchester piled on the pressure in the latter stages but Doncaster held firm.
