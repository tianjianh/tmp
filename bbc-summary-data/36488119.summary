Marie Laurie, 57, from Easterhouse, had just got into a taxi with her husband when it was struck by a car which was being chased by police.
Steven Bennie appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Wednesday charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
He made no plea or declaration and was granted bail.
Mr Bennie, who is from Glasgow, was also charged with drink driving and driving while disqualified, uninsured or without a licence.
The case was referred to the Police Complaints and Review Commissioner (Pirc) which has since given its report to the Crown Office.
At the time, Mrs Laurie's niece Michelle said the family had been enjoying "an amazing day" at the wedding.
"She was happy. We're just so glad that we got to spend that day with her," she said.
