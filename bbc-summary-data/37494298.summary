[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Detectives investigating a fatal attack on a Lancashire man are appealing for three people who walked the same route home as him to come forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Raich Alcock, 52, made his way from Accrington town centre to Arnold Street at about 03:30 BST on 6 September.
Lancashire Police said he collapsed when he got home after sustaining a serious head injury. Detectives believe this either happened on the way home or at his house.
He died in hospital 10 days later.
Police want to trace two men and a woman who walked the same route - from near Accrington town hall, across Eastgate and Friar Court, to Dowry Street.
Det Insp Tim McDermott said: "We are trying to establish exactly what happened to Mr Alcock, from making that journey home to being found collapsed at his home later that morning after sustaining a serious head injury which later proved fatal.
"We need anyone who may have seen him - the people described or knows anything that could help us with our investigation - to get in touch at their earliest opportunity."
Christopher Singleton, 37, from Derby Street, Accrington has appeared at Preston Crown Court charged with Mr Alcock's murder.
He has been remanded in custody to appear at the same court on 25 November for a plea and case management hearing.
A 44-year-old Accrington man, arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting murder, has been released without charge.
