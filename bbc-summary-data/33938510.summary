She also urged members "not to give up on your principles" in choosing Ed Miliband's successor.
Ms Cooper, Andy Burnham, Liz Kendall or Jeremy Corbyn will be the new leader following a vote next month.
Speaking in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, Ms Cooper said some party members wrongly believed  they must choose between their "head and their heart".
Over 70 people attended the meeting at Connah's Quay Labour Club on Friday.
