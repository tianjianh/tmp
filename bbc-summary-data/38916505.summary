A cache of anti-tank grenades from World War Two has been destroyed in a controlled explosion after being found on a building site in Wiltshire.

A bomb squad was called at about 16:00 GMT on Wednesday after the incendiary devices were dug up by builders in Wingfield Road, Trowbridge.
The phosphorus grenades had to be removed from heavy clay soil before being exploded at just after midnight.
Residents nearby were warned to stay indoors with windows and doors shut.
Phosphorus grenades were issued to the Home Guard during World War Two.
The devices were used as improvised anti-tank weapons when Britain was facing possible invasion following the evacuation from Dunkirk.
During the controlled explosion Wingfield Road was closed to traffic but has since reopened.
