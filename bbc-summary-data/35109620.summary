Crews were called to the property in Penrallt, Saron, near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, at about 16:50 GMT on Tuesday.
Shortly after, they recovered the man's body in the heavily smoke-logged home.
North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said investigators would return to the house on Wednesday to determine how the fire started.
