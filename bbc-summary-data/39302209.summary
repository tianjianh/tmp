[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
England Under-21s continued their preparations for this summer's European Championship with a convincing victory over Denmark in Randers.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ruben Loftus-Cheek scored twice, and Solly March and Cauley Woodrow were also on target, as England swept aside another team to have qualified for June's tournament in Poland.
It followed Sunday's underwhelming 1-0 loss against Germany.
England face holders Sweden in their tournament opener on 16 June.
Chelsea midfielder Loftus-Cheek, a second-half substitute against Germany, was the central figure against the Danes.
He opened the scoring by slotting in Jacob Murphy's low cross, and completed the rout by finishing off a pass from Jack Grealish.
In between, March curled in a superb left-footed strike from the corner of the area, and Woodrow turned in Kortney Hause's knockdown.
"I didn't underestimate the opposition," coach Aidy Boothroyd told BT Sport. "They are at the European finals so it makes it even more special to get the result we did.
"Ruben was terrific. But the reason he was terrific is he had 10 other players who worked really hard for him.
"He still has things to do in certain aspects of his game, but they all do."
