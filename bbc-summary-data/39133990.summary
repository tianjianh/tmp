Sibley, 28, lives near the University of Nottingham's Â£40m sports village, which is hosting the National Championships from Friday until Sunday.
She told BBC East Midlands Today: "I've won it five times but lost last year so I'm ready to win the title back.
"It's brilliant such a big event is being hosted here. I'm very excited."
