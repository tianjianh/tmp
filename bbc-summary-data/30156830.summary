[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Arbroath's Simon Murray grabbed a hat-trick to end Bo'ness United's cup dream in an emphatic win at Newtown Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The East Region Junior side held out for 28 minutes before Murray's close-range finish broke the deadlock.
Paul McManus began a second-half goal deluge when he netted from six yards for the League Two leaders.
Murray grabbed his second after being teed up by Kevin Nicoll and added his third in the 75th minute before McManus found the bottom corner a minute later.
The part-timers had a chance to give the majority of the 1,769 crowd something to cheer late on only for Stuart Hunter to head over.
