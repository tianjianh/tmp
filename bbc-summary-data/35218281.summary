Six Nations: George Kruis says favouritism will not affect selection

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens second row George Kruis does not want "favouritism" to be a factor if he is selected by England for their Six Nations campaign.

The 25-year-old was nurtured by Steve Borthwick when the recently appointed Red Rose forwards coach was captain at the Premiership club.
Sarries director of rugby Mark McCall has described Kruis as a "shoo-in" for the opener in Scotland on 6 February.
"If I do get selected it would be off my own back," said Kruis.
"Steve was a mentor for me definitely. When you play for five years alongside a player like that you learn a few things off him. But he is another coach and that is the way it is.
"There will be no favouritism and I would not want it to be like that."
Kruis has already won 10 caps, the last coming against Uruguay at the World Cup in September.
The 6ft 6in-player was named man-of-the-match in Saracens' 26-6 victory over Leicester on Saturday - a match watched by Borthwick.
