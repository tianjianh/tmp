In the video (which is in Dutch), an eagle is seen swooping towards a hovering drone, grabbing hold of the machine with its talons and flying off.
The birds are taught to treat the drones as if they were a potential meal.
"The bird sees the drone as prey and takes it to a safe area, a place where he does not suffer from other birds or humans," says a statement from the police.
