Walsall striker Amadou Bakayoko has signed a new one-year contract with the League One club.

He follows the lead of midfielder Kieron Morris, who signed a new deal on Wednesday.
Bakayoko, 20, who has been with the club since he was 16, missed the end of the season with a knee injury.
"It's about getting fit through the summer now because next season is a big season for me," Bakayoko told the club website.
"There are high expectations at this club and I really want to step up and become a big part it.
"There's lots of young players who have been given a chance here. I'm in the same age group as Liam Kinsella and Rico Henry and we really push each other on."
Bakayoko has had three separate loan spells with non-league clubs, first at Southport, then last season at AFC Telford United and fellow National League North side Worcester City.
Highly-rated Henry, 18, has been called up to represent England Under-19s against Mexico in June, replacing Manchester United's Cameron Borthwick-Jackson.
This third international call for the Saddlers' young player of the season comes on top of his three goals in 44 appearances as a first-team regular during the 2015-16 season.
