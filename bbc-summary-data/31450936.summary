Captain Charlotte Edwards top-scored with 65 in a total of 194 all out with four balls left of their 50 overs.
New Zealand lost wickets regularly and were 104 all out with Anya Shrubsole taking four for 36.
The tourists, who lost the first match by 67 runs, will look to make it two wins at the same venue on Sunday.
Shrubsole said: "We were not up to scratch the other day and were determined to come here and put in a great performance and a win on the board, so it's a happy dressing room.
"I've not bowled brilliantly on the trip so owed the girls a bit in terms of wickets. Charlotte threw me the ball and showed faith in me and thankfully it paid off for me."
The first three games of this five-match series count towards the International Cricket Council's Women's Championship, which determines qualification for the 2017 World Cup.
