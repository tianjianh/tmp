[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The number of new businesses opening accounts with Scotland's major lenders last year was down on the 2014 figure.

The figures point to a sharp drop in the number of new firms operating in the oil and gas sector.
That energy category, known to statisticians as "mining and quarrying", dropped from 215 to 99 start-up businesses.
The total number of start-ups, compiled by the four main banks in the Scottish market, was down 1%, to 11,669.
The Committee of Scottish Bankers reported a 2% drop in the final quarter, compared with the last three months of 2014.
By region, Aberdeen city and Aberdeenshire saw a drop in new companies from 1539 to 1382.
The east of Scotland was the only other region to report a fall, from  3139 to 2956.
Measured by council area, Edinburgh saw a fall but it was Glasgow that stood out for a significant drop compared with 2014 - down from 1468 to 1,330 new firms.
The decline of urban start-ups registered in these statistics may be partly explained by growing competition for business banking from lenders with a smaller presence in the Scottish market.
The Committee of Scottish Bankers includes Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, Clydesdale and TSB.  It does not include HSBC, Barclays or Nationwide.
According to the four main Scottish-based banks, most regions of Scotland saw a small increase in start-up business, except in the south of Scotland, where new firms registered by the bankers were up from 477 to 600.
One of the biggest business categories, recreation and personal services, fell from 1686 to 1382.
Adding most new firms was the real estate sector, rising from 3,186 to 3,371 start-up accounts.
There was a drop of 500 in the number of sole traders registering with banks, while the number of legally-constituted companies was on the rise.
