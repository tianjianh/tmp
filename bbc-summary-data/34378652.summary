[SN]TITLE[SN]
Swiss authorities will probe the fixing of metal prices

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Authorities in Switzerland have announced a probe into global banks over the suspected manipulation of the price of precious metals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Swiss Competition Commission (Comco) said it will investigate seven banks including HSBC and UBS.
Comco said it had "indications" that the banks had "possibly concluded illegal competition defying deals".
US authorities have already sued several banks for metal price fixing.
Comco said its investigation will include Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Mitsui, and Swiss bank Julius Baer, over what it said were "possible price fixing deals, especially in connection with spreads".
A "spread" is the difference between the bidding price and actual price of a commodity or other asset.
Trading in gold, silver, platinum and palladium is where the Swiss regulator is focusing its attention.
HSBC is already involved in a case of metal price-fixing in New York, where it is amongst several companies which were accused of having conspired since 2007 to rig the twice-daily platinum and palladium fixings.
