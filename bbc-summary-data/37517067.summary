The makers of the James Bond films want Daniel Craig to remain in the 007 role, one of their executive producers says.

Callum McDougall, who has worked on nine Bonds, said Craig was "absolutely the first choice" of series producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson.
"I know they're hoping for him to come back," McDougall told Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.
Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, where many of the Bond films were shot, is celebrating its 80th birthday.

The facility has been a significant part of the British film industry since opening in 1936.
Craig, 48, made his debut as Bond in 2006's Casino Royale, returning to the role in Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre.
He has yet to commit to another instalment, prompting speculation as to who might replace him.
Asked on Friday morning who would be the next James Bond, McDougall said: "I wish I knew."
But he insisted the role was "absolutely" Craig's should he choose to continue as Ian Fleming's legendary spy.
Pinewood Studios was founded when Charles Boot, a builder with movie ambitions, bought Heatherden Hall and its estate in 1934.
A year later, Boot met J Arthur Rank and the two became partners in the studio project, releasing their first film, London Melody, in 1936.
The James Bond movies have a long history with Pinewood, beginning with the first Bond movie, Dr No, in 1962.
In addition to the Bond franchise, Pinewood has hosted Superman, Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Carry On films.
"It's literally a dream factory," said McDougall, who has been a part of the Bond "family" since The Living Daylights in 1987. "People will be staggered by the films we've made here."
