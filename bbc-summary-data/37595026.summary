Adams became the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal when she triumphed at London 2012.
The 33-year-old from Yorkshire won the flyweight title again in Rio this year, the first British boxer to defend an Olympic crown for 92 years.
Asked about her future, she told the BBC: "If I was to go professional I could definitely break boundaries."
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, Adams added: "I've had a few chats with quite a few promoters and I still need to think about what I really want to do.
"There is also Tokyo [Olympics in 2020] and acting which I'd love to pursue, but the professional boxing world would be a big challenge. Who knows, we could have a new world champion."
Adams highlighted the successful transition of former Olympic judo bronze medallist Ronda Rousey to Mixed Martial Arts, where she won the UFC bantamweight world title.
"Before her there weren't that many female MMA fighters anybody knew," Adams said.
"For me, coming from amateur boxing, people already know my name. I've already got a big following and if I take that into professional boxing that could change the game forever."
Adams was asked about British world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, who could lose his boxing licence after revealing he took cocaine in an attempt to help deal with depression.
Fury, 28, also claimed he had retired on 3 October, only to retract the comment three hours later.
"With Team GB we have everything; doctors, nutritionists, psychologists - everything you could think of - and we don't need to worry about anything," Adams said.
"Maybe there needs to be that in the professional game, someone they can talk to.
