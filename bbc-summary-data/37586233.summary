[SN]TITLE[SN]
£6.2m VAT unclaimed by fire service for three years

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A mistake by one of Wales' fire services meant £6.2m in VAT receipts were unclaimed for almost three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Businesses can reclaim VAT paid for goods and services from HMRC.
It emerged at a Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service fire authority meeting last Thursday that £6.2m went unclaimed up to March 2016.
The authority's assistant chief officer, Elizabeth Aitken, said no VAT money was lost and "the whole of this amount has now been claimed".
The meeting was told the outstanding amount did not have an impact on the fire service's budget.
Staff sickness and the changeover of employees in the fire service's financial department were among the reasons give for the error.
When staff realised the problem, money had to be borrowed to cover the shortfall, meaning the fire authority paid £46,000 in interest.
