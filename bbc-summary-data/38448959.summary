The "In with a Bang" display, near Hull Marina, will mark the beginning of Hull's year as UK City of Culture.
Managers of the Humber Bridge said it does not have the resource to manage a large number of people.
The bridge's east footpath will be closed until 20:30 GMT on 1 January.

The fireworks display, which is a free ticketed event, takes place between 20:17 and 20:30.
The Humber Bridge Board said it feared thousands of people could turn up to watch the show from the elevated position the bridge affords.
Peter Hill, the general manager of the bridge, said: "Unfortunately, that is something we simply do not have the resources to manage so it would be irresponsible of us to facilitate a situation whereby that could occur."
In with a Bang has been organised by the City of Culture company. It is a ticket only event that will start with entertainment from 7.30pm.
