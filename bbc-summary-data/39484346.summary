Swansea City top scorer Fernando Llorente is "touch and go" to return from an ankle injury for Wednesday's visit of Spurs at the Liberty Stadium.

The Spanish World Cup winner was missed by the Swans in Sunday's 0-0 draw with fellow strugglers Middlesbrough.
And manager Paul Clement, who says he will make changes, does not believe Llorente will be fit to start.
"I think we have to think about him as maybe making an impact from the bench if required," said Clement.
Llorente, 32, has scored 11 goals this season since his arrival from La Liga side Sevilla in the summer.
Clement said he would also bear in mind the Swans' trip to West Ham United on Saturday as he decides on whether to play the centre forward.
Though Llorente is responding to treatment Clement said: "I think it would be difficult for him to start on Wednesday if he managed to get through and was fit.
"I don't think he is going to be 100 per cent fit and that is not necessarily talking about the ankle. When you have not trained for a few days you do lose a bit of physical conditioning."
Clement created Swansea City history on Sunday by not making any substitutions - the first time that has happened during the club's Premier League spell.
Club record signing Borja Baston and young striker Oliver McBurnie were unused on the bench, as was returning winger Jefferson Montero.

Clement said former Atletico Madrid front runner Borja, who has only played 39 minutes of Premier League football since Clement took over in January, has to be ready for action, and insists he does have faith in his fringe players.
He insisted: "I have faith in Borja, he would not be on the bench if I did not. I think he can have an impact, I have to decide if guys on bench can make a difference," he explained.
"Borja is training very well. Oliver McBurnie has been back involved again and they just have to keep doing their thing and when I call upon them, be ready to take their opportunity.
"That could be on Wednesday or it could be on Saturday."
