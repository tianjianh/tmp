The Spaniard, who takes over from Manuel Pellegrini, led Bayern to three Bundesliga titles and two German Cups in his three seasons in charge.
Italian boss Carlo Ancelotti will be making his home debut for Bayern in the match at the Allianz Arena.
City will face Manchester United in a friendly in Beijing five days later.
"Bayern will provide fitting opposition as our team continues its pre-season preparations and we will be able to connect with our fans in Germany," said City chief executive Ferran Soriano.
On Sunday, club chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said Guardiola will take the Premier League club "to a new level".
