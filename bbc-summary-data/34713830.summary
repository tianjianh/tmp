Plans for third lane on Britannia Bridge shelved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for a third lane on the Britannia Bridge to resolve congestion over the Menai Strait have been shelved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Transport Minister Edwina Hart said a third lane would be "less safe" than the existing two lanes.
In a letter to Ynys Mon AM, Rhun ap Iorwerth, Mrs Hart said a new bridge would resolve the congestion issues on Britannia Bridge.
A Welsh government spokesman confirmed it was developing a business case for a third crossing.
Mr ap Iorwerth said he was pleased at the news and called for a "big push" to deal with the congestion.
The Plaid Cymru AM, who has campaigned for a new bridge, said the current set up was "economically damaging" and ran the risk of "Anglesey becoming cut off".
