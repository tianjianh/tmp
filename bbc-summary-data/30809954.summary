Weston General reopens two wards after norovirus outbreak

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two wards at a Somerset hospital have been reopened to admissions after an outbreak of norovirus at the end of December.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There was an initial outbreak at Weston General Hospital before Christmas and then a fresh outbreak afterwards.
Uphill and Berrow wards are now both open and the Ashcombe maternity unit is fully open for expectant mothers.
A third ward, Kewstoke remains closed and still has restrictions in place, hospital bosses said.
When there was an increase in emergency admissions over the Christmas and new year period,  eight out of 12 beds in the maternity unit were used for admissions but now it has returned to being fully used by the maternity unit.
