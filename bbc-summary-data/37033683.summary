The number of marriages in Gretna topped 3,500 last year - a slight rise compared with the previous 12 months.

A National Records of Scotland report said the Dumfries and Galloway village remained a "popular venue".
There were 3,511 marriages registered in 2015 compared with 3,499 in 2014.
However, last year's total is more than a third down on the record total for Gretna which dates back to 2004 when there were 5,555 weddings.
Nonetheless, it can still claim to be the "marriage capital" of Scotland and accounts for 12% of all weddings.
It is particularly popular for "tourism marriages" and some 84% of the weddings held in Gretna last year did not involve a resident in Scotland.
