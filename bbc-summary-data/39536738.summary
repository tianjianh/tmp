Defender Darren McGregor looped home a header then flicked in a Jason Cummings corner before the interval.
Cummings was the supplier again as captain David Gray squeezed in a header early in the second half.
With nearest challengers Falkirk drawing at home to St Mirren, Neil Lennon's men cannot be caught with three games remaining.
A crowd of 17,056 turned up for the Easter Road party, ending a period of three seasons in the second tier for the Edinburgh club.
Having drawn four of their past five games, there was no sign of any malaise as the hosts started in whirlwind fashion, with John McGinn and Martin Boyle having early chances.
But the Dumfries side showed they were not simply making up the numbers as Dominic Thomas fired just wide from 18 yards.
The breakthrough came on 13 minutes as McGinn floated a free-kick to the back post, where McGregor sent a header arcing over the outstretched arms of Lee Robinson and into the net.
It was the centre-half's first goal of the season and the huge home support roared their approval.
They were then infuriated by referee Barry Cook, who called back play when Cummings was clean through on goal. Queens midfielder John Rankin was booked for a challenge on Andrew Shinnie but, rather than playing advantage, Cook blew his whistle.
The visitors almost drew level when former Hibee Stephen Dobbie got on the end of a mishit shot by Thomson, but Ofir Marciano pulled off a magnificent stop.
Robinson then denied the home side a second with a wonderful save from a Boyle shot but, moments later, Lennon's side doubled their advantage.
Cummings sent in a corner that was met by the right boot of McGregor for his and his team's second of the day.
The home side continued to drive forward and scored number three just after the break.
Robinson did well to parry away another Cummings volley but, from the corner, Gray rose above the Doonhamers' defence to nod in at the back post.
Hibernian introduced Alex Harris and James Keatings but, despite carving out more openings, they could not add to their tally.
The home players left to a standing ovation and the Scottish Cup holders can now look forward to next weekend's semi-final with Aberdeen at Hampden.
