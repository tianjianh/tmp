[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Capt Lionel Queripel is one of 10 Victoria Cross holders associated with the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent.
The 24-year-old was killed at the Battle of Arnhem in the German-occupied Netherlands in September 1944.
The plaque outside his home in Warwick Park, Tunbridge Wells, was unveiled by his nephew Phil Robinson.
In 2007, Queripel Close, in the High Brooms area of the town, was named after him.
Thousands of lives were lost on both sides in the fighting in the Battle of Arnhem, which was the inspiration for the film A Bridge Too Far.
The aim of Operation Market Garden was to take strategic bridges near Arnhem, but the Allies underestimated the number of German troops lying in wait  and it failed.
More than 1,400 Allied troops died and more than 6,000 were captured by German forces.
Cpt Queripel was a member of the Royal Sussex Regiment attached to the Parachute Regiment, and was in charge of a company of men advancing on Arnhem under heavy and continuous enemy fire, during which he was fatally wounded.
His citation for the Victoria Cross said: "During the whole period of nine hours of confused and bitter fighting Captain Queripel displayed the highest standard of gallantry under the most difficult and trying circumstances."
"His courage, leadership and devotion to duty were magnificent and an inspiration to all," it added.
He is buried in the Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery.
His mother, who described him as "just an ordinary boy", presented his medals to the Parachute Regiment in 1972.
They can be seen at the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, Cambridgeshire.
His sword is on display at the Royal Sussex Regiment Museum in Eastbourne, East Sussex.
