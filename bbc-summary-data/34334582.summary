[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for 3,200 new homes in Leicestershire, described by opponents as "unviable", have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The estate, to include schools, shops, an industrial estate and traveller sites will be built on green field land between Loughborough and Shepshed.
Garendon Park and Countryside Protection Group, who oppose the plans, intend to apply for a judicial review.
Charnwood Borough Council's planning committee said the "right decision" has been made.
Opposition group member Neil McHugh, who has fought the plans for years and lives opposite the approved development, said he had "concerns of safety" over traffic build-up and noise pollution.
Some campaigners against the proposal were "outraged" and described the decision as "disgusting".
Councillor Sandy Forrest, vice-chair of the committee, said: "There have been many objections, feelings have run very high over it and a lot of people will be very disappointed.
"It wasn't an easy application to decide... in the end we've made the right decision."
The committee voted 10-2 in favour of the Garendon Estate development after more than four hours of deliberation.
Last November, Aa Â£445m development for 4,500 new homes was approved to address a housing shortage.
The site between Barkby and Thurmaston, which is around 12 miles away from the new site, will be Leicestershire's largest single housing development.
