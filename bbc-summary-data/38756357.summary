Allen played for Brisbane City in his native Australia after a spell with the Sky Blues in 2015.
Teenage full-back Kerr joins the Showgrounds club on loan from Premiership champions Crusaders.
"We want a squad that has competition for places all over the pitch and we've done that in two positions," said United boss David Jeffrey.
"I'm absolutely delighted to also sign Timothy Allen initially to the end of the season," Jeffrey told the club website.
"He is fondly remembered by supporters from his first spell here and the club obviously held positive memories for him as he made it known to us first that he was returning from Australia.
"When we looked at the squad we could see that we had no cover at right back, and although we have played Anthony Kane in there, our preferred position for him would be in midfield.
"We scouted around the league and Michael came very highly recommended.
"He has featured in some prominent matches for Crusaders this season despite his age, and he is a young man making his way up into top flight football."
Meanwhile striker Declan O'Brien has joined Carrick Rangers after being released by Glenavon.
O'Brien scored 24 goals in 48 appearances for the Lurgan Blues.
