The off-duty police officer from South Wales Police was hit by the X11 bus on The Kingsway shortly before 11:25 BST on Tuesday.
The 41-year-old mother-of-three was airlifted to the city's Morriston Hospital where she later died.
Her eight-year-old daughter suffered minor injuries in the incident.
Sgt Lucas was based at Llanishen police station in Cardiff where she ran neighbourhood policing teams.
Warm tributes have been paid to the popular officer.
Steve Trigg, chair of the South Wales Police Federation who had known her for a number of years, said: "She was really well respected.
"It is just a huge loss to her family, her friends and to South Wales Police."
"Our thoughts are with all her family and friends at this difficult time."
Earlier on Tuesday, a spokeman for First Cymru Bus said: "The exact cause of the incident is not yet known, but this will be fully investigated. Our team is currently working with the police to establish exactly what happened."
A business owner, based near the scene, said the current road system was "confusing" with a two-way carriageway one side and a one-way carriageway the other.
Swansea council dropped the speed limit to 20mph last year as an initial response to calls for improved safety.
More than 2,200 people signed a petition calling for changes, including a return to a traditional two-way system on The Kingsway.
There have been a number of accidents on the road over the last few years and in September 2013, Daniel Foss, 37, from Reynoldston, Gower, died after being struck by a National Express bus.
South Wales Police is continuing to investigate and witnesses are asked to call 101.
