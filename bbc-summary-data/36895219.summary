One-Day Cup: Liam Livingstone makes 98 as Lancashire beat Derbyshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lancashire's Liam Livingstone hit a career-best 98 to help his side beat Derbyshire in the One-Day Cup.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Livingstone looked certain to reach a maiden century when he was out lbw to Alex Hughes as Lancashire made 281-8.
Skipper Steven Croft also chipped in with 68 while Ben Cotton took 3-62.
Billy Godleman (91) looked to be leading Derbyshire home, but was dismissed by Croft with 101 needed off 82 balls, and the hosts ended on 254-9 to lose by 27 runs.
Godleman had barely offered a false shot in his 98-ball innings when he played around a straight one from spinner Croft to fall nine short of his second List A hundred and leave Derbyshire 180-4.
The chase lost all momentum thereafter, Kyle Jarvis keeping things tight to finish with 4-31.
Earlier, England Lions batsman Livingstone hammered six fours and three sixes in his run-a-ball knock and shared a fourth-wicket stand of 133 with Croft who hit three maximums himself.
Both fell in quick succession in the final 10 overs, but Jordan Clark clubbed two huge sixes in his 29 to take the Red Rose county to a competitive score.
Derbyshire's misery was compounded by wicketkeeper Harvey Hosein fracturing his thumb while Lancashire were batting.
