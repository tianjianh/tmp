[SN]TITLE[SN]
Guernsey public sector pension talks extension approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A final attempt will be made to negotiate a settlement on changes to Guernsey's public sector pensions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
States members agreed to a further three months of talks before any legal action is taken to resolve the three-and-a-half year long dispute.
It follows a protest march by about a thousand States employees against legal action without further negotiation.
Deputy Chief Minister Allister Langlois said after such a long time a solution was needed one way or another.
He said: "The Policy Council is aware of two strongly competing views - firstly, the need to bring this long-running issue to an end, and secondly, the overriding preference of everyone to reach a solution acceptable to both parties.
"The preference has always been for an agreement but in three and a half years of effort that has not proved possible."
Deputy Langlois suggested holding off on any legal action at the request of the Association of States Employees' Organisations in a bid to reach an agreement.
The States approved this change, but agreed if no deal could be reached by the end of July then court action would follow.
