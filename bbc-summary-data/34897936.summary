It's in Morocco in North Africa and uses the sun's warmth to melt salt and create energy.
The equivalent of 35 football fields full of moveable mirrors are pointed to the sky, so they can track the sun throughout the day.
Once complete, the plant will be able to provide energy to one million people.
The plant is part of Morocco's pledge to get 42% of its electricity from renewable energy by 2020.
Watch Martin's report to learn more about how it works.
