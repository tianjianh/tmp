A pet cat has survived eight days in the post, trapped in a box of DVDs.

Cupcake climbed into the parcel before it was taped up and sent 250 miles from Cornwall to West Sussex - leaving her owner "looking everywhere" for her.
The pair were reunited after the Siamese cat was unwrapped in Worthing and had her microchip scanned.
Owner Julie Baggott said it was "a miracle" her pet survived the jaunt, which vets said left her dehydrated and scared but otherwise unhurt.
"When I realised she was missing, it was the most horrible, scary feeling. We looked everywhere for her," she said.
"I feel terrible about what's happened, because I put everything in the box and sealed it straight away so I don't how she managed to get in there."
Ms Baggott, from Falmouth, said it was a "pretty big box" but thankfully Cupcake had a "really laid-back personality".
She said she thought Cupcake, an indoor cat, had managed to get out of the house.
"We made posters and walked miles across fields, forests and woods looking for her.
"All the neighbours got involved and people were spreading the word around."
Ms Baggott said she couldn't believe it when her family received a phone call to say Cupcake had been found.
"It was a miracle because she was alive and she's managed to survive that awful ordeal."
Vet Ben Colwell, from Grove Lodge Veterinary Hospital, said: "She was quite dehydrated, obviously really quite scared, quite nervous, but she's done really, really well.
"She's responded to fluids really well. Luckily, she was microchipped."
The vet's blog said staff scanned the "gorgeous girl" when she arrived and added: "Everyone was delighted and even more so when we found that the contact details were up to date and we were able to contact her owners straight away."
