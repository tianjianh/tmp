[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former Scottish Television boss has been appointed chairman of the arts body Creative Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Richard Findlay takes over from Sir Sandy Crombie who resigned from the post in April last year.
Following its creation in the summer of 2010, the organisation has faced criticism including from a number of leading writers and artists.
Last year Creative Scotland published a 10-year plan which promised a simpler funding process.
Mr Findlay, who chaired STV group from 2007 until 2013, said he was "absolutely delighted" to be appointed to the role.
He added: "Having watched the achievements of the organisation since its inception, as well as the challenges it has faced, I feel I am joining at an exciting and pivotal time.
"I very much look forward to working with the board, everyone at Creative Scotland and the culture sector more broadly, to deliver this ambition over the coming years."
Experience 'unparalleled'
Mr Findlay graduated from the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.
He has held senior posts in the media in the UK and Ireland and chaired the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh for six years in the 1990s.
The Edinburgh resident was made a CBE for services to the arts and creative industries in 2013 and currently chairs an online educational apps company based in London.
Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Europe and External Affairs, Fiona Hyslop, said: "Richard's experience in the sector, in the media, screen and theatre, are unparalleled and he has a real understanding of the issues facing our arts organisations today.
"Richard will lead Creative Scotland from strength to strength, supporting and challenging the organisation as it delivers on its ambitious 10-year plan."
