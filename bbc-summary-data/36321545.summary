Jarvis removed Kumar Sangakkara and Steven Davies for a duck in the space of three balls as Surrey fell to 20-3.
Zimbabwe-born paceman Jarvis also dismissed Jason Roy and Ben Foakes cheaply during a devastating spell.
Surrey opener Rory Burns fought gallantly, but was last man out for 92 as Surrey were all out for 191, before Lancashire reached stumps on 16-0.
The wickets of Sri Lanka great Sangakkara, leg before wicket, and Davies, caught behind, in just the eighth over set the tone for a difficult day for the visitors.
New Zealand paceman Neil Wagner also chipped in with three wickets to wrap up the innings after tea.
Red Rose all-rounder Tom Smith remained unbeaten at the close, as he made his first class comeback from a long-term back injury, alongside youngster Haseeb Hameed.
Lancashire bowler Kyle Jarvis told BBC Manchester:
"Tom Bailey started it off and then to knock them over the way we did was fantastic. The pitch looked like it had something in it this morning, and then it's flattened out nicely.
"I haven't got as many wickets as I'd like in the first few games, but I've been bowling well. I knew a big haul was just around the corner. I'm really happy.
"I've been bowling tight at the other end and other guys have been getting wickets. We have a stat that it's been 35-45 per cent maidens so far this season, which is huge. Instead of teams getting 300, they are getting 180."
Surrey's Rory Burns told BBC Radio London:
"You win the toss and obviously don't want to be bowled out for 191. It's quite a disappointing effort in a lot of ways, but we can make 191 look like a lot bigger score.
"It's down to us to bowl well, like we did in that short period, and push the game. If you group it in good areas, we've seen it's done a bit all day. It's swung, nipped and quite a few have kept low.
"I've been looking for that for a couple of weeks. It's nice to get some runs, contribute and do my thing. To end up with 92 was very nice, but disappointing at the same time."
