The scooter Danny Glass was riding on with Sophie Emma Rose Anderson collided with a truck in Phuket on 8 May.
Mr Glass, 29, originally from Margate, escaped serious injury.
Now he and the lorry driver Natt Awut Timsue are to be charged with causing death by reckless driving, Thai police said.
Mr Glass - who lived in Thailand with Ms Anderson - is to hear the charges formally on Thursday and a translator has been called in for the hearing.
His family is expected to attend.
Ms Anderson, 41, originally from Blackpool, was a keen video blogger, as was Mr Glass.
She had a YouTube channel called Sophie's Joy Breastfeeding Mama, on which she uploaded videos about nursing her son until the age of eight.
After her death Mr Glass paid tribute to her in a video he uploaded on YouTube.
He said he "missed her so much" and added: "Somebody wake me up from this nightmare... she is meant to be having my baby in three months."
On Tuesday he posted another video titled 'When will I come back to Youtube', in which he stated he would not be posting any more videos for "a while" and did not know when he would return online.
He said: "It's not the right time at the moment, I need to get my life in order and get through this death."
A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are in contact with the Thai police and are providing consular support to a British man following a road traffic accident in Bangkok."
