Plymouth Argyle 2-1 Crewe Alexandra

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Nate Blissett's brilliant header helped Plymouth fight back to beat Crewe at Home Park and take top spot in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Crewe dominated the first half after taking an early lead against their already-promoted hosts.
James Jones volleyed the Alex in front from 20 yards when Argyle failed to clear George Cooper's corner.
Luke McCormick then made a brilliant save to deny Cooper as the visitors pressed.
Crewe goalkeeper Ben Garratt made a superb save to deny Blissett, and force a corner, but from the set-piece Argyle levelled when target man Ryan Taylor spun to redirect David Fox's shot into the far corner.
Blissett, who came on as a second-half replacement for Jake Jervis, powered home a header from Graham Carey's cross from the left to cap an incredible five-minute turnaround.
