[SN]TITLE[SN]
Living with Cancer: A Newsround special

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
CBBC actress Dominique Moore takes a personal look at how cancer affects the lives of children and young people.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Last year Dominique was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma during the filming of Hotel Trubble and, after nine months of chemotherapy, she has been told she is free of the disease.
One in three people will develop cancer at some stage in their lifetime and around 1,700 children are diagnosed each year in the UK. Many more will be affected by a parent or relative living with the disease.
What does it feel like to be treated for cancer? How does it feel to lose a parent? Is being given the all-clear the end, or the beginning, of the story? This documentary hears from children who can answer those questions.
