Wenders' poignant images of desolate landscapes explore themes of movement and travel, alongside those of memory, time, loss and nostalgia.
Wenders said: "I see myself as an interpreter, as a translator, a guardian, if you want, of stories that places tell me.
"I became who I was on the road. I became a filmmaker, when I found out that road movies were my genre. I felt like a fish in the water when I discovered that there was a kind of film that you could actually make as you were travelling."
"And as a photographer, it is even more obvious that my principal vocation was to discover places where I had not been before.
"As I can't transport people to those places in the world that I found and liked, photography gives me a chance to take the places to them."
The prints in the exhibition are large, often 3-4m (9-13ft) in size.
Wenders said: "I want people to become immersed in my places, stand there with me and be as impressed as I was initially."
This latest panorama, at 4.5m in width, depicts the epic landscape of the American West - an area that Wenders has extensively and famously examined through both film and photography.
"I think I had wide-open eyes for America, and 'the American landscape' in a general sense seemed extremely attractive to me, both as a photographer and filmmaker," he said.
This image is from Montreal and was taken during the shoot of Wenders' feature film starring James Franco and Charlotte Gainsbourg, Every Thing Will Be Fine (released in 2015).
This picture shows Potsdamer Platz in Berlin after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 but before regeneration. After the construction of the Berlin Wall, Weinhaus Huth, the large house in the photograph, stood alone on West Berlin territory in the immediate vicinity of the wall.
Wenders said: "Maybe the long absence from Germany of 15 years has enabled me to see places here with the same wide-open eyes, in those landscapes, German or American, I'm still looking for the traces of civilization, of history, or people."
Time Capsules. By the side of the road. Wim Wenders' recent photographs is at Blain|Southern Berlin until 14 November 2015.
