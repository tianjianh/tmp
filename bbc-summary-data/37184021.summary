The 19-year-old England youth international made five first-team starts for the French club since 2015.
He has played with Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham, who is currently on loan at City, with England's Under-19 side.
"There aren't many young, English centre-halves as good as he is," head coach Lee Johnson told City's website.
Chief operating officer Mark Ashton added: "We still feel we have work to do in this window and everyone at the club is working hard behind the scenes to get business done."
