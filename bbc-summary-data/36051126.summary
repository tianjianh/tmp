Lawro's Premier League predictions: Midweek matches

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lawro's opponents for this week's five rearranged Premier League fixtures are world champion boxer Carl Frampton and Nobby Butcher, aka comedian Sacha Baron Cohen.
The pair made predictions for Premier League games that were postponed because of FA Cup ties or the Capital One Cup final.
They can boost their scores and standings on the guest leaderboard, with Frampton needing 40 points from his three matches to move top of the table.
A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.
Before Monday's game between Stoke and Tottenham, Lawro has got three correct results and no perfect scores from this weekend's matches, to give him a total so far of 30 points.
He trails actors Idris Elba and Richard Madden, who have got five results correct so far, with no perfect scores, and currently have 50 points.

This table will be updated after Stoke v Tottenham
All kick-offs 19:45 BST unless otherwise stated
Lawro's prediction: 0-2
Nobby's prediction: 0-2
Match report
I was very impressed by West Ham when I watched them draw against Leicester at the King Power Stadium on Sunday.
The Hammers really should have won the game - if you are going to award penalties like the one Leicester got in the last minute, then there are going to be 10 a game.

West Ham don't stop coming at you, they are very physical and strong, and they have got different ways of scoring.
Watford ended their six-game winless run in the league by beating West Brom on Saturday, although they were a little bit fortunate with the Baggies missing two penalties.
With the Hornets playing Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend, their manager Quique Sanchez Flores is going to change his team around. Because of that, I am backing West Ham.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Frampton's prediction: 2-0
Match preview
After that memorable comeback win over Borussia Dortmund in the Europa League, Liverpool made a load of changes for Sunday's win over Bournemouth and still looked pretty comfortable.
I am backing them to win on Wednesday too.

The whole situation at Everton is very strange and it feels like they have lost their way a little bit. I don't understand how they have got themselves in such a mess with the players they have got.
I also don't know why Toffees manager Roberto Martinez did not field a stronger side for Saturday's draw with Southampton.
It was a home game where he knows some of the punters are against him because of his poor record there this season, and one he badly needed to win.
If he had left a few out for this game, people would understand it was because Everton have got a massive FA Cup semi-final coming up against Manchester United on Saturday.
That game could be pivotal for Martinez and you know what will happen now, don't you? One of his key players will play in this game and pick up an injury that means they will miss out on Wembley.
Lawro's prediction: 2-1
Nobby's prediction: 2-1
Match preview
Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has already come out and said he will change his team around before Sunday's FA Cup semi-final against Watford.
That helps Manchester United, who have their own semi-final to look forward to, but nothing is straightforward for Louis van Gaal's side at the moment.
Yes they beat Aston Villa at the weekend, but again United struggled to create good chances and they are finding it hard to kill games off.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Frampton's prediction: 2-2
Match preview
Arsenal are another team struggling to score a second goal to finish teams off at the moment - we saw that again in their draw with Crystal Palace on Sunday.
West Brom were unfortunate to lose at home to Watford at the weekend - but when they are on the road they struggle to cause much of a goal threat.
Lawro's prediction: 2-0
Frampton's prediction: 3-0
Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
*Does not include score for postponed games
Lawro's best score: 160 points (week 19 v Guy Mowbray)
Lawro's worst score: 20 points (week one v Graeme Swann & week 23 v Ice Cube and Kevin Hart)
