Asad Khan death: Choking game rife at hanged boy's school

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of an 11-year-old boy found hanged has been adjourned after it emerged a "choking game" was "all over the school".

Asad Khan, from Bradford, who died in September was a pupil at the city's Beckfoot Upper Heaton School. His family believe he had been bullied.
An inquest into his death was adjourned on Monday when the claims emerged.
The family's solicitor Ruth Bundey said it was important to have time to review the evidence.
Speaking after the adjournment at Bradford Coroner's Court, she added: "We have always considered the death of an 11-year-old boy by self-suspension, a boy who had no mental health background, as being completely inexplicable.
"We now find out, only this morning, that a police sergeant involved in the investigation spoke to a school manager in January."
Ms Bundey said the new evidence could explain why many of those questioned "were very reluctant to come anywhere near the inquest".
The solicitor also said the evidence raised concerns about "the school's duty of care if such a dangerous practice was known to the kids".
She added it was important that the evidence be reviewed in order to help prevent future deaths.
A statement from the school said: "We are very sorry that the inquest has been adjourned. No words can adequately describe the sense of loss that we know Asad's family feel and any delay in the inquest process is regrettable.
"The school has made a series of statements to police in relation to their investigation and we believe they will be thoroughly examined when the inquest resumes. Further comment at this stage would be inappropriate."
West Yorkshire Police said it had provided all available evidence for the purpose of the inquest.
"This is a tragic case involving a young child and we will continue to do everything to support the coroner in this matter. As this is an ongoing coronial case it would be inappropriate to comment any further," the force said.
Asad was found unresponsive at his home on Tile Street, off Whetley Lane, on 28 September by his mother Farheen Khan.
He was taken to hospital but died a short time later.
After his death, his mother called for "justice for her child" amid claims he had been bullied.
The two-day inquest was expected to consider whether or not the pupil at Beckfoot Upper Heaton School, Bradford, had been bullied.
The hearing was adjourned until 3 July.
