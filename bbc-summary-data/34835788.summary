The former Hulme Library building and the former Beech Mount Children's Home in Harpurhey are the first to be opened up from next month.
Homeless organisations will be able to refer people to the temporary accommodation.
The council is also assessing other empty buildings across the city.
It is part of an ongoing campaign to improve services for homeless people and increase the amount of bed spaces over the winter, the council said.
It said the move would result in an extra 165 bed spaces.
Last month two former Manchester United players allowed a group of about 30 homeless people to stay in the former Stock Exchange building.
Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs are renovating the building into a luxury hotel.
Three buildings in other areas of Manchester, which had previously operated as shared houses, will also provide temporary accommodation, the council confirmed.
The council's rough sleepers team will provide support and help occupants access medical, mental health and drug and alcohol services
Councillor Paul Andrews, executive member for adult health and well being, said the announcement came after months of planning.
He added: "While providing shelter and a roof over their heads is obviously a good start, what's really important is working with charities, faith groups and our own homelessness services to make sure the right help and support is available to rough sleepers so we can help them make the first steps towards getting off the streets for good."
