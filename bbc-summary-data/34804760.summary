Police say Darius McCollum, 50, stole the coach from the nation's busiest bus terminal, New York Port Authority, on Wednesday.
He was found with the vehicle two hours after it was scheduled to leave.
Among his previous crimes was the theft of a bus full of passengers at Penn Station, driving it to Kennedy airport.
He grew up in Queens and spent a lot of time at the terminus of the F train, where his fascination with the trains brought him to the attention of workers there who took him under their wing.
By the age of eight, he could reportedly recall the names of every station on the New York subway system.
His train and bus troubles began in 1981, when the then-teenager took control of an underground train and drove it for six stops.
Over the years, he has also been arrested for trespassing at a subway control tower, attempting to commandeer a suburban train and stealing a coach bus, according to local media.
In 2008, Mr McCollum told the Associated Press news agency he planned to get in touch with a charity to help him find a therapist.
Five years later, he said: "It was a rough process but I finally made it.
"I can't afford to get arrested again, I can't deal with the jail thing - it's too much, the gang mentality."
