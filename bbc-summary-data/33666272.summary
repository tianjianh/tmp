Many others are thought to have been injured in the blast near a popular bar late on Saturday.
It comes three days after a double suicide blast in Maroua that killed at least 13 people.
Officials suspect that the militant Nigerian Islamist group Boko Haram is behind the attacks.
Military sources said the latest attack took place in the Pont Vert district of Maroua.
The Cameroonian army uses the town of Maroua as the headquarters for its operations against the group, as part of a multinational force battling the militants in neighbouring parts of Nigeria.
