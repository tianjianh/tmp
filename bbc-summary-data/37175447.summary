Among the other eight nominees for best comedy show are Nish Kumar and Keiran Hodgson, who were both shortlisted last year.

The winner of that category will take home Â£5,000.

Nica Burns, director of the lastminute.com Edinburgh Comedy Awards said the two shortlists reflect the "breadth and quality" of comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe.
She said judges made more than 1,400 visits to shows during the festival in a bid to find the very best during a "brilliant year of comedy".
She added: "Four outstanding stand-ups, a female comic performing in character as Dave, a novel-writing puppet, a wonderful storyteller and a comic who is as moving as he is funny.
"An international list with four UK artists, three Australians and a Dubliner.
"The six nominees for the newcomer award are equally international with an Australian and an American, and the vibrancy of the Scottish stand-up scene is reflected in the nomination of Glaswegian Scott Gibson and the best show nominee, Richard Gadd."
Previous winners of the best show award include Al Murray - The Pub Landlord, Russell Kane and Rich Hall. Last year, Sam Simmons scooped the award for his show, Spaghetti for Breakfast.
And Roisin Conarty, Sarah Millican and Josie Long are among those who won the best newcomer award early in their stand-up careers.
