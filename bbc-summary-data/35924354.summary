David Wilson, 49, was found dead at his flat in Southwick Road on 14 December 2014. He had been stabbed.
Northumbria Police said a lost man called from the Southwick area on Mr Wilson's phone needing to know how to get back to Gateshead.
Officers said it was a "vital piece of the jigsaw" to find those responsible.
Police said the man made the call at 04:41 and said his lift had been unable to collect him as had been arranged.
The caller the mentioned he was walking towards the Halfway House pub in Southwick from the Stadium of Light, police said.
Det Ch Insp Mark Ord said: "This has been a very complex and difficult investigation.
"I remain open-minded as to how this man came into possession of David's phone, witnesses who were in David's home at midnight tell us that David was in possession of his phone at this time, but by 4.41am that morning his phone was used to make this call.
"I urge this man to come forward to police and tell us how he came in possession of David's phone.
"We will not stop looking for this man, we will find you."
The person who was expected to pick the caller up is also urged to contact police.
Officers still believe Mr Wilson's death could be linked with a robbery in which a man was mugged near the Post Office cash machine in Southwick Green earlier that morning.
A 34-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder remains on bail.
