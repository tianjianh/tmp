[SN]TITLE[SN]
Motorway sound reduction work brought forward by a year

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A resurfacing plan to reduce sound pollution on a stretch of the M5 will start a year ahead of schedule.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The government had agreed to resurface between junctions 11a and 12 in Gloucestershire, after noise complaints from people living close by.
However, following a campaign by local MPs, residents and councillors the work will now start in March 2017.
Residents living near the motorway had previously complained of "horrendous" traffic noise after trees were felled.
Richard Graham, MP for Gloucester, said with more housing planned in the area he was pleased that the government had "taken seriously the quality of life for residents".
