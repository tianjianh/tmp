Morgan Ferrier: Dagenham & Redbridge sign Boreham Wood forward

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Dagenham & Redbridge have signed forward Morgan Ferrier on a two-year deal from National League rivals Boreham Wood.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ex-Arsenal trainee Ferrier rejected a new contract with the Wood, meaning his transfer fee will be set by a tribunal.
The 22-year-old was Boreham Wood's leading goalscorer last season, with 11 goals in 30 National League games.
Ferrier is the second Wood player to join Dagenham this summer, following the arrival of defender Ben Nunn.
