Donoghue has written the script for the stage version, which will premiere at the Theatre Royal Stratford East next May.
The story of Room is told through the eyes of a five-year-old boy who is being held captive with his mother.
A film adaption was released earlier this year and earned Brie Larson an Oscar for best actress.
The stage production will be directed by Cora Bissett and feature songs by Bissett and Kathryn Joseph.
The novel was released in 2010 and was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and the Orange Prize for Fiction - now known as the Bailey's Women's Prize.
