A pub chain has apologised after a woman who suffered brain injuries in a hit-and-run was refused service when staff mistakenly thought she was drunk.

Danielle Stoton, 19, went to The Gatehouse, Doncaster, with her mother Michelle on Saturday to meet a friend.
But Miss Stoton was refused service at the bar, despite showing a card explaining her medical condition.
Pub owner J D Wetherspoon said: "This was an error and one which we wholeheartedly apologise for."

Miss Stoton suffered brain injuries, leaving her with slurred speech, in a hit-and-run in Armthorpe, Doncaster, in August 2014.
Her mother said it had been a "huge step" in Danielle's rehabilitation to go into a pub and order drinks and she had been apprehensive before the visit.
She admitted Danielle had sworn at bar staff after being refused service, but was still asked to leave after showing the pub's manager a card detailing the effects of her injuries.
"The front lobe damage to Danielle does cause short temper", she said, but added the experience had "been a real setback", for her daughter.
Mrs Stoton said the effects of her daughter's injuries were still "really raw after bringing Danielle up for 18 years to be independent".
Wetherspoon's spokesman Eddie Gershon said Miss Stoton should have been served by a staff member at the pub on Priory Walk.
"We will be retraining our staff in relation to this incident and will carry out a full investigation", he added.
The driver who hit Danielle was sentenced to eight months in prison and a two-year driving ban after pleading guilty in May.
