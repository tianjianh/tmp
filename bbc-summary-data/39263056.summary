The first half was goalless and it took until the 94th minute for Wrexham to break the deadlock.
However, Paul Rutherford's goal was soon cancelled out by Diarra.
Barrow remained eighth, but four points off the play-offs with a game in hand while Wrexham stayed 10th in the National League table.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "Overall on the game the draw is probably a fair result, but the way they scored their goal was disappointing.
"But I'm proud of the lads - absolutely outstanding.
"It's not an easy place to come to. It's very difficult  - they're very direct, there's a lot of pressure and they're all big lads."
