Chasing 60 to claim their first win of the tournament, Ireland mustered only 47-7 in Dharamsala.
Paul van Meekeren twice claimed two wickets in two balls in figures of 4-11, and Roelof van der Merwe took 2-3.
Stephan Myburgh hit 27 off 18 balls and George Dockrell took 3-7 in the Netherlands' 59-5 after rain delayed play by two hours and 40 minutes.
Ireland, who lost to Oman in their opening game before an abandoned match against Bangladesh ended their hopes of qualification, finish bottom of Group A.
Bangladesh and Oman meet at 14:00 GMT in the final game of the first group stage, with the winners going through to the Super 10s, which start on Tuesday.
As well as seamer Van Meekeren bowled on a slow surface, the moment of the match belonged to Pieter Seelaar.
His catch to dismiss Kevin O'Brien for a second-ball duck - running to his left at deep mid-wicket before diving full length to hold on to a flat pull just above the ground - rivalled Sikandar Raza's leaping effort for Zimbabwe against Scotland.
It also sparked an Ireland collapse of six wickets for 16 runs, with Van Meekeren removing any doubt over the outcome by dismissing Max Sorensen and Dockrell in the final over.
"The catch swung the game in our favour," said Netherlands captain Peter Borren.
Ireland captain William Porterfield said: "We didn't see it home. We didn't play smart cricket.
"We haven't been good enough when we've been on the pitch. We haven't been up to scratch."
