An independent panel has been set up to consider applications to a community projects fund linked to a massive offshore wind farm project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Work has begun on constructing the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited (Bowl) in the Outer Moray Firth at a cost of £2.6bn.
More than 80 turbines have been proposed for the scheme.
The new £3m fund is open to community groups, charities and non-profit-making organisations.
It will operate over five years with £2m available for projects in Caithness and Sutherland and £1m for applications from Moray.
Energy giant SSE, one of the companies involved in Bowl, has announced the establishment of the fund's panel.
Its members are Caithness and North Sutherland Fund co-ordinator David Shearer, Highlands and Islands regional director at Scottish Council for Development and Industry Fraser Grieve and chief executive of Moray Chamber of Commerce Sarah Medcraf.
Also Prof James Hunter, who is Emeritus professor of history at the University of the Highlands and Islands, and SSE's head of community investment Morven Smith.
