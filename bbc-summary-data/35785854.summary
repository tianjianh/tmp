Why would anyone take the Newcastle job?

The club has problems from top to bottom, according to Magpies legend Alan Shearer.

They are stuck in the relegation zone - only Aston Villa have a worse record this season. And while they are just a point behind 17th-place Sunderland, there's a further eight-point gap to the next team, Swansea.
Oh, and there's only 10 games left. And the next one is away to table-topping workaholics Leicester.
But come on, it's #feelgoodfriday. So with that in mind, and with Rafael Benitez in place as their new manager, we've been thinking about the things Newcastle have going for them.
One point. And they play their north-east rivals at home next week. What an opportunity!
Georginio Wijnaldum captained PSV to their first title in years in the Netherlands last season. He's Newcastle's top scorer this season  - nine goals in 22 appearances from midfield is decent. He scored against Brazil for the Dutch in the 2014 World Cup third place play-off. Now if Rafa can just get him firing consistently...
Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend didn't come cheap when they arrived on Tyneside in January and have been two of the better players recently. Now if Rafa can just get them firing consistently...
Many Newcastle fans have been critical of the board. OK, very critical of the board. But they have spent Â£83m since the end of last season and have pledged to continue forking out on players.
The Spaniard has the seventh-best win rate in Premier League history, according to Opta.
The last time Benitez managed a team that plays in stripes (Inter Milan) he won the Fifa Club World Cup - though he was sacked five days later.
Remember the 2005 Champions League final? A bold team selection saw Liverpool 3-0 down to AC Milan at half-time in Istanbul. What happened next? A bold fightback by Benitez's men is what happened, and Europe's premier trophy returned to Anfield for a fifth time.
Can he pull off another miracle on Tyneside?
