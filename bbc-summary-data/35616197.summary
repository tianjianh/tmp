[SN]TITLE[SN]
Holocaust Memorial Day to be recognised in Guernsey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
States members have agreed Holocaust Memorial Day should be officially recognised in Guernsey.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The day is marked by many countries on 27 January, and members have agreed it will be commemorated each year on that date.
Deputies voted late on Friday and the Billet said it was "important" to "keep the memory of the Holocaust alive in our community".
Three Jewish residents living in the Bailiwick died in Auschwitz.
Deputy Elis Bebb said the day should be given a higher profile locally, but that it should be kept separate from Liberation Day.
He also said it was important that the island became fully involved in the international event of remembrance.
Of the six Jewish residents in the Bailiwick of Guernsey during the occupation, three of them - Marianne Grunfeld, Auguste Spitz and Therese Steiner - died in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.
The Billet said the Holocaust "scarred Guernsey in different ways", including the deaths of the Guernsey Eight and the numerous prisoners of war who were set to work and died while building the Atlantic Wall.
In January, more than 200 Holocaust survivors attended a unique commemoration in London to mark the day.
