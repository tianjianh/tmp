[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Goals from Shaun Harrad and a brace from Gerry McDonagh proved enough for the home side.
Darren Carter had pulled one back for the visitors on 68 minutes, but despite pressure Rovers could not find another.
Early on Carter had seen his penalty saved by impressive Wrexham goalkeeper Luke Coddington.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "It's been long overdue. They were outstanding first-half, magnificent. In the second-half we were put under a lot of pressure, but they were brave.
"They did everything we asked of them and I am very proud of the lads."
