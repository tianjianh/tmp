A group of at least four whales were seen north of Hunstanton during the afternoon, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) said.
An RNLI spokeswoman said its hovercraft had taken marine life experts to assess the whale which was still stuck in water with a depth of about 6ft (2m).
She said: "It looks quite injured and is in difficulty."
Gary Pearson, who lives in Dersingham, saw the whales at about 16:00 GMT and said he was told they had been there for a couple of hours.
"Two had already got out to deeper water, but two were still in trouble and one got away when I was there," he said.
"The remaining one was thrashing around and in distress. It looks like an adult sperm whale to me and I wouldn't be surprised if it was 40ft [12m] long.
"It's probably stuck between these boulders covered in algae which you can see exposed at low tide."
