[SN]TITLE[SN]
Denbighshire council to stop the right to buy council homes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A third north Wales council has voted to stop people buying their own council houses after losing more than 4,000 homes to the policy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Denbighshire council said there were 10 applicants for every vacant council home in the county and right to buy "threatened investment in new homes".
The authority follows Anglesey, Flintshire, Carmarthenshire and Swansea councils.
Last year, eight council homes in the county were sold under right to buy.
Barbara Smith, Denbighshire's cabinet member for housing, said: "There clearly is a case in the county for this to happen."
The authority will now apply to the Welsh Government for approval to stop right to buy for the next five years.
