Jonathan Alan Smith, known as Johnny, was discovered by police at a flat on Middleton Road at about 16:10 BST on Wednesday following concerns about his welfare.
A post-mortem examination revealed the 44-year-old died from a single stab wound to the chest.
Police said they are unsure at this stage if anyone else was involved.
Det Insp Lewis Hughes, of Greater Manchester Police, said: "We were initially called by a concerned neighbour who said they had not seen Johnny for a few days and were worried.
"At this moment in time, we do not know what has happened to him or whether a third party was involved in his death."
"Johnny was last seen in Chadderton town centre on 11 May and I would ask anyone who may have been in contact with him either that day or up until his death, to contact us."
