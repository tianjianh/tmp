Alex Peguero-Sosa, 17, was injured in Kingsbridge at about 02:20 BST and was later declared dead at Derriford Hospital, in Plymouth.
A man in his 40s was arrested in Kingsbridge on Sunday on suspicion of murdering the teenager. He is in custody at Torquay police station.
Police said members of the public had attempted to revive the boy.
A spokesman for Plymouth Argyle said Mr Peguero-Sosa was released from the club last summer.
The town's mayor, Wayne Grills, said Kingsbridge was a very small community and the teenager was well known and liked.
He said: "The town is in a state of shock. Waking up to the news on social media, it is very unusual. It has been decades since the last event of this kind. It is a close knit community and this is very unusual."
