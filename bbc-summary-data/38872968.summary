Two people were found dead at an address on Midland Street on Saturday night, with early indications suggesting they had taken heroin.
Police said there had been a number of deaths in the area linked to drugs over the past couple of weeks, with users urged to be "cautious and vigilant".
Tests are due to take place to confirm the causes of death in each case.
Det Ch Insp Paul Kirby, of Humberside Police, said: "It is not clear whether all these tragic events are directly related, however we can't rule out the possibility.
"To prevent other deaths I would urge drug users to be especially cautious and vigilant. If they experience any unusual symptoms after taking drugs, they should seek medical attention immediately."
