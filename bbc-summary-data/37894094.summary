Bristol have sacked director of rugby Andy Robinson after the board "lost confidence" that he would be able to retain the club's Premiership position.

The former England and Scotland head coach, 52, led the club to promotion in May but was suspended last week pending a "review of their coaching needs".
Bristol have lost all 10 games in all competitions this season and are bottom of the Premiership.
"I was surprised and disappointed by the board's decision," said Robinson.
"I am extremely proud to have played my part in helping Bristol Rugby reach their goal of getting back to the Aviva Premiership after a long seven-year absence."
Robinson, who only signed a new three-year contract in August, was appointed as director of rugby in March 2013 and took over all team affairs a week later after head coach Liam Middleton was sacked.
"The board lost confidence that Andy would retain the club's Premiership position, bearing in mind the results to date," said chairman Chris Booy.
"Andy departs with the knowledge that he made a significant contribution in helping Bristol return to the Premiership this season."
Former South Africa and Leicester boss Heyneke Meyer is a leading contender to replace Robinson, but no deal has been finalised at this stage.
Bristol beat Doncaster in the Championship play-off final in May to return to the top flight after seven seasons in the second tier.
They topped the Championship's regular season table on five occasions, but lost four times in the play-offs, including three play-off finals against Exeter in 2010, London Welsh in 2014 and Worcester in 2015.
