[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jose Reyes has become the first player to be suspended under new Major League Baseball rules brought in to address domestic violence issues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Colorado Rockies shortstop, a four-time All-Star player who earns $22m (Â£15.7m) a year, has been placed on paid leave while he faces criminal proceedings.
Reyes, 32, who was arrested at a Hawaii resort in October following an argument with his wife, has pleaded not guilty to an abuse charge.
His trial is due to start on 4 April.
The date coincides with the start of the new MLB season, when the Rockies play at Arizona.
The new policy was agreed in August following a number of high-profile domestic violence cases in a number of US sports, including baseball, American football and basketball.
