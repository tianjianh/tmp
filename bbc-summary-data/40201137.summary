[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Andrew Gray said no-one had ever reported a fault with the modesty wall in the gym at Edinburgh's Liberton High School to him.
Keane Wallis-Bennett died after the wall fell on her in 2014.
Mr Gray, 55, was giving evidence at the fatal accident inquiry for Keane, who was 12 when she died.
A former janitor and a cleaner also gave evidence on the fourth day of the inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Angela Young had cleaned the girls changing rooms on the morning the wall collapsed on the 1 April 2014.
She said she was not aware of anything untoward with it. Ms Young agreed she had a reputation for reporting problems, but had never had any reason to report a concern about the gym wall.
Retired janitor Walter Thompson also told the inquiry he had not been aware of any issues with the wall that killed Keane.
The inquiry at Edinburgh Sheriff Court continues.
