Merseyside Police were called after the Mercedes Sprinter was taken from outside Liverpool Philharmonic Hall on 26 October.
Officers said a vehicle discovered in the Tuebrook area three days later has since been identified as the tour bus.
The comic has tweeted his thanks to the police and the "good people of Liverpool" for their help.
Mr Bailey's manager said the van had been given false number plates and had suffered "minor" crash damage.
A laptop, several bags and suitcases belonging to the crew remain missing, he added.
Merseyside Police said they were continuing to search for a man pictured in CCTV images released after the theft.
