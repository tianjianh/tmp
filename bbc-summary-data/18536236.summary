Controversial plans to build a 103-turbine wind farm in the centre of Shetland could face a legal challenge.

Sustainable Shetland, a group opposed to the development, has announced it intends to seek a judicial review of the Scottish government's decision to approve the development.
The wind farm would be the third biggest in Scotland, run by community company Viking Energy.
Energy Minister Fergus Ewing granted consent for the scheme in April.
Protesters claim the development is too big and would blight the landscape.
Supporters argue it would raise money for the islands, create jobs and help meet renewable energy targets.
The 370MW wind farm is aimed at powering more than 175,000 homes despite Shetland having a population of about 22,000.
It is estimated the wind farm could bring about Â£30m annual income for the local community.
