Lawyers for victims campaigner Raymond McCord and a group of NI anti-Brexit politicians are expected to put their arguments to the Supreme Court later.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They say people in Northern Ireland should have to give consent before the government triggers Article 50, starting the process of leaving the EU.
Their case was rejected by a Belfast High Court judge in October.
However, they won the right to be considered as part of this week's wider Supreme Court hearing.
Although the UK voted overall to leave the EU, a 56% majority in Northern Ireland voted to remain.
On Tuesday, the court was told the EU referendum result does not give ministers the power to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.
The lawyer acting against the government said the "political significance" of June's vote was "irrelevant" to the legal battle.
The government says a Parliamentary vote is not necessary before invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.
It is appealing against the High Court ruling it lost last month.
Although the result could complicate the government's triggering of the process for the UK leaving the EU it is not expected to stop Brexit happening.
