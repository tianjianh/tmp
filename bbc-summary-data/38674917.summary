Edinburgh routes to and from Milngavie and Helensburgh have been disrupted due to fire damage on the railway near Blackridge station.
Some trains have been cancelled and other services are starting or terminating in Airdrie or Bathgate.
Services between Motherwell and Dalmuir were cancelled due to electrical issues, but resumed at about 11:00.
There were also delays between Oban and Glasgow after a car struck a bridge on part of the line.
ScotRail said it now had buses operating between Dalmally an Oban. Disruption is expected until 17:00.
Information about replacement services for all the affected train routes are available on the ScotRail website.
ScotRail said the damage near Blackridge station was caused by a fire which appeared to have been started deliberately at about 22:00 on Wednesday.
Detectives from British Transport Police said they were investigating the fire-raising incident, which had caused damage to the track and overhead power lines.
DC Niall McGugan said: "Although this fire was contained very quickly, the damage was extensive and the repair cost will be significant.
"Whilst we are still working to determine exactly what happened, at this time we are working to the presumption that this fire was started deliberately.
"I am very keen to speak with anyone who may have been in the area at this time or saw anyone acting suspiciously.
"Please get in touch as your information may help us investigate."
