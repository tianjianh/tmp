Jordan Spieth will be "scarred" by his capitulation at the Masters on Sunday, says three-time winner Sir Nick Faldo.

Defending champion Spieth, 22, had a quadruple-bogey seven on the par-three 12th as Danny Willett became the first Englishman since Faldo in 1996 to win.
The American had become the first man to lead the Masters for seven straight rounds going into the final day.
"This will scar him. This will damage him for a while," said Faldo, who also won three Open Championships.
"We're all in shock with what happened to Jordan," added Faldo, who won his third and final Green Jacket in similar circumstances to Willett when Greg Norman blew a six-shot lead in 1996.
"In '96 you got the sense that Greg was struggling, but it was bit by bit. What happened to Jordan was so sudden, just bam. It was 10 minutes of golf. That's the harshness of it."
Spieth, who had carded four successive birdies to open a five-shot lead with nine holes to play, has said he hopes he "never again experiences" a similar collapse of form.
