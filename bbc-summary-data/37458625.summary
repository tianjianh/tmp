Bristol City 2-1 Nottingham Forest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jamie Paterson's strike helped Bristol City earn a narrow victory over his former club Nottingham Forest.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It was the 24-year-old's first goal for the Robins since he left Forest to join them on a three-year deal in August.
Apostolos Vellios gave the visitors an early lead at Ashton Gate as he found the back of the net via the post.
However, a poor backpass from Danny Fox allowed Tammy Abraham to equalise for Bristol City before Paterson's toe poke gave his side all three points.
Forest, looking for their first league win in six, enjoyed a lot of success down the left and Ben Osborn drove past the Robins defence before passing to Henri Lansbury, who played the ball across the goal to Vellios for his fourth goal of the season.
The home side pressed for an equaliser after the break and Abraham netted his 11th goal of the season when he pounced on Fox's mistake and rounded goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic before slotting in from a tight angle.
Three minutes later, City turned the game on its head as a long free-kick was headed down in the box by Abraham allowing Paterson the simplest of goals.
Victory maintained Bristol City's place in the Championship's top six as Forest dropped to 18th, four points above the drop zone.
Bristol City manager Lee Johnson:
"The attitude of the players at the end of a really tough run of games was little short of miraculous.
"I had to change things at half-time. It was no reflection on the players taken off, but we had to get more attacking options on the field.
"We had a bit of luck with the back-pass for Tammy's goal, but our pressing was good throughout and Tammy still had to finish it.
"The second goal demoralised Forest and sometimes things are written in the stars, like Jamie Paterson scoring against his old club."
Nottingham Forest head coach Philippe Montanier:
"We had good control of the game except for a spell of about eight minutes that cost us the result.
"I thought we played well in the first half and deserved to lead 1-0. We knew Bristol City would push onto our back four in the second half, but we were strong and just lost the game in that vital eight minutes.
"Bristol played well, but I thought we deserved something and it is tough on my players to lose after that performance.
"What we are doing at the moment is not sufficient. We need to be more efficient and take care of the details which make the difference in a close match."
