[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Carwyn Jones says Labour is undergoing a "great deal of division that will take some time to repair".

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh Labour leader has been speaking in Chicago on his US business tour.
He said it was crucial for the party to "get its act together" once the contest between Owen Smith and Jeremy Corbyn was over.
Mr Jones said UK Labour was currently failing to provide "effective opposition" to the UK government.
He said he did not want to see "weeks and months of animosity" when the new UK Labour leader is announced later this month.
The Pontypridd MP and Labour leadership contender, Owen Smith, said if he wins he would campaign for a new referendum on EU membership, while his opponent Jeremy Corbyn is against this.
Carwyn Jones told the audience in Chicago he also opposed a new EU referendum.
Another vote, he said, would been seen as "an attempt by the establishment to overturn democracy".
Mr Jones has previously said he will not publicly back either of the leadership candidates.
