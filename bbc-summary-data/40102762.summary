Actress Priyanka Chopra's decision to wear a dress that showed her legs for a meeting with Indian PM Narendra Modi has been criticised by some social media users in India.

Some Facebook users told her off for "disrespecting" the PM".
The unapologetic actress responded by posting a picture of both her mother and her wearing short dresses, captioned "legs for the day".
Other Indian actresses have also faced anger over their choice of attire.
Deepika Padukone once publicly called out a leading Indian newspaper in 2014 for tweeting a picture of her cleavage.
"YES! I am a Woman. I have breasts AND a cleavage! You got a problem!!??" Padukone tweeted to the paper. Many other actresses also came out in support of her.
The controversy began after Chopra, who stars in the new Baywatch film and in the US television series Quantico, posted a picture with Mr Modi, thanking him "for taking the time from his packed schedule" to meet her in Berlin.
It didn't take long though, before the "disrespectful" dress became the topic of conversation, with many commenting on how it "insulted" Mr Modi and his "pious followers."
Chopra chose not to directly respond to people, but instead made what many are calling a "classy comeback" on Instagram, featuring herself, her mother, and of course, legs.
The post had received more than 100,000 "likes" in a little over four hours.
And while Chopra chose not to directly engage with those criticising her, many of her fans took on her trolls in her defence:
