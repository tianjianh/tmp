The 13th annual Christmas Day Dip at Felixstowe in Suffolk saw people charge into the water at about 10:00 GMT.
Many wore festive-themed fancy dress in the event, which raises money for the St Elizabeth Hospice.
Those taking part in the swim, off Sea Road in the town, were cheered on by a small crowd of onlookers.
