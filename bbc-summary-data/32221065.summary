The waterfall used by Batman star Christian Bale to conceal the superhero's secret cave on screen can now be reached via a woodland trail.

Henrhyd Falls in the Brecon Beacons National Park was used as the cover for the Batcave in the film The Dark Knight Rises.
Fans previously had to clamber down a steep tree-lined hill and wade across a river to reach the falls.
Park chiefs have now built a path to the waterfall for easier access.
The 88ft (27m) wall of water was seen in the final film of the Christopher Nolan trilogy as the location where Robin discovers the Batcave after the apparent death of Batman.
The new trail and footbridge bring visitors out at the foot of the falls, and they can then walk behind the water and into the entrance of the Batcave.
Henrhyd Falls is the tallest waterfall in south Wales and is a site of special scientific interest due to the rare mosses, liverworts and lichen which grow in the damp, heavily wooded gorge, with its thin soils and steep rocky slopes.
Batman fan Jackie Davies, 24, from Bridgend, said: "I love Christian Bale in the Batman films and coming here you can feel like you're a part of that world.
"The waterfall is spectacular and I had to come with my costume for a picture. My boyfriend finds it embarrassing but I love it."
Judith Harvey, wardens manager for Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, said the falls were a popular walking destination in the Brecon Beacons.
"With work now complete, it means that people for many generations to come can really enjoy what Abercraf and the surrounding area has to offer, safe in the knowledge that they are not causing any damage."
