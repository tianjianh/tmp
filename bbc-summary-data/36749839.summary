The 67-year-old was taken to hospital last month in an "extremely serious life-threatening" condition following a heart attack at a concert in Turkey.
Manager Simon Porter said Parfitt was making a "steady" recovery but that it would be "a long and ongoing process".
"To this end, Rick has given his full blessing for the band to continue with the current summer touring schedule utilising guest guitarists."
Porter stressed Parfitt's "excellent" recovery, but said the guitarist would not be returning to the band until he was back to full health.
The band said they wanted to "thank the fans for their continued understanding and support and would like to stress that he will return to the fold as soon as possible".
Parfitt's family added: "We would like to thank everyone, including the fans for their messages of support during the last weeks, and especially the kindness and care of all the staff at the Royal Brompton."
The guitarist has had a number of health scares in recent years - including a throat cancer scare in 2005 and a heart attack in 2011.
Status Quo cancelled a series of gigs in 2014 after Parfitt was told to rest by doctors, following surgery to correct a problem with his previous quadruple heart bypass, which he underwent in 1997.
Freddie Edwards, son of bass player John "Rhino" Edwards will take Parfitt's place at most of the forthcoming shows in July and August.
Irish guitarist Richie Malone will step in for gigs in Leuven, Belgium and Edinburgh on 20 and 23 July respectively.
