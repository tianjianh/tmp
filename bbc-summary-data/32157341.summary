Why pavements explode and catch fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
So a pavement is just sitting there as per normal, minding its own business as the world passes by.

Then boom, it suddenly explodes or catches fire. Sounds mad doesn't it? Mad... but very possible.
One road in central London is still closed after exactly that happened on Wednesday. The underground fire started just after midnight.
Five-thousand people were evacuated from nearby buildings after smoke came out of a manhole in Holborn.
Dozens of pavements have also exploded in London in the last five years.
The cause of this latest fire isn't yet known but under London's pavements alone there are around 36,000km of cable and 100,000 link boxes, containing electric connections.
Blasts and fires can be caused by electrical faults, often when water's leaked through to exposed cables.
They can also be caused by gas leaks ignited by sparks underground - or gas coming into contact with faulty cables.
The force of explosions can dislodge manhole covers and even small sparks can make really big explosions, especially if there's gas involved.
UK Power Networks, which maintains cables in much of the south and east of England says there can also be problems if other people have contact with their equipment, for example someone digging the street.
It's investing million of pounds a year in dealing with what it calls a "global problem for the industry".
Sand can be used to help insulate cable, absorb water and starve fires of the oxygen it needs to burn.
But UK Power Networks said very few incidents have had an impact above the pavement and the number of explosions should be put in context.
