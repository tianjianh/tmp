[SN]TITLE[SN]
Walsall 1-2 Charlton Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Nicky Ajose scored twice to open his Charlton account as the Addicks ran out 2-1 winners in an entertaining affair at Walsall.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Summer signing Ajose bundled home Athletic's opener just before half-time and netted the winner, also from close range, on 74 minutes, moments after Kieron Morris had fired Walsall level.
Walsall had the best of the opening half-hour but Charlton goalkeeper Declan Rudd made a superb double save on 29 minutes, foiling Simeon Jackson's point-blank strike and Morris' follow-up.
Back came Charlton as Ajose's classy 20-yard chip clipped the top of the bar.
The Addicks claimed a 42nd-minute lead as Ajose netted home from close range after Josh Magennis nodded down Ricky Holmes' inviting cross.
Walsall levelled on 72 minutes as Rudd allowed Morris' speculative 20-yard strike to find the bottom corner.
But the Addicks were back in front within two minutes as Magennis raced past James O'Connor and crossed for Ajose to poke home from a couple of yards.
Walsall almost levelled deep into stoppage time but Rudd pulled off a spectacular save to tip Jackson's volley onto the bar.
