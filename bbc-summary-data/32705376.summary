Network Rail workers have voted in favour of a UK-wide strike in a row over pay, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union has said.

Its members voted 4-1 for action after rejecting pay offers from Network Rail, which owns and maintains most of Britain's railway infrastructure.
Union bosses rejected the offer of a one-off Â£500 payment to staff and three years of rises in line with inflation.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the result showed "the anger" of staff.
"It is now down to Network Rail to start taking this issue seriously, to understand the deep-seated grievance felt by their staff and to come forward with a renewed offer which protects pay and jobs," Mr Cash said.
"The union executive will now consider this overwhelming mandate for action and decide on our next steps aimed at securing pay and workplace justice."
The ballot had a turnout of 60%.
