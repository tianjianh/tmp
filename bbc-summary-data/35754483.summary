[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sir Richard Gozney: Island's 30th Lieutenant Governor sworn in

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Isle of Man's 30th Lieutenant Governor has been sworn into office.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sir Richard Gozney, a former governor of Bermuda and British diplomat, succeeds Adam Wood who stepped down in April after five years.
The Oxford-educated father-of-two said he felt "privileged" to take on the role after a ceremony at the Isle of Man Courts of Justice in Douglas.
The post is appointed by the Queen as the representative of the Crown in the Isle of Man.
The ceremony, normally held in Castletown, was conducted by the first deemster and deputy governor.
The 64-year-old's first official engagement will be a visit to Castletown, the island's ancient capital, this afternoon.
A government spokesman said Mr Gozney recently retired from the British Diplomatic Service after a "distinguished career which culminated as the governor of Bermuda in 2012".
His previous positions include British ambassador to Indonesia and British high commissioner to Nigeria.
Mr Gozney will live in Government House in Douglas and be paid nearly Â£100,000 a year.
