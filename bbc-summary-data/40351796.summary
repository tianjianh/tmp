The Champions League of Darts will be broadcast live on the BBC until 2019 under a new deal with the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC).

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phil Taylor beat Michael van Gerwen to secure the Â£100,000 first prize at the inaugural eight-player event in Cardiff in September 2016.
The 2017 Champions League of Darts returns to Cardiff on 16-17 September.
A change to the qualifying criteria will guarantee that the reigning champion returns to defend his title.
"The Champions League of Darts was a massive success last year," PDC chairman Barry Hearn said.
"This new deal is a reflection of how delighted the BBC were to have the very best players in the sport on terrestrial TV."
