Jermaine Beckford gave Preston the lead, lobbing in following a mix-up between Paul McShane and Ali Al-Habsi.
Stephen Quinn's long-range drive drew Reading level with his first goal for the club.
Johnson wrapped up Preston's first win since a 2-1 victory over Blackburn on 2 April with a 91st-minute finish.
Reading manager Brian McDermott: "If you get back to 1-1, you don't expect to lose that late in the game.
"Walking round that pitch (on a lap of honour) is never good when you've just lost a game that late and also where we've ended up in the league.
"But I've been in this situation before in 2004-05, when we walked around the pitch at Wigan. The following season, we won the league. So that's what I hang on to."
Preston manager Simon Grayson: "The lads showed today that they're not on their holidays. We're making sure we finish the season in a positive manner and get as many points as possible.
"A lot of teams would maybe have settled for a 1-1 draw here, but we keep challenging the players and they've shown again that they've got a fantastic spirit for each other and the club."
