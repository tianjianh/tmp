[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fifteen seal pups have washed up on south Wales' beaches following recent stormy weather.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Five of the pups were picked up over the past few days, the RSPCA said.
The charity said it had rescued young seals from Swansea, Bridgend county, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.
A pup with an infected bite wound to its muzzle was collected from Pembrey. Another sick pup was recovered from Pencarnan near St Davids.
The animals have been transferred to West Hatch Animal Centre, Taunton, Somerset, for rehabilitation.
Anyone who finds a seal on a beach has been asked to avoid touching it as they can bite.
