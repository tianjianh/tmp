Thames Valley Police said the body of Jed Allen had been found at 17:00 BST on Monday.
The bodies of Janet Jordon, 48, her six-year-old daughter Derrin and Philip Howard, 44, were found at their home in Didcot, Oxfordshire, on Saturday.
They had suffered fatal stab wounds, police said.
Det Supt Chris Ward said the force was now not looking for anyone else in connection with the victims' murders.
Mr Ward said though the body found near Marston Ferry Road, Oxford, had not been formally identified, he was satisfied it was Jed Allen.
He said: "The body was discovered in an area of woodland by two members of the public. This area had not previously been searched by police."
The victims' bodies were found in a house in Vicarage Road at about 20:20 BST on Saturday after police were alerted by concerned neighbours.
More than 100 officers - some of them armed - took part in searches, which involved closing Oxford University Parks where Allen used to work as a groundsman.
Earlier, CCTV footage of Allen at Oxford railway station was released.
The footage shows him in WH Smith store on Saturday shortly before 18:00 BST.
Police also confirmed they had recovered a murder weapon from the Didcot crime scene.
Officers had urged members of the public not to approach Allen, who had a distinctive black spider tattoo on his left hand.
Mr Ward, who said an inquest would be carried out in due course, added: "My condolences go out to the families and loved ones.
"We have specially trained officers with the families and will continue to support them at this extremely difficult time.
"I would like to thank the public for all their help during this investigation, as well as their patience while we have been carrying out searches."
A number of people have visited Vicarage Road to leave floral tributes.
John Myers, head teacher of All Saints Primary School in Didcot, where Derrin was a pupil, described her as "a beautiful, happy, gentle, little girl, just a lovely, gentle, little soul... with lots of friends".
Ladygrove Community Centre, next door to the school, is opening its doors to allow staff, children and families to pay tribute to the little girl.
