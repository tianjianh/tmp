[SN]TITLE[SN]
Inquiry into sex offender murder at Barlinnie Prison

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquiry has been ordered into the death of a man who was murdered in prison by his cell mate because he was a sex offender.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Colin Penrose, 22, was found bound and strangled in E Hall at Barlinnie Prison in Glasgow in March 2014.
Fellow prisoner John Clark, who was 21 at the time, was found guilty of murder after claiming it was a prank hostage situation gone wrong.
The hearing will begin on 16 December at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
Jailing Clark for at least 19 years in November 2014, Judge Michael O'Grady told him: "You acted as judge, jury and executioner quite literally in this case."
The High Court in Glasgow was told Clark was motivated by the fact that Penrose, of Oban, was a convicted sex offender.
Now, the Crown Office has said a Fatal Accident Inquiry will be heard into the man's death later this year.
FAIs are mandatory in the case of people who die in prison.
