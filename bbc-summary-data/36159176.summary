The Australian Open semi-finalist joins Heather Watson, Victoria Azarenka and Caroline Wozniacki in the draw.
"I had a good run at the tournament last year, which was the start of a great summer for me," Konta said.
"It's a really strong field which is great for the tournament and I'm hoping for more success in Nottingham."
Croatian teenager Ana Konjuh will return to the Nottingham Tennis Centre to defend her title and British number three Naomi Broady is also set to play in the tournament, which will take place from 4-12 June.
