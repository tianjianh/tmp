David Massey, 54, recorded the doctor, whom he had previously made a complaint about, saying: "What can I do to you? I can probably beat you up, I suppose."
After police were called, one officer suggested leaving him "on the Cat and Fiddle" A537 road in Cheshire. Cheshire Police said they "regret" the incident.
Mr Massey said he thought the incident, in March 2014, was "disgraceful".
The patient, who has diabetes and chronic back pain, went to an out-of-hours clinic at Macclesfield General Hospital.
He says he was in severe pain and needed another pain-relieving patch.
After a long discussion, the doctor refused to give him any medication but Mr Massey declined to leave and started secretly recording the conversation on his phone.
Speaking about how he could get Mr Massey to leave the room, the doctor can be heard saying:  "I can probably beat you up I suppose."
Mr Massey then replies: "You're going to beat me up?", to which the doctor responds: "Yeah".
After police officers spent time trying to get Mr Massey to leave the hospital, a policewoman suggested leaving him on the remote rural road between Buxton and Macclesfield known as the Cat and Fiddle.
An East Cheshire NHS Trust spokesman said the doctor's behaviour was "isolated but not acceptable".
"Both the member of staff concerned and the trust chief executive John Wilbraham have given their apologies to Mr Massey," he added.
Mr Massey said: "I think it is disgraceful really that a doctor can say that to somebody and he's still practising."
A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said: "The constabulary regrets the way the comment by the officer made Mr Massey feel and the officer concerned has taken the learning from this incident."
