Clive Colling has been missing from Bideford in north Devon since New Year's Day.
Police searches involving helicopters and dogs alongside specialist mountain rescue teams from Exmoor and Dartmoor have been looking for nearly a week.
Volunteers met at Northam Burrows near Westward Ho! to offer help trying to find Mr Colling, who has dementia.
Trevor Tomlinson, who helped organise the search over sixteen areas, said: "He may have just got up in the night and went for a walk and got lost, I've got no idea.
"The local community spirit is amazing in this area and I think they all want to try and help."
During the day there were reports Mr Colling had been seen in a nearby cafe but it proved to be a false alarm.
