A comedian dances at a rally of Nigeria's ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) in the south-western town of Akure ahead of Saturday's presidential and parliamentary poll.  Analysts say the vote is evenly split, with the result too close to call but the PDP is confident that it will win its first once more.
The opposition All Progressive Congress (APC) is also confident of victory. Here, its supporters wave brooms in northern Bauchi city to signal their determination to sweep to power in Africa's most populous state.
This man wears a mask of President Goodluck Jonathan in the commercial capital, Lagos. He is facing a strong challenge from Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler who hopes to return to office as an elected president.
Here, a vendor sells sunglasses at his roadside shop in front of posters of the bespectacled Gen Buhari. He is campaigning under the slogan "change".
Gen Buhari and Mr Jonathan have also been courting traditional rulers, who wield influence over voters. These traditional rulers met the president in Owerri in south-east Nigeria, in the final days of campaigning....
The election has been marred by militant Islamist group Boko Haram's six-year insurgency in the north-east. Here, a woman lies in a makeshift hospital in Maiduguri, the former headquarters of Boko Haram...
The militants have been in retreat since regional forces launched an offensive earlier this year to recapture territory. In this photo, a Nigerian soldier is seen entering a building in Bama town. The building was used by the militants as a prison, before they the fled.
This woman in the capital, Abuja, buys meat at a market. Some Nigerians have been stocking up on food, amid fears that the election could trigger violence.
Meanwhile in Lagos, a man is seen drawing water from a well while a woman washes dishes. Despite the country being Africa's main oil producer, most Nigerians are poor, hoping that the party they vote for will improve their lives.
