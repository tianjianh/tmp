[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warrington Wolves secured second place in the Super League table going into the Super 8s by beating Huddersfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Wolves led 16-14 at half-time through tries from Stefan Ratchford, Ben Currie and Ben Westwood, with Gene Ormsby (2) and Aaron Murphy replying.
Nathan Mason put the Giants ahead but the hosts hit back through Chris Sandow and Ryan Atkins to make it 28-20.
Ormsby's third and Craig Huby's score restored the visitors' lead but Daryl Clarke crossed late on to settle it.
With Huddersfield bottom of the table and resigned to playing in the Qualifiers, the meeting in humid and overcast conditions at the Halliwell Jones Stadium lacked intensity.
Warrington raced into a 10-0 lead but lost their way when full-back Ratchford was forced off with injury midway through the first half.
The lead changed hands six times over the afternoon but the Giants were unable to hang on and secure a first win under new coach Rick Stone, despite Ormsby's hat-trick against his former club.
The Wolves face Wakefield in the Challenge Cup semi-finals next Saturday before the start of their Super 8s campaign while Huddersfield have two weeks to prepare for their first fixture in the Qualifiers.
