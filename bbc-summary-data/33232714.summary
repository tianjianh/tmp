M4 relief road not in doubt, says minister Edwina Hart

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The minister who approved plans for a £1bn M4 relief road in south Wales has denied the project is in doubt following her decision to step down.

Transport Minister Edwina Hart announced on Friday she would not seek re-election to the assembly in 2016.
CBI Wales, representing the nation's biggest employers, said it wanted "reassurance" that the road south of Newport would still be built.
Ms Hart said that "everything is in place" for a final decision in 2016.
Plans for the scheme include 24km (15m) of new motorway and a 2.5km-long (1.5m) viaduct crossing the River Usk.
A major remodelling of M4 junctions 23 and 29 is also proposed.
Opposition parties and several Labour AMs are opposed to the plan and some organisations have raised concerns about the cost of the favoured "black" route and its potential impact on the environment.
A public inquiry looking at the proposals is likely to begin in 2016,
Chris Sutton, chairman of CBI Wales, said the delivery of the M4 relief road was a "number one priority for the Welsh economy" and it was important there was "no loss of momentum or change in direction in delivery of this key project".
"We recognise that ministers, and indeed, governments change however the challenge is to quietly 'crack on' in dealing with the long-term issues which form the foundation of future growth," he said.
"We will seek reassurances from the Welsh government in this regard."
However, Mrs Hart played down suggestions the project was now in doubt.
She told BBC Wales:  "Let me make it clear I'm part of a government, I'm part of an administration that has decided to go ahead with this project.
"Everything is in place.
"The decision won't be until 2016 but we've done everything we need to do in terms of how we're looking at the plan developing."
She added: "I wouldn't be so arrogant to give any messages to my ultimate successor.
"All I know is the first minister and myself have been very keen on the project."
Earlier, a Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have announced a preferred route for the project, which we believe is the best solution to transport issues around Newport and is vitally important to the economic prosperity of Wales. Our position on this has not changed."
Iestyn Davies of the Federation of Small Businesses said "a £1bn piece of tarmac for around 13 miles" was not a priority for small businesses.
While he agreed the road around Newport was a "bottleneck", he said the money could be better spent elsewhere to support skills or improve transport across Wales.
Plaid Cymru said a change of Welsh government in 2016 would be a chance to find a "cheaper, quicker, better alternative" to Labour ministers' current plans.
Development work on the road has already begun after three firms were awarded contracts in March.
The Welsh government's statement makes it clear that its position on a new M4 relief road has not changed.
But ultimately the "reassurance" the CBI is looking for can only really come from the next administration.
The project will need majority support in the assembly after the election in May 2016.
With opposition parties and several Labour AMs against the proposed £1bn road, the key factor will be how strong a commitment Labour makes to it in its 2016 manifesto.
And given the long, long history of this idea, it is unsurprising the CBI feels a strong minister in charge is essential.
