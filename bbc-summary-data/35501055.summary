[SN]TITLE[SN]
Convicted Aberdeen rapist Graham Gordon loses compensation bid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An Aberdeen man who tried to sue the Scottish government after failing to overturn his rape conviction has lost his case.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Graham Gordon was jailed for five years after being convicted at the High Court in Stonehaven in 2002.
The trial had heard how Gordon took the woman to his Bridge of Don home after meeting her in a nightclub in 2001.
A Â£695,000 action against the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission and Scottish government has failed.
A sheriff ruled against Gordon and the case has been closed, although the former golf professional can appeal the decision.
He has always denied the attack and claims it was consensual sex.
