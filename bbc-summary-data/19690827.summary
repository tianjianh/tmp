If I were to race in Glasgow it would be in the 200m and 400m but definitely not the 800m. I'm done with that distance
And the 23-year-old is still pondering whether to compete in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow in two years' time.
"Rio is out of reach. I'll be 27 then, and swimming, especially for distance swimmers, is a young person's game," Adlington told the Mail on Sunday.
However, her mother Kay and her agent said Adlington has not made a final decision about competing in Brazil.
Adlington won freestyle gold over 400m and 800m in Beijing in 2008.
She  at London 2012, where she was beaten by 15-year-old American Katie Ledecky in the 800m freestyle.
As well as the Commonwealth Games, where she is considering racing over 200m, the Mansfield swimmer must also decide whether she will target a place in the GB team at next year's World Championships in Barcelona.

"If I was a sprinter then I would go to Rio. But I don't have an ounce of sprinting in me," she added.
"If I were to race in Glasgow - and that's an if - then it would be in the 200m and 400m but definitely not the 800m. I'm done with that distance.
"I'd like to be in Rio, though, even if I'm just a fan. Hopefully I can be a bit more than that, like a mentor, or have some kind of official or unofficial role with the British swimming team."
