Bristol boxer Lee Haskins has called opponent Stuart Hall a "grumpy old man" ahead of Saturday's world title fight.

It is a second defence of his IBF bantamweight belt for Haskins, against the 36-year-old former champion who he beat on points in July 2012.
"He doesn't like me more than I don't like him - I've got no problems with him," Haskins told BBC Points West.
"You'd think it was pantomime wouldn't you, but he definitely has some serious bad blood against me."

The fight is on the undercard to Kell Brook's high-profile middleweight bout against Gennady Golovkin at London's O2 Arena.
Haskins, 32, claims Hall, a mandatory challenger, would never agree to fight him while he held the title.
"I'm the kind of guy that likes to have a bit of banter, a good laugh - he's a grumpy old man and everything I was saying he was biting, and I was just getting under his skin," he said.
"If he's doing this kind of training that I'm doing now, at 36, fair play to him because I know how hard it is - for him to still be doing it at 36, I take my hat off to him.
"I want to stop him within six rounds this time, I want to put him out."
Chris Sanigar, coach to Haskins, hinted they were already looking at his next title defence.
"We just want to get this one out the way but, yes, we are thinking about a date in December," he said.
