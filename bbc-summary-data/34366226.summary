Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:
"Every point we've got we've had to dig deep, it's part of football, it's something that we try and set a team up to give us everything and that's what they have done.
"The goal deserved to win the game. Did we deserve three points? The work we did out of possession and what the authorities have given us to deal with this week, in Peterborough on Tuesday night then there is Colchester, 80 miles apart.
"There's not many teams that will cover that distance over the last four days. That took its toll and took into account. But I'm absolutely delighted with the shift my players have put in."
