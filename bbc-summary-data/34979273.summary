The song is now the UK's longest-reigning number one by a Danish act.
It overtakes Whigfield's Saturday Night and Aqua's Barbie Girl, both of which spent four weeks at the summit.
Meanwhile, Adele returns to the top of the album chart, with 25 achieving its tenth (non-consecutive) week at number one since last November.
According to the Official Charts Company, the record sold more than two-and-a-half times more than its nearest rival, Jess Glynne's I Cry When I Laugh, over the last seven days.
Last week's number one, The 1975's  I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It, drops to sixth place.
The highest new entry comes from Kendrick Lamar, whose surprise release Untitled Unmastered features eight off-cuts from the Grammy-award winning To Pimp A Butterfly.
It arrives at number eight, one place above grime star Kano's Made In The Manor, which has been described as "a heartfelt and daring album that provides an intricate depiction of East End London as it is today".
Other new entries come from Liverpudlian psychedelic band The Coral, whose new record Distance Inbetween lands at number 14, and BBC Sound Of 2015 nominee Lapsley, who makes her chart debut at 32 with Long Way Home.
Back in the singles chart, Swedish star Zara Larsson scores two singles in the Top 10. Her solo hit Lush Life is at number four, spending its twelfth week in the Top 40, while her collaboration with Tinie Tempah, Girls Like, rises to number nine.
Three separate singles all climb 12 places to achieve their chart peak - Fifth Harmony's Work From Home (12), Sia's Cheap Thrills(20) and Alan Walker's Faded (21).
Meanwhile, US pop star Selena Gomez's climbs eight places to Number 32 with the seductive ballad Hands To Myself. The song is expected to rise further next week after the star's brief promotional trip to the UK.
