The 36-year-old, who has played 16 Tests, 41 one-day internationals and 16 T20s, replaces Australia seamer Ben Hilfenhaus as their overseas player.
"Imran has played lots of cricket in England," said Notts director of cricket Mick Newell.
"We know how effective international-class spinners can be during the business end of a county season."
Pakistan-born Tahir has taken 43 Test wickets at an average of 46.39, 72 ODI wickets at 21.54 and 25 T20 wickets at 14.68.
Notts will be his fifth English county after spells with Hampshire, Warwickshire, Yorkshire and Middlesex.
Notts are fifth in the County Championship with five games remaining, and second in the One-Day Cup after two matches.
