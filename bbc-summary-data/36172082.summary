Ferrari confirmed the German's car would need a gearbox change before the permitted cycle of six races.
It is a further blow to the four-time champion's attempts to take a first win for Ferrari this season.
Ferrari said the damage to the gearbox was picked up in Vettel's first-lap collision with team-mate Kimi Raikkonen at the previous race in China.
Vettel, 28, admitted ahead of the Sochi race that there was "a natural sense of pressure, especially from myself" following a tough start to the season that has left him 42 points behind championship leader Nico Rosberg after just three grands prix.
The penalty means the highest he can start the race on Sunday is sixth, although he is more likely to be eighth at best following a dominant performance from world champions Mercedes in Friday practice.
