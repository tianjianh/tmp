Jermaine Hylton: Solihull Moors sign former Swindon Town striker

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Solihull Moors have made their eighth summer signing by recruiting former Swindon Town striker Jermaine Hylton.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 24-year-old, who scored once in 46 games for the Robins, was offered a new contract at the end of the season after Swindon's relegation to League Two.
However, he has now been reunited with Moors boss Liam McDonald, who was manager during Hylton's time at Redditch, the club he left for Swindon.
"I believe he will be the best striker in non-league football," said McDonald.
"Jermaine is a quality goalscorer who needed a change after Swindon's relegation to League Two last season.
"Despite considerable interest from Football League and National League clubs, he has bought into our vision here at Moors and wants to be part of it."
