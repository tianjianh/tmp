Motherwell saw off Ross County in extra time to reach the League Cup quarter-finals, despite finishing the game with 10 men.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Gael Bigirimana broke the deadlock for the visitors, but Alex Schalk burst clear of the defence to make it 1-1.
Chris Cadden gave Motherwell an extra-time lead, but defender Charles Dunne was red-carded and Craig Curran despatched the resulting penalty.
However, Ross MacLean rounded County goalkeeper Scott Fox to win it.
That sets up a home tie for Stephen Robinson's side in the last eight against Aberdeen.
Jim McIntyre started with the same side that won at Dens Park last Saturday, but was quickly forced into a change when midfielder Tim Chow was forced off with a nasty head injury in 13 minutes after an accidental collision.
Jim O'Brien took over but the former Motherwell man initially struggled to stop his old club from preventing his current one making much headway as an attacking force in a fiercely contested first half.
In fact the opening period was largely forgettable with precious few chances at either end, but the game then burst into life in what turned our to be another hour and a quarter of end-to-end action.
The home side were initially the architects of their own downfall when they lost possession far too easily and Motherwell scored with a stunning breakaway goal.
Cadden raced away down the right, Moult headed the winger's hanging cross back in the direction from where it came to find Bigirimana arriving to hammer in his first goal for the club.
Having waited so long for a goal, there should have been another couple within a few minutes. First Schalk somehow shot over the bar from inside the Motherwell six-yard box, while at the other end substitute Alex Fisher dragged his effort wide when it was easier to hit the target.
That proved costly as Schalk converted a much tougher chance when he raced on to a superb defence-splitting O'Brien pass to finish with real composure.
Motherwell edged back in front early into extra time after Fox did well to turn substitute Ryan Bowman's header onto the crossbar, with the impressive Cadden reacting quickest to ram the rebound into the net.
County hauled themselves level for a second time after substitute Curran was wiped out on the line by Dunne, who was red-carded for his trouble.
Curran picked himself up and sent Carson the wrong way from the resulting spot-kick but the 10 men of Motherwell showed great resilience to grab the win.
They gave as good as they got in the second period of extra time and substitute MacLean kept a cool head to round Fox before slotting in the decisive goal to take them into the last eight.
Motherwell manager Stephen Robinson: "We got the performance against Rangers but not the result, but we got both tonight and I think we deserved to get through to the semi final.
"It was a tough game but we showed our battling qualities in the side as everyone involved were brilliant and played their part.
They showed great character when we went down to 10 men, but whether it was a red car or not we will have to see and may appeal.
"Now we have a great draw at home to a very good Aberdeen and we will look forward to that when it comes around."
Ross County manager Jim McIntyre: "It was a bit like a boxing match with both sides slugging it out with a lot of tasty challenges and plenty goal attempts from both teams.
"The players showed a lot of character but we have to be a bit more streetwise as the goal we lost at the end was really poor.
"We have to take it on the chin as it is sore one as we had aspirations to be in the quarter finals but it wasn't to be.
"That was our first defeat in 14 games going back into last season so what we have to do is pick ourselves up and make sure we start another good run when Aberdeen come here on Saturday."
