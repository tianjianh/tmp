Edmund, making only his second Davis Cup appearance, won 6-3 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to give Britain, who were without Andy Murray, an unassailable 3-1 lead.
Britain will now play Argentina at home in September as they aim to defend the title they won in Belgium last year.
Following Edmund's win, James Ward lost 6-2 3-6 7-5 to Janko Tipsarevic to make the final score 3-2 to Britain.
Edmund, 21, was playing as Britain's top-ranked singles player after Murray chose to sit out the tie following his Wimbledon success.
It was the first time Britain have won a World Group match in the Davis Cup without their number one player.
Facing Lajovic, the highest ranked player in Serbia's squad following Novak Djokovic's decision to miss the tie, Edmund produced one of the best performances of his career, hitting 27 forehand winners and 39 in total.
The world number 67 served for the match at 5-4 but Lajovic broke back before the Yorkshireman rallied to take the match on a tie-break.
"You want to win for your country," said Edmund. "When you know what is at stake... I'm so pleased that I've won."
Edmund had beaten Tipsaveric in the first singles rubber on Friday to give Britain a 1-0 lead.
Lajovic then beat Ward in the second singles match on Saturday before Jamie Murray and Dom Inglot put Britain in front again with victory in the doubles.
Team captain Leon Smith has now won 14 of his 16 Davis Cup matches since taking the job in 2010.
He was full of praise for Edmund's performances this year and last.
"I have seen Kyle develop a lot," said Smith. "To get your first Davis Cup win is something, to get two in one weekend is something very special indeed."
Former Great Britain Davis Cup captain John Lloyd: "It was a gutsy performance and Kyle had faith in his game. He didn't pull back, he stood firm and withstood Lajovic's best games at the end.
"That will mean so much that Kyle came through in that sort of pressure. What that could do for his career is amazing."
Former Great Britain Davis Cup player Jamie Baker: "He was rock-solid at the end. He's never been in a situation like that before.
"His forehand, in terms of pace and what he can do with it is in the top five, of the world but he can always improve his movement."
Britain will face Argentina in the last four after the South Americans completed a 3-1 away victory against Italy.
France - featuring Wimbledon doubles champions Pierre-Hugues Herbert and Nicolas Mahut, as well as singles quarter-finalists Lucas Pouille and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga - beat the Czech Republic 3-1.
They will face Croatia, who came from 2-0 down to beat the United States.
