The 10-day event runs from 20 to 29 January next year.
Other acts added to the programme for the south of Scotland event are Peatbog Faeries, Skerryvore and Dervish.
Proceedings will also see a carnival on 22 January on the theme of Tam O' Shanter with more than 2,000 people involved.
The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, Charlie Landsborough, Seth Lakeman and Hackney Colliery Band have already been announced.
Organisers have promised "something for everybody" including the return of the Le Haggis cabaret show which is now in its fourth edition.
A special Burns Night Live event on 25 January will be hosted by acclaimed local folk artist Emily Smith.
A new element this year is the community development project Transform Dumfries, which will see eight neighbourhood "hubs" presenting 35 different events.
They will take place in Lochside, Lincluden, Troqueer, Locharbriggs, Georgetown, Calside and will include a town centre hub at The Stove, and a children's hub at the Theatre Royal.
The aim is to encourage more local participation.
Executive Producer Graham Main said: "Transform Dumfries is about audiences being at the centre of the celebration in their own distinctive way.
"It's all about getting people involved and inviting more people to come and celebrate.
"The idea that there are parties and events happening in every nook and cranny of Dumfries helps to re-energise Dumfries as a cultural winter destination."
