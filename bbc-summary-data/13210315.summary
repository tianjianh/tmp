[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents of the Irish village where Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb in 1979 are forging links with the Hampshire town where he lived.

An exhibition about Mullaghmore, Co Sligo is being held in Romsey, near the Mountbattens' Broadlands Estate.
May Burns from Mullaghmore said: "The majority of people were very ashamed. It's a good time to heal old wounds."
The towns' connection dates back to the 19th Century when Mullaghmore was part of the Broadlands Estate.
Lord Mountbatten, who was 79 when he was assassinated by the IRA, was a regular holiday visitor to the Co Sligo fishing village.
He was the Queen's cousin and his grandson, Lord Brabourne, is one of Prince William's godfathers.
An earlier Broadlands owner, Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, built Mullaghmore's harbour in 1820.
Residents of the town, many of whom clearly remember the events of 1979, have visited Romsey to stage an exhibition about their village's history.
John McKeon said: "We need to forge relationships and there are a lot of things shared by both communities."
They will also carry out more research into the history of the harbour at the University of Southampton's Broadlands Archive.
Romsey historian Phoebe Merrick, who has visited Mullaghmore, said: "I was very struck by how much they minded their harbour being used for that dreadful assassination - it still sears their souls."
