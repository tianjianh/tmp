On Thursday 19 February the mystery will be solved - as part of EastEnders' 30th anniversary week.
A video was put up on Twitter after the dramatic New Year's Day episode, which kept everyone guessing about who the killer might be.
The revelation will be one of the birthday week highlights, which kicks off from Monday 16 February.
On New Year's Day former police officer, Emma Summerhayes, was about to reveal who Lucy's killer was when she was knocked down by Roxy Mitchell and rushed to hospital.
Emma was texting the killer when she was hit.
"But that doesn't change anything it's still murder," she said, earlier in the episode.
One half of the Beale twins, Lucy had a short but eventful life.
She's been held hostage, mugged, run away from home and made life as difficult as possible for her dad Ian Beale's various love interests.
Her body was found on Walford Common on Good Friday.
Suspects have included Lucy's lover Max and her new boyfriend Lee Carter, but it won't be long before we'll find out for sure.
Brithday celebrations will include a 30-minute live episode and there will also be a series of live elements in all the episodes that week.
Charlotte Moore, Controller of BBC One says: "It will bring the nation together to celebrate 30 years of EastEnders by going live across the anniversary week."
"It will mark a massive event by creating the ultimate 'doof doof' and finally reveal who killed Lucy Beale," she added.
