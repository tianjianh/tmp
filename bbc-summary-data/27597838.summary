Bangor University has signed a deal to create a new college in China.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a joint venture between Bangor and a Chinese university, Bangor College will open its doors to 200 students in Changsha City, Hunan Province, in September.
It will offer courses in accounting, banking, finance and electronic engineering.
Staff will include lecturers from Bangor University and courses will be taught in English.
Students can study in Bangor, Gwynedd, for up to two years if they choose, or complete all their work in China.
The aim is to provide "a UK-style higher education experience" to undergraduates, and it is hoped to expand the range of courses in the future, as well as increasing the number of students to 2,000.
Prof John G. Hughes, Bangor University vice-chancellor, said: "This is a historic agreement for both institutions.
"It brings the excellent quality of higher education provided by Bangor University closer to students in China and also provides exciting opportunities for Bangor's students and academics to experience an exchange of learning and ideas in China."
The new college is a joint venture between Bangor University and the Central South University of Forestry and Technology (CSUFT), in China, and a signing ceremony was held in Bangor on Tuesday.
Xianyan Zhou, CSUFT president, said it was the result "of the successful co-operation between both institutions over the past four years".
