[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three men died in a plane crash in Afghanistan after misunderstandings between air traffic control and the aircraft's crew, an inquest has heard.

Christopher Carter, 51, of Caerphilly, Wales; David Taylor, 28, of Stoke-on-Trent; and Daniel Saville, 40, of Bradford, died in the crash near Kabul in 2010.
Accidental death verdicts were recorded for all three.
Bradford coroner Neil Cameron said each of the men suffered multiple injuries.
The inquest heard that crew on the plane contacted air traffic control to ask for permission to descend shortly before the crash.
The air traffic controller asked the crew to maintain their current altitude but the plane began its descent in bad weather into a mountainous area about 12 miles (19km) from Kabul.
The coroner said the air traffic controller could have warned the crew they were descending too quickly and "into danger".
Mr Cameron said an early ground proximity warning system was misunderstood by the crew, either due to language or because of previous false alerts.
The families of the three men attended the inquest, which was held at Bradford Crown Court.
Jim Morris, a barrister representing the families, applied to the coroner to adjourn the inquest to allow evidence from the air traffic controller to be made available, but Mr Cameron declined to adjourn.
The families said they were "disappointed" and "angry" that the coroner would not adjourn the inquest.
Kim Taylor, Mr Taylor's mother, said: "We are angry that the coroner would not adjourn the inquest for the evidence of the air traffic controller.
"We cannot fully come to terms with losing David."
Chioma Ibe, Mr Saville's partner, said: "We are disappointed that five years on we have no closure, no answers and no apology.
"I feel let down by the coroner who did not assist in including important evidence."
Mr Morris, who is a partner in at a legal firm's aviation law team and a former RAF pilot, said the families would continue their search for answers.
