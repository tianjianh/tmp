The three-day international event is the final stage of the world rally championships and sees 160 competitors taking on the forest stage.
Entrants include Elfyn Evans, 25, from Dolgellau, son of former British rally champion Gwyndaf Evans.
Thousands attended a firework launch in Eirias Park Stadium, Colwyn Bay, on Thursday night, from where the rally began.
It is the second year the rally has started in north Wales after moving from its previous base in Cardiff.
The course takes drivers through forests in Snowdonia, Denbighshire and mid Wales.
The rally started with the Gartheiniog Forest stage.
It was the first time spectators were able to view this stage, which organisers described as 18km of "pure challenge" for the competitors.
All the way through the forest there were tight technical corners, fast open sweeping roads and big climbs as well as steep downhill sections.
The event is the 13th and final stage of this year's World Rally Championship.
It is a three-day route comprising of 23 competitive stages, with all 191 miles against the clock.
Friday's action will see the drivers competing through mid Wales and they will eventually make their way back up to north Wales on Sunday, where the winner will be crowned in Llandudno.
