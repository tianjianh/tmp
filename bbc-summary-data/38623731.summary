[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mr Jedrzejewski, who lived in the city, was found on Keene Street, Lliswerry, at around 23:00 GMT on Thursday.
He was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital, where he later died.
Two men aged 18 and a 17-year-old boy were arrested on Friday and a 43-year-old man was arrested on Saturday.
All four were arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently in police custody.
Gwent Police said it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident but is appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time to come forward.
Officers are particularly interested in speaking to a girl in her late teens or early 20s who was seen walking into Keene Street and a boy who was riding his bike along Cromwell Road.
They also want to speak to the driver of a silver hatchback car seen turning into Keene Street just after the incident.
Supt Glyn Fernquest said: "If this is you then please get in touch, as you may hold vital evidence that can help us with our investigation - please be reassured that you are not in any trouble."
