The vessel was spotted by a merchant ship shortly before 16:00 BST on Saturday about 25 miles north-east of North Foreland in Thanet.
Coastguard crews have been searching the area nearby.
The catamaran is a white new Hobie Cat 12 model with the serial number 7064-1999 and make number K-0566.
A spokesman for the RNLI said the craft still had a sail rigged when it was found.
It has been recovered and is being kept at the Port of Ramsgate.
Anyone with information about who may have been sailing the vessel is asked to contact Kent Police or the coastguard.
