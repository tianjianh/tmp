A specialist robot with a high-pressured jet has been imported from The Netherlands for the job in Houghton Regis - the first time it has ever had to be used in East Anglia.
There are still a few days' work left to remove the fat, which has set like concrete over some years, despite the job starting on Monday.
Anglian Water has warned about people pouring fat down the sink, saying blockages cost bill payers Â£15m a year.
