Conor Morgan, from Kilcoo, County Down, was working on the site near Shott Farm on Hamilton Road in High Blantyre at about 09:45 BST on Wednesday.
Paramedics treated Mr Morgan, but he died at the scene.
He worked for Newry firm Re-Gen Waste but was working at the Avant Homes construction site.
Canon Sean Rogan of St Malachy's Parish said the local community is heartbroken.
"Conor was a very hard working member of the parish. He leaves a wife and three teenage boys," he said.
"We had a five thirty mass here on Sunday morning, on Easter Sunday, a dawn mass, and Conor was there at that mass and then after that he got his lorry and went off to work in Scotland. It's so sad, so tragic."
In a statement, Re-Gen Waste described Mr Morgan as a popular employee who would be missed by the "entire Re-Gen family".
Avant Homes said an investigation has been launched and all work at the site had been suspended.
A spokeswoman for the company said their thoughts and condolences were with Mr Morgan's family.
