The Communication Workers Union said it had struck a deal with Royal Mail after about 700 workers staged a walkout.
The action affected the main mail centre in Swindon as well as offices in Royal Wootton Bassett, Faringdon, Devizes and Chippenham, the union said.
Royal Mail confirmed that its employees had now returned to work.
A spokesman said: "Mail deliveries and collections have now resumed.
"We are working to ensure any disruption to mail services as a result of today's action is minimised."
