[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Huge waves whipped up by 65mph winds caused damage to homes, hotels and vehicles in Devon and Cornwall over the weekend.

Travel on trains was also disrupted as the sea topped defences in Dawlish and in Torcross, south Devon, some people were trapped in their seafront homes by the power of the waves.
In Penzance, Cornwall, a driver became stranded when huge waves engulfed his car on a seafront road during the storms.
Mobile phone footage captured the moment passers-by went to the driver's aid, and helped him restart the car and drive to safety.
At the same spot a driver narrowly escaped being washed away as he crossed the flooded seaside road.
Camera phone footage shows the car being buffeted by the waves before it reaches safety.
In St Mawes a hotel's ground floor was flooded after waves smashed in windows and a bolt of lightning was caught on camera striking Falmouth.
