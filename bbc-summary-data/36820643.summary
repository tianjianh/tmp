The unprovoked attack happened outside EQHQ on Almondside in Livingston at about 02:40 on Saturday.
Police said the 21-year-old was standing outside the club when he was approached from behind and struck on the head.
He was knocked unconscious and taken to St John's Hospital with serious facial injuries.
The suspect was described as being white, 5ft 11in tall, of slim build, with black curly hair.
He was wearing a long-sleeved dark T-shirt, blue jeans and Calvin Klein boxer shorts.
Det Con Ally Urquhart said: "This appears to be a completely unprovoked attack which has caused a man serious facial injuries, for which he will require ongoing treatment.
"We'd urge anyone who may have witnessed this, who saw the suspect in the area around this time, or who recognises his description, to come forward."
