BBC can afford to spend more on TV in Wales, says minister

Deputy Culture Minister Ken Skates has said he "rejects the idea" the BBC cannot afford to spend more on television programming in Wales.

The money "could be allocated if the BBC so wishes", he told an assembly inquiry into the BBC Charter Review.
Ministers have previously said there was a "lamentable" lack of BBC Wales comedy and drama in English.
The BBC has said it was working with devolved governments to meet audience aspirations around the UK.
Earlier in November, First Minister Carwyn Jones repeated his call for an additional Â£30m to be spent on English language programmes that reflect Welsh life.
Mr Skates told the communities, equality and local government committee: "The BBC's budget is significant and I reject the idea they aren't able to allocate more resources to English language - particularly non-news - programming in Wales.
"I think the money could be allocated if the BBC so wishes."
The BBC has warned it faced a "tough financial challenge" following the licence fee settlement in July.
In his evidence to the assembly's inquiry, Mr Skates also reiterated the Welsh government's call for a review of the BBC's public purposes in Wales to determine the broadcaster's responsibilities to Welsh audiences.
Mr Skates said he would establish a media panel to carry out the review of the BBC's role in Wales if the work did not form part of the UK government's wider review of the BBC's charter.
At a media summit in Cardiff last week, the BBC's director of strategy James Purnell said the corporation was "committed" to Welsh audiences.
The BBC's new charter, setting out its 10-year remit, is due to come into force in January 2017.
