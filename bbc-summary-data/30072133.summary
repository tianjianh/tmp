The fight will be at the Manchester Arena on 23 January after Crolla, 27, beat Gyorgy Mizsei Jnr of Hungary on points in Dublin on Saturday.
Crolla said: "I am a Manchester lad so to be fighting in Manchester for a world title, I couldn't ask for anything more.
"The only way it could get better than that is to go out there and win it."
Crolla is the WBO Inter-Continental lightweight champion and former British champion.
Abril, 32, is the reigning WBA champion with a record of 19 wins from 23 fights whose last defence saw him end Finland fighter Edis Tatli's unbeaten record in Helsinki in September.
