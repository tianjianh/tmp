Glamorgan picked up a second One-Day Cup win in three days as superior fielding helped them defend a target of 303 against Sussex in Cardiff.

Chris Cooke's 80 off 67 balls and Graham Wagg's brutal 52 late on helped Glamorgan post 302-6.
Aneurin Donald and Will Bragg built the platform after captain Jacques Rudolph retired hurt after a blow on the arm.
Captain Luke Wright led the Sussex effort with 65 but lacked support as the visitors were bowled out for 218.
Glamorgan skipper Rudolph watched his batsmen accelerate in the sunshine, helped by a series of dropped catches, before heading to hospital for an X-ray which showed no break.
England all-rounder Chris Jordan and spinner Danny Briggs were the pick of a mixed-quality Sussex attack, before Glamorgan plundered 118 off the last 10 overs.
Sussex lost wickets too regularly early in their innings to mount a challenge, with a stunning caught-and-bowled by Craig Meschede to remove New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor highlighting the difference in the field between the sides.
Wright and Ben Brown put on 68 for the fifth wicket but when Wright was superbly caught by stand-in skipper Colin Ingram, it marked the realistic end of the visitors' challenge before Michael Hogan (4-41) finished off the tail.
Glamorgan have two wins from two in the South Group, while Sussex remain without a win in 50-over cricket since 2014.
Glamorgan acting captain Colin Ingram told BBC Wales Sport: "My coach at under-elevens used to say 'catches win matches' and that's obviously relevant. No-one drops catches on purpose but our catching was outstanding tonight.
"They definitely change momentum, every time they got a partnership going we took a good catch and dragged ourselves back into it.
"On this wicket, the new ball is definitely a threat and we negated that pretty well. Then the way Graham (Wagg) and Chris Cooke batted together, they built that outstanding partnership and gave us the momentum to kick on in the last 15 overs.
"Jacques is fine, basically it was a solid hit (on the arm) and a big bruise, and you lose feeling in the hand for a while, it's a stressful moment but he'll have to toughen up and get back out with us soon."
Sussex captain Luke Wright told BBC Sussex: "It hurts a hell of a lot, to be honest.
"It's very, very frustrating. Catches win matches and we put down five which were pretty simple. Credit to them, they took a couple of great catches that changed the game."
