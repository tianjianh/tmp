[SN]TITLE[SN]
Glasgow college lecturers call off planned strikes

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lecturers at colleges in Glasgow will not take part in two planned national strikes next week.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It follows a decision by the city's three further education colleges to join a national pay bargaining system.
Members of the EIS union at other colleges across Scotland are due to strike on Tuesday and Wednesday in a separate dispute over pay.
The Glasgow lecturers may now be balloted to decide if they join future action in the wider pay dispute.
The Glasgow lecturers had joined a one-day strike on Thursday, prior to the local pay bargaining dispute being settled.
EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said a "U-turn" by the Glasgow colleges marked a "significant early victory in the campaign for fair pay in all Scottish colleges".
He said: "The Glasgow colleges had refused to sign up to the national bargaining process, in the mistaken belief that this would remove them from their obligations on a fair pay offer.
"The strike action by our members has forced a quick change of mind on the part of the Glasgow colleges, and the EIS welcomes this development today."
Mr Flanagan added, "While these Glasgow disputes are now settled the national action in pursuit of a fair national pay offer and pay equality in all colleges will continue.
"Two days of strike action in this campaign are planned for next week, and these will take place in all colleges where lecturers have been balloted as part of the national dispute.
"Lecturers in the three Glasgow colleges, who are not currently part of the national action, will now be re-balloted as soon as possible to allow them to join their colleagues across Scotland in future strike days as part of the national campaign for fair pay."
