[SN]TITLE[SN]
Retired Welwyn Garden City police officer jailed for sex offences

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A retired police officer has been jailed for 22 months for sexually abusing an underage girl 45 years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Peck, 80, was convicted at St Albans Crown Court of indecently assaulting the girl, when she was 14 and 15.
The victim, now 60, came forward in 2013 prompted by the Jimmy Savile case.
Peck, of Buxton Road, Waltham Forest, had worked in Welwyn Garden City. The woman told the court he kissed her and took her on car trips for sexual acts.
He had already admitted two charges of indecent assault, but was found guilty of a further five charges.
Judge Jonathan Carroll told Peck: "She was a child. You were an adult.  You showed manipulative and predatory behaviour."
