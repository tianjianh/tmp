A paralysed woman who was banned from competing in a 10k race in a "bionic" suit has been told she can now enter.

Organisers of the Vitality London 10k had said Claire Lomas could not take part because UK Athletics rules prohibited motors.
She walked the London Marathon in 17 days in the suit after she broke her back in a horse-riding accident.
Ms Lomas said she was "grateful" organisers will allow her to run as an "unofficial" entry.
She said on her Twitter account: "I'll start at 5am - there will be a finish 4 me if I make it - also a medal if I complete."
The 35-year-old, from Leicestershire, broke her neck, back and ribs and punctured a lung when her horse threw her off as she took part in the Osberton Horse Trials in Nottinghamshire.
Organisers were not available for comment but Ms Lomas said they "wanted to make it possible for me to do it".
"It is up to the organisers to make a decision and they have not changed the rules, but they are allowing me to do it unofficially."
She added: "The legs move [with the help of the suit] but they only move by me giving it signals for every step and that's by using the parts of my body that aren't paralysed.
"I work hard for every step, even balancing in the suit is challenging."
