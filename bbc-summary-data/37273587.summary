Penarth Road in Grangetown shut at its junction with Corporation Road and Clare Road following a collision between the two vehicles.
The mail van then crashed into a nearby building. The two people in the police car were taken to hospital.
The road was shut for nearly six hours while recovery operations took place.
South Wales Police said the two people were treated for injuries which were not life-threatening. The collision happened shortly after 03.30 BST.
Buses were diverted along Avondale Road and Clare Road at the One Stop shop to avoid the closure.
A Royal Mail spokeswoman said: "We can confirm that a Royal Mail vehicle was involved in a road traffic accident this morning at 3.40am near the junction with Clare Road and Penarth Road, Cardiff.
"The male driver was shaken up, but thankfully not seriously injured."
