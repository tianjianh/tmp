Skegness pavilion: Community hub plan closer

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A "rotten" Victorian pavilion in Skegness will be handed over if £3.5m of funding is secured for a community hub to be built in its place.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skegness Town Council wants to create the hub on the site of Tower Gardens Pavilion, which dates back to 1879.
East Lindsey District Council, which owns the building, said it was backing the move.
Funding of £3.5m is being sought from the Coastal Communities Fund, after a successful first round bid.
If the bid is successful, work could start in 2017.
The proposed hub would include a tearoom, heritage museum and tourist information centre
Previous attempts to save the building, which has been empty since 2007, have been unsuccessful, and a survey found rising damp, corrosion, holes in the roof, collapsed floors and rotting woodwork.
