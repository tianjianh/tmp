As the world number five again struggled on the greens, he finished poorly with a double bogey at the 16th and further dropped shot at the last.
McIlroy's round include three birdies and two further bogeys and he ended in a tie for 31st.
American Patrick Reed won by one shot on nine under.
It was Reed's first victory of the season and was enough to secure his place in the USA Ryder Cup team.
American Sean O'Hair and Argentina's Emiliano Grillo were joint second while world number one Jason Day was among three players on seven under.
Rickie Fowler led going into Sunday's final round but he finished three strokes behind Reed.
