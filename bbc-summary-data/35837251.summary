The 18-year-old man is still in hospital after the incident at Leicester's West Gate School on 27 January.
The school subsequently suspended three female members of staff.
Police confirmed the women were arrested in connection with allegations of neglect offences and then bailed pending further inquiries.
Chair of governors, the Rev Canon Peter Taylor, said: "A number of investigations are being carried out into the circumstances of this tragic incident.
"Three members of staff have been suspended while these take place."
A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said the pupil "sustained injuries as a result of getting into difficulty in a swimming pool in Glenfield Road."
She added that the women "aged 49, 61 and 62, have been arrested in connection with the incident on neglect offences".
Leicester City Council and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are also investigating.
The school - which caters for students aged four to 19 with learning difficulties and disabilities - was officially opened by Prince Edward last year.
