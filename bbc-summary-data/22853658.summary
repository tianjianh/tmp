Talking about the tour they said: "The thing we love most about music is performing and we are so excited to get out on the road for our first ever tour. Playing our album to fans will be brilliant."
Josh from the band told more than one million Twitter followers that he is "sooo excited" for the tour to start.
The band, who finished fourth in last year's X Factor, recently signed a book deal to record their journey so far.
