Manchester City striker Toni Duggan says the England players are making it hard for manager Mark Sampson to pick his squad for the World Cup in June.

England play China in Manchester on Thursday, their final home friendly before the tournament in Canada.
Sampson, who took charge in 2013, says he has not yet finalised his squad and there are still places to play for.
"As players we have a responsibility to make it as difficult as possible for him," Duggan, 23, told BBC Sport.
"But once the squad is named we'll come together and fight for each other on the pitch."
Duggan was sidelined by knee surgery earlier in the year but now hopes to convince Sampson she should be on the plane to Canada.
"It would be a dream to go to my first World Cup," she said. "I'll be giving it everything in the last few sessions and the game against China to make sure I get that place."
Sampson says there could still be an opportunity for someone to make the squad by impressing in the Women's Super League.
"There is still an opportunity for players to do that whether it's in the game on Thursday against a very good China team or through the WSL," he said.
"I'm sure someone will come out of the woodwork, someone whose off the radar at the moment but will have a great first half of the season and stake a claim to get a place."
