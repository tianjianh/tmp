[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales have been given an additional allocation of 4,177 tickets for their Euro 2016 group games.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has received more than three times as many applications for Euro 2016 group matches than it has tickets.
The FAW had been keen to try and secure more tickets for fans.
Uefa have increased Wales' ticket allocation from 17,000 to 21,177 for the three Group B matches in June.
The allocation for the opening game against Slovakia in Bordeaux on 11 June has increased from 7,000 to 8,969.
Wales fans have been allocated an extra 202 tickets for the game against England in Lens on 16 June.
And an extra 2,000 tickets have been made available to Wales fans for the match against Russia in Toulouse on 20 June.
Supporters will find out by the end of February if their applications have been successful.
The deadline for gold members' ticket applications closed on Monday, 18 January.
Playing at smaller venues means Wales have a lower ticket allocation than most of the 24 teams in Euro 2016.
Northern Ireland have an allocation of 25,000 for their three group games but have received more than 50,000 ticket applications.
