Cambridge United 1-0 Exeter City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cambridge maintained their League Two play-off hopes with a narrow win over fellow challengers Exeter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
U's captain Leon Legge struck what proved to be the decisive goal after 29 minutes, powering a header beyond Christy Pym from Piero Mingoia's free-kick.
Exeter had earlier spurned a glorious chance to go ahead when Joel Grant blazed over after Ollie Watkins' shot was deflected into his path in space.
Luke Berry almost made it 2-0 six minutes before half-time when a kick from goalkeeper Will Norris ran all the way through to him, only for his effort to land on the roof of the net before Norris produced a magnificent point-blank save to keep out Reuben Reid's header.
Needing a result to solidify their own play-off spot, Exeter saw a Grant effort blocked by Legge and Lee Holmes volleyed well wide when a clearance fell to him.
Eleven minutes from the end Norris made another critical save to parry a header from the unmarked David Wheeler to preserve the lead for Cambridge, who are a point from the top seven.
