Camilla heard about the work of Social Bite, which feeds, trains and employs members of the homeless community.
The Rose Street shop hosted Clooney in November and staff are expected to welcome fellow actor and campaigner Leonardo DiCaprio later this year.
It will be DiCaprio's first visit to Scotland.
The visit by the Duchess of Rothesay, as Camilla is known in Scotland, comes on the second day of a full week of engagements north of the border.
Later on Wednesday, her husband Charles opened The Prince's Trust's youth employment and enterprise hub in Glasgow before being joined by Camilla at Dumfries House near Cumnock in East Ayrshire, the 18th-century stately home whose future was secured following intervention by the Duke of Rothesay in 2007.
The couple attended a sewing bee challenge and opened a new maze before watching pets go through their paces in the annual Dumfries House dog show.
Tuesday saw Charles praise the skills of workers assembling a new aircraft carrier bearing his name at Rosyth dockyard on the Firth of Forth.
He toured the HMS Prince of Wales and spoke to the construction team and crew members before watching crane operators lower the final 570-tonne section into place.
The 280-metre carrier, the eighth ship to be named after the heir to the throne, is expected to start sea trials in 2019.
Charles had earlier visited Perth sporran makers Margaret Morrison where he was given a tour of the workshop.
