A week after winning the French International in Orleans, the 26-year-old top seed beat Dmytro Zavadsky of the Ukraine 21-16 21-12 in 30 minutes.
Zavadsky, the second seed, led 8-4 and 13-11 before Ouseph won seven points in a row and swiftly wrapped up the match.
Scotland's Imogen Bankier also took a second title in a week after partnering Petya Nedelcheva to the doubles crown.
Last week in Orleans, Bankier teamed up with Robert Blair to win the mixed doubles title at the French International.
On Sunday, she and Bulgarian Nedelcheva were in front throughout in defeating Denmark's Lena Grebak and Maria Helsbol 21-10 21-14 in 30 minutes.
