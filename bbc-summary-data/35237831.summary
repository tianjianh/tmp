HGV driver charged with flouting bridge ban

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A lorry driver has been charged after attempting to drive an articulated HGV over the Forth Road Bridge.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Vehicles over 7.5 tonnes are currently banned from the bridge while damaged steel work is repaired.
Police Scotland said traffic had to be stopped heading northbound on the bridge on Tuesday morning to allow the HGV to be turned around.
The bridge was closed to all vehicles for almost three weeks but reopened on 23 December.
However, HGVs face a lengthy diversion until at least mid-February.
A spokesman for Police Scotland:  "Around 10.40am on Tuesday 5 January an articulated HGV attempted to cross the Forth Road Bridge while restrictions were in place.
"Officers temporarily stopped traffic heading northbound to allow the HGV to be turned around safely.
"The male driver was subsequently charged with using a prohibited vehicle on a restricted road.
"The public are thanked for their patience and cooperation during this time."
The bridge was closed to all traffic on 4 December after a crack was discovered in a truss under the carriageway.
Engineers have made a temporary repair enabling lighter vehicles to use the bridge.
Transport minister Derek Mackay has said he hopes the crossing can reopen to all vehicles in mid-February if the weather holds and no further defects are detected.
