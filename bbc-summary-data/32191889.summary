Academy product Manfredi, 21, has scored 14 tries in 19 appearances since making his debut against Hull in 2013.
Manfredi began this season playing for Championship side Workington on dual-registration but an injury to England wing Josh Charnley gave him his chance.
"Whenever he has played he's done well and I firmly believe that he has a big future," said Wigan coach Shaun Wane.
"I am very happy to get this deal done. Dom is a player that I really like. He works hard in training, gets his head down and always wants to improve.
"He's exactly the kind of person I like to work with and he's very talented too," Wane added to the club website.
Manfredi, who scored his third try in his last two matches in the Good Friday win over St Helens, said: "To hear Shaun Wane praise me and say the things he has said is great.
"I have enjoyed my seven years at Wigan and it is an honour to wear the famous Cherry and White shirt.
"I plan to keep working hard now, taking any opportunities that I get and giving Shaun something to think about."
