The comedian set up the Trew Era Cafe on the New Era estate, Hackney, last year.
The Rehabilitation for Addicted Prisoners Trust (RAPT) called the donation a "wonderful opportunity" for them to strengthen their work.
Brand joked: "If I ever get sent down I hope this'll mean I get a cushy job in the library."
He set up the cafe, named after the comedian's YouTube show The Trews, as a social enterprise.
It was staffed by former drug addicts who were in abstinence-based recovery.
RAPT's London Recovery Hub is located next door to the Trew Era Cafe.
David Bernstein, RAPT chairman of trustees, said: "This is a wonderful opportunity for RAPT to further strengthen our employment and enterprise activities for ex-offenders and recovering addicts.  We're enormously grateful to Russell for his generosity in donating the Cafe."
