Nottinghamshire police officer sacked over 'inappropriate' conduct

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A male police officer has been dismissed for "sexually inappropriate" conduct towards female colleagues.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
A Nottinghamshire Police misconduct hearing heard PC Ateeq Syed, 39, had been "inappropriate, degrading and unprofessional" towards the women.
The panel found he had breached five counts relating to the standards of professional behaviour.
He had denied six allegations of gross misconduct.
Mr Syed, who was dismissed following a five-day internal conduct hearing, has been told he can appeal the decision.
The allegations against the 39-year-old related to a period between 24 February 2014 and 1 December 2015.
Det Insp Louise Jordan said: "We expect the highest standards of behaviour from those employed by Nottinghamshire Police.
"The actions of officers define us as a police force and are paramount to protecting the public and maintaining their trust and confidence in the policing of Nottinghamshire.
"Ensuring officers and staff who serve the public act in line with our values is of great importance and we will continue to hold your trust in us in our highest regard."
She said the force would "act accordingly, transparently and honestly where we recognise a failure".
