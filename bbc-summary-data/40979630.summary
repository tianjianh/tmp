The 25-year-old was hurt in a challenge with Maidenhead's Dave Tarpey, which resulted in a penalty being awarded and Langley being sent off.
"Josh is gutted after playing such a big role in getting us into this division," boss Dave Challinor said.
"There is a long road to recovery ahead for Josh and we will help him in any way that we can."
