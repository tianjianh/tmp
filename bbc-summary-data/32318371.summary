The "one force" model will see officers deployed anywhere instead of working in traditional geographical areas.
There has also been a change in shift patterns to try to match the number of officers on duty to the number of emergency calls.
The force said it was also looking to make savings by sharing services with South Yorkshire Police.
Chief Constable Justine Curran said the changes would mean the force would be "better able to police the area at peak times."
She said: "The public will still have the community officers and PCSOs they know and trust in their areas and they'll also now have local community detectives, a real step forward."
The changes were instigated by the Humberside Police and Crime Commissioner Matthew Grove.
A spokesman for Mr Grove said these changes would save the force about £22m by 2019.
