An undisclosed fee has been agreed for Goodliffe, 17, who will sign in the summer when the transfer window opens.
Free agent Harris, also 17, arrives following a successful trial.
Goodliffe has made four National League appearances for Wood since the turn of the year, playing a full 90 minutes against both Forest Green and Tranmere.
Boreham Wood academy captain Goodliffe, who has agreed a contract until May 2019, will be allowed to finish his education and play the rest of this season in Hertfordshire before joining Wolves in May.
"Wolves are a big club with a great history," said. "It's just mind-blowing what I'm going to be involved in here."
Harris arrives from the Middlesex-based Conquest Academy in London.
"He is a left-footed winger with considerable pace," said Wolves sporting director Kevin Thelwell. "He has been here on trial for two weeks, and impressed for the Under-18s against West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland."
