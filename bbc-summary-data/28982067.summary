The stamp was released on Thursday, and features a black and white photograph of the late Derry poet.
A special first-day cover envelope showed an extract from his 1969 poem, Bogland.
Mr Heaney's son said he was "immensely moved" that his father's life was being celebrated with a commemorative stamp.
Michael Heaney said: "The year since he died has been a sad time for our family, but this is not only a wonderful testament to his life and work, but also a reminder of the generosity and support people have shown since Dad's passing.
"We would like to express our deepest thanks and appreciation to everyone involved in bestowing this rare honour on the husband, father, grandfather and poet we miss so much."
Mr Heaney died in August 2013 at the age of 74 after suffering from ill health.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1995 "for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past".
He was acclaimed by many as the best Irish poet since Yeats.
