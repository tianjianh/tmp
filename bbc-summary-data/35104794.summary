November retail sales fall despite 'Black Friday'

High street sales fell last month despite the "Black Friday" bargains, according to the Scottish Retail Consortium.

Overall sales were down 2.3% on the same month a year ago, although food sales were up slightly once online purchases were factored in.
Internet shopping picked up towards the end of the month with electrical goods the main beneficiary.
Once adjusted for online shopping, non-food sales also grew but only by 0.4%.
The monthly retail sales monitor, compiled by KPMG for the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC), suggested consumers held back on purchases early in the month in the hope of getting "Black Friday" bargains.
The traditional heavy discounting by US firms on the first day after Thanksgiving has spread worldwide and last year prompted rowdy scenes at some stores.
This year, however, Black Friday was quieter with evidence that shoppers were turning to the internet for purchases.
SRC head of policy and external affairs David Martin said: "Learning the lessons from last year, consumers ducked the frenzy of the Black Friday bargain hunt on the high street and made more of their purchases online in November.
"As the lines between retail channels become increasingly blurred a disappointing set of headline store figures masks a positive non-food retail performance.
"The six month rolling average reached 0.7%, its highest level since November 2014, suggestive of non-food sales gathering momentum ahead of Christmas.
"Non-food sales were the main beneficiary of the Black Friday bounce and grew by 0.4% once adjusted for the effect of online sales."
Mr Martin added: "The evidence suggests that consumers held back their spending in the first few weeks of November in order to capitalise on the deals and offers during the final week of the month.
"Promotions stimulated sales in of cosmetic products and electrical items, as household get ready for Christmas, while consumers continued to spend on big ticket items like furniture.
"The Black Friday event disrupted sales patterns in November and only time will tell what true affect it has had on the build up to Christmas."
David McCorquodale, head of retail at KPMG, said it appeared consumers were still waiting for discounts before committing to spend.
Retailers would have to decide whether to cut prices or "hold their nerve", he said.
He added: ""Non-food sales, adjusted for the effect of online, grew by 0.4% during November, with mid-month demand being weak and uplift driven by significant activity around Black Friday.
"Most of the Black Friday activity focused on electricals and household appliances, with online channels proving most popular."
