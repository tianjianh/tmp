Carlin missed out on a place in the British team for London 2012 but has since won five titles and collected bronze at the 2015 World Championships.
The 25-year-old is happy with her form as she looks to qualify for the individual freestyle events in Brazil.
"I love racing more than ever now," Carlin told BBC Wales Sport.
"2015 was a good year and I was happy with how it went but obviously it's all about 2016 and hopefully qualifying for the Olympics."
Carlin won 800m freestyle gold and silver in the 400m freestyle at the 2014 Commonwealth Games before securing two gold medals at the European Short Course Championships.
The Bath-based swimmer missed out on the 2012 Olympics through illness and a resulting lack of form and is determined to qualify for Rio.
"Four years ago I was in a completely different position and I wasn't ready for the Olympic trials with illness. It really was a tough time," Carlin added.
"Four years on I can appreciate everything that I've been through and it's about making sure I stay fit and healthy.
"I've got a lot of fast competitors around but if I've done everything right and I've done everything I can do then that's all I can really ask of myself."
The Olympic trials will be held in Glasgow in April and Carlin believes Great Britain's swimming team in Rio will feature a healthy Welsh contingent.
Georgia Davies also won gold and silver at Glasgow 2014 while Calum Jarvis and Daniel Jervis secured bronze medals and Carlin is confident there will be an increase on the five Welsh swimmers who featured at London 2012.
"The Welsh team is getting stronger and stronger," Carlin said.
"There's quite a few I'd like to put my money on that would go [to Rio] and I'll be supporting all of them as we're a really close team.
"The Welsh swimmers can do great in Rio and I definitely think it will be a stepping stone leading into the next Commonwealth Games."
