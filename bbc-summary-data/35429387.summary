Terri the loggerhead turtle washed up in Jersey and needs to return to a warmer climate to be released.
She was treated for shell damage and signs of an infection, and vets started a campaign to send her home.
After calls on social media for money, Guernsey company Aeris Aviation offered Mr Dickinson's jet at a reduced cost.
The 57-year-old singer, famous for hits including Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter and Run To The Hills, is a qualified pilot, having learnt to fly in the 1990s.
Originally the plan was to send Terri by private jet at the cost of £22,000.
But now she will be able to take a much shorter flight - approximately five hours instead of the 12 originally quoted - and £6,000 raised in a public fundraising campaign will go towards the cost.
Mr Howarth said his colleagues were grateful for the support they had been given by people and businesses in Jersey.
He said: "A jet has become available at a far reduced price and with the donations at the hospital and online we have reached the price we need for the jet.
"It shows how much one little turtle can bond people together. We had interest immediately from Dubai, Australia and America.
"The sea life trust in the UK offered money if we need it, which we hope to put towards a satellite tracker so people can follow Terri on her journey."
