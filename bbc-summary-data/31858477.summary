Antrim firm Mivan has said it hopes to be back employing 250 people within two years - the same number of jobs lost when it went into administration in 2014.

The company was bought over by the MJM Group in Newry.
It has retained the name of the construction firm.
However, in the course of the past year it has focused the business on specialist joinery.
Today, Mivan employs 102 people, many of them staff who lost their jobs first time around.
"Mivan now has a healthy order book," said Brian McConville, chief executive of MJM Group.
"We are confident that in a very short space of time it will regain its place as one of the leading companies in the Northern Ireland construction sector."
MJM specialises in marine interiors and the fitting-out of cruise liners.
Its work overlapped with some of what Mivan did before the Antrim firm went under.
After Mivan could not be sold as a going concern, MJM stepped in to buy the factory and its assets.
It also retained the Mivan name.
Invest NI supported 28 of the jobs.
Speaking at an event at the factory, DUP Junior Minister Jonathan Bell said the "revitalisation of Mivan" was welcome news for the Northern Ireland economy.
