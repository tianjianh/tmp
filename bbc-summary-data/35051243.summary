A "predatory" paedophile who raped and sexually assaulted five young girls over 10 years after befriending their mothers has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Luis Moreno, 66, of Aquarius Street, Hulme, was found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of nine counts of rape and 11 counts of indecent assault.
On Wednesday he was jailed for 16 years.
The court heard the abuse started in 1994, when the first victim was eight years old, police said.
Moreno targeted five young girls at his house in Hulme for the next 10 years, the youngest being aged seven when the abuse started.
Having befriended the mothers of several of the victims, Moreno would encourage the girls to come round to his house to watch television and DVDs.
While they were at the house, he would systematically abuse and rape the girls, sometimes while others were waiting outside the door, police said.
The court heard one of the victims say she had been raped 40 times a year.
Det Con Mark Watson said: "Moreno is a predatory paedophile with the singular motive of luring those girls round to his house.
"Once there, he would systematically abuse them on a weekly basis, always in the same way and often while other girls were in the house, sometimes he would also film his abuse.
"The catalogue of his abuse is sickening and his charge sheet is one of the largest I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with."
