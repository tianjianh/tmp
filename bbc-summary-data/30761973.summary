[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police are appealing for information following the report of a distraction burglary and other suspicious activity.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
An elderly man was robbed after a man called to his property on the Drumanphy Road, Portadown, inquiring about replacing electricity poles on Friday.
He went outside and when he came back in, two men were inside his home and ran out the front door.
Earlier, two men called at a pensioner's house at Millview Park, Richhill, to check her cooker.
They went into the house, looked at the cooker and then left.  It is not believed that anything was stolen.
The incident happened between 13:00 GMT and 14:00 GMT.
Then, police received a report that shortly before 16:00 GMT on Friday that a man in the Cloveneden Road area of Loughgall had observed three men acting suspiciously at the back of his home. They were in a silver car.
When challenged by the householder, he was told that they were "looking for someone".  The caller felt that their actions were suspicious.
Detective Inspector Keith Gawley has appealed for information about all three incidents.
"You should remember that any genuine caller to your door will have identification which you have every right to ask for and verify," he said.
"Beware of callers who attempt to distract you by claiming that they have seen something untoward in your rear garden or somewhere that may encourage you to leave your house - they may have an accomplice who is waiting to act upon this distraction.
"If you are not convinced of the identity of the caller, don't let them in.
"Ask the caller to come back later and arrange for a friend, relative or neighbour to be present on their return.
"Neighbours can also play a part in helping protect the more vulnerable in their community."
