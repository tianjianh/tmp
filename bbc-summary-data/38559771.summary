New Dumfries hospital project exceeds jobs goals

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said that construction of a new Dumfries hospital has exceeded its initial job creation estimates.

She was speaking during a visit to the site of the multi-million pound project which is due to be completed this year.
The scheme has resulted in 215 new jobs in Dumfries and Galloway - 55 more than originally planned.
Ms Sturgeon said the project was "delivering a meaningful community benefit" and aiding the economy.
"With a full year's work ahead of us until the hospital is complete, we fully intend to make the most of the opportunities this presents to the community, as well as to individuals seeking training or work opportunities," she said.
"This new facility will deliver high-quality health services to patients from the Dumfries and Galloway region, and we are investing in the latest technologies to ensure efficient and effective diagnostics and treatment for every patient."
NHS Dumfries and Galloway chief executive Jeff Ace said the health board was delighted that High Wood Health and construction partner Laing O'Rourke remained on schedule with the works.
"This is a very exciting time for all involved in the new hospital project as we move closer to seeing our vision for a fantastic new facility for our patients and staff become a reality," he said.
"The new hospital project has delivered all anticipated community benefits in terms of new jobs, apprenticeships and training opportunities and we will continue to maximise these gains over the coming year.
"By the time the new hospital is handed over in September 2017 many local people will have made a significant contribution to the construction programme remaining on schedule, and will have gained valuable experience working on an exciting new build project."
South of Scotland Labour MSP Colin Smyth said no amount of "hurriedly arranged photocalls" would cover up the fact that the NHS was "facing crisis".
"NHS Dumfries and Galloway recently confirmed that they need to make Â£20m of cuts alone next year, because government funding is not keeping up with demand," he said.
"We have a GP crisis in the region, with GP practices closing and merging because doctors posts can't be filled and last year 300 operations were cancelled in the region alone because we don't have enough capacity due to the shortage of consultants.
"A new building, welcome as that is, won't change the fact that it is nurses, doctors, consultants and auxiliary staff that carry out the care and the first minister needs to start listening to NHS staff who are telling the government there aren't enough of them to do their job."
The new hospital received Â£200m from the Scottish government's non-profit distributing (NPD) programme.
It is expected to open in December this year.
