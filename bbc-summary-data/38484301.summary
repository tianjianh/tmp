The 33-year-old, who was captain at Leyton Orient when new Coventry boss Russell Slade was in charge at Brisbane Road, has agreed a deal until the end of the season on a free transfer.
Clarke spent 11 years at Huddersfield, playing more than 300 times for the club, before moving to Orient in 2012.
"He will bring assurance and knowhow, as well as have a positive impact on the younger players," Slade said.
Clarke is one of three players to join struggling Coventry as the January transfer window opens.
Striker Stuart Beavon and midfielder Callum Reilly have moved to the Ricoh Arena from Burton Albion, with forward Marvin Sordell moving in the opposite direction.
