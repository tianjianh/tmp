Tim Murtagh: Ireland bowler returns for England ODI match

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ireland have recalled bowler Tim Murtagh to their squad for next month's ODI against England at Malahide.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murtagh missed the World Cup because of a foot injury but has recovered and is named in the 14-man squad.
The rest of the squad featured in the World Cup while Peter Chase and Max Sorensen are the players left out.
It will be a special occasion for captain William Porterfield, who will make his 200th Ireland appearance in the 8 May match near Dublin.
"It's a great honour for me to have played 200 times for my country," said Porterfield, who made his debut against Namibia in 2006.
It will be Porterfield's 80th ODI with Ireland, and he will be hoping to add to his tally of seven centuries, the most by an Irish batsman.
"It's a bit special for it to be against England in front of an expected sell-out crowd at Malahide," added the 30-year-old.
"I've happy memories personally from the last time we played them in Dublin, scoring a century, although the result didn't go our way.
"Hopefully in home conditions we can get the win that our fantastic supporters so richly deserve."
Ireland still hope to have a new coach in place for the game, with the process to replace Phil Simmons, who left to take charge of West Indies last month, continuing.
Ireland squad:
William Porterfield (captain), (Warwickshire), Andrew Balbirnie (Middlesex), Alex Cusack (Clontarf), George Dockrell (Somerset), Ed Joyce (Sussex), Andrew McBrine (Donemana), John Mooney (North County), Tim Murtagh (Middlesex), Kevin O'Brien (Railway Union), Niall O'Brien (Leicestershire), Paul Stirling (Middlesex), Stuart Thompson (Eglinton), Gary Wilson (Surrey), Craig Young (Bready).
