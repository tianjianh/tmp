A Derry family have been targeted in a sectarian attack by a gang of youths.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
On Monday, a 19-year-old man in the Waterside area of the city was chased by a gang of youths who shouted anti-Catholic abuse and threw bottles and stones.
A window was also smashed in the family's bedroom where a 3-year-old boy lay sleeping.
Police said they are treating the attack as a sectarian hate crime.
The teenage son, who didn't want to be named, said he was returning home with a friend when it happened.
"We were literally just halfway up the street and there's a few boys across the street shouting and two seconds later we got a couple of stones and glass bottles thrown at us.
"He ran one way and I ran the other. There was roughly about 10 or 12 of them.
His mother said her son was in shock when he came home.
"He was shaken up, scared like," she said.
"He was only in the door two seconds when we heard a bang on the window."
"They smashed the bedroom window where me and my 3-year-old son both sleep and he was in bed at the time.
"It only smashed the outside pane of the double glazing but if it had been a bigger stone or thrown with more force it could have hit him in his bed while he was sleeping.
"They have no thought for anybody and it was a completely unprovoked attack."
Police are appealing for witnesses who were in vicinity of Dungiven Road, Glendermott Road, Bentley Terrace or Meehans Terrace at around 00:30 GMT who can help identify those involved in this incident.
