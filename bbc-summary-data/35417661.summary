[SN]TITLE[SN]
Powys secondary schools reorganisation plans discussed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to overhaul secondary schools in Powys will be discussed next month.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The council will look at proposals to build a new English-medium school to replace those in Gwernyfed and Brecon.
It also recommended a new school be built in Builth Wells, replacing the town's existing high school and the one in Llandrindod Wells.
If approved, it is hoped the plans will cut costs and tackle the issue of surplus places.
