Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team said a woman and her three teenage sons found the body of a man on Tryfan on Thursday at about 16:00 BST.
The man, thought to be in his 20s or 30s, is from the north west of England.
Rescuers believe the man fell 20 or 30m (65ft-100ft) while trying to descend a gully on Heather Terrace, which cannot be walked down because of two large rock steps towards the bottom.
"It is probable that the casualty descended to one of the steps and tried to find a way round to the side but slipped to his death," a mountain rescue team spokesman said.
"Our thanks go to the family group for staying with the casualty and our thoughts are with the casualty's relatives."
