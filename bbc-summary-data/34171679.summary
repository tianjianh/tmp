Record crowds packed into the stands of Worthing United football club to watch a match dedicated to two of its players who died in the Shoreham air crash.

Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt were among the 11 who died on 22 August.
The club normally plays in front of about 100 people, but more than a thousand tickets were sold for Sunday's FA Vase match against East Preston.
Manager Nigel Geary said people wanted to pay their respects.
He said not everyone could attend the funerals and people wanted to come to the match and show their support.
Vice-chairman Mark Sanderson said it had been a remarkable day and the club had never seen anything like it.
Memorial scarves were printed with the names of the two players, and 2,500 programmes were produced.
Proceeds are being used to pay for a permanent tribute to the players, who were travelling together to a game when a vintage jet crashed on to the A27 in West Sussex.
An initial report into the Shoreham air show disaster said the Hawker Hunter jet showed "no abnormal indications" during its flight.
Andy Hill, the 51-year-old pilot, remains in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
