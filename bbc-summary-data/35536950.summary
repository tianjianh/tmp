Premiership: Saracens v Wasps (Sun)

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saracens have club captain Alistair Hargreaves back in their starting line-up for the first time in three months for the visit of Wasps to Allianz Park.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scrum-half Ben Spencer rotates with Richard Wigglesworth for his seventh Premiership appearance of the season.
Wasps have Elliot Daly back at centre after his release from England duty.
New signing Siale Piutau starts next to him, allowing the Tonga international to play for the first time alongside his brother, All Black Charles.
But Wasps have lost lock forward James Gaskell, who now needs surgery on a foot injury sustained in a narrow home win over Newcastle, which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the season.
After three successive Premiership wins, Wasps are looking to make it four in a row for the first time since the 2012-13 season.
But they are up against the reigning champions, who start the day 17 points better off than Wasps, having lost just once in 11 league games this season.
Saracens have also won their last nine meetings with Wasps since losing 20-15 in the annual Double Header at Twickenham in 2011.
Wasps will be making only their second trip to Allianz Park, where they lost 19-12 on their last visit in October 2013.
Wasps director of rugby Dai Young:
"We just got over the line last weekend against Newcastle and know we will need to up our game.
"Saracens are the form team, not only in England but also in Europe. They are really accurate and efficient in everything they do and excel at pressurising the opposition into making mistakes.
"It's essential to match their accuracy and minimise errors. It doesn't come any harder than playing at the home of the Premiership champions, but we know on our day we can compete with the very best."
