Brentford sacked Marinus Dijkuizen in September, with Lee Carsley put in charge of the Championship club until the end of the season.
Despite overseeing an improvement in results, Carsley has said he does not want the job on a full-time basis.
The Bees have not yet made an official approach for Clotet, but the Spaniard is believed to be on their shortlist.
Clotet, 38, joined Swansea's academy in 2013 and was promoted to assist manager Garry Monk when Michael Laudrup was sacked in February 2014.
Brentford, who are 11th in the Championship, are searching for a permanent manager following Dijkhuizen's swift departure.
The Dutchman was only in charge for nine matches, having been appointed in June after the controversial departure of previous boss Mark Warburton.
Carsley won four games in a row in October after starting his reign with two defeats.
