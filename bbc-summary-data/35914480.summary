One of the first numbers out showed Japan's jobless rate rose slightly to 3.3% in February, up from 3.2% in January, despite labour demand remaining at the highest level in two decades.
The unemployment rate had been expected to remain unchanged at 3.2%.
The Nikkei later recovered slightly to be down 0.4% to 17,074.77 points.
Analysts said Japan could see a fall in the jobless rate in the coming months.
"[Japan's] job-to-applicant suggests that the unemployment rate could fall below 3% in coming months even though the ratio held steady at 1.28 last month," said economist Marcel Thieliant.
Other official numbers released on Tuesday showed that household spending rose 1.2% in February compared with the same month last year, against expectations for a decline of 1.5%.
Retail sales rose 0.5% in February against expectations for a year on  year rise of 1.7%
