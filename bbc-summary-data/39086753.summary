The Sandgrounders flew into an early lead when Ben McKenna crept in to head home Neil Ashton's good ball.
However, Joe Pigott lofted in a pass for his strike partner Loza to control and convert.
The home side led at the break when Ryan Higgins tripped Loza in the box and he got up to score from the penalty spot.
In the second half, Jamie Allen briefly volleyed the visitors level, but Loza set up Pigott neatly to restore Maidstone's lead.
Kevin Lokko then added a fourth as Southport sunk to the bottom of the table.
