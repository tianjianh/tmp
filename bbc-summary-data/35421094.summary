House building in Northern Ireland last year hit its highest level since 2009, according to industry figures.

New home registrations rose by 30% to 3,223, the National House Building Council (NHBC) said.
That increase comes off a very low base - the number of new houses fell rapidly during the property crash reaching a low point of fewer than 2,000 in 2012.
In comparison, more than 7,000 new house were built in 2007.
Separately, official figures show that Northern Ireland has lost more than one in four of its construction businesses since 2009.
The inter-departmental business register shows that between 2009 and 2015 the number of construction businesses fell by 3,295.
That was a decline of almost 27%.
In comparison, the IT sector saw a growth of 21% in that period.
