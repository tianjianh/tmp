The singer's third record, released last Friday, shot to the top of the charts with a whopping 672,000 sales and streams in its opening week - more than the rest of the Official Charts Company's top 500 albums combined.
Sheeran also broke records in the singles charts, with Shape Of You number one for the ninth straight week, ahead of Galway Girl, Castle On The Hill, Perfect and New Man - the first time an artist has ever held the top five spots.
