The Rainbow Laces campaign aims to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic attitudes in sport.
Rainbow flags will feature at Premier League fixtures, while referees will wear rainbow-coloured laces.
Top-level rugby union game in England and Wales will also back the campaign.
Wembley Arch will be lit up in rainbow colours on Saturday.
"The Premier League is all about exciting, passionate and unpredictable football that is for everyone, everywhere," Premier League executive chairman Richard Scudamore said.
"The Rainbow Laces campaign complements the work clubs are doing to promote inclusion and diversity in their stadiums, and across all levels of the sport."
The Rainbow Laces campaign was launched by LGBT equality charity Stonewall in 2013.
Ian Ritchie, chief executive of the RFU, said: "The Rugby Football Union is proud to support Stonewall and the Rainbow Laces campaign.
"We believe rugby's core values of respect, teamwork and sportsmanship resonate with what is at the heart of this important campaign."
