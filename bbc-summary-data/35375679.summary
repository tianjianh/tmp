[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Djilobodji, 27, moved to Stamford Bridge from Nantes in a Â£4m deal on transfer deadline day in September.
However, he has made just one appearance since then - as a late substitute in a League Cup win over Walsall.
The Senegal international, who started his career at Senart-Moissy, is contracted to Chelsea until 2019.
Bremen are third bottom of the Bundesliga - the relegation play-off place - two points off bottom spot.
