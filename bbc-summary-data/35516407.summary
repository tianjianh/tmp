The Met Office has warned of gusts of up to 80mph in coastal areas.
Highways England said there was an increased risk of lorries, caravans and motorbikes "being blown over".
The weather has already led to some ferry disruption. Some Friday evening services have been cancelled and other services will not run on Monday.
Highways England has urged drivers of lorries, vehicles towing caravans and motorcyclists to "take extra care" and delay their journeys if the "weather becomes severe".
A spokesman said if the wind speed went above the threshold for the Severn crossings and QEII Bridge at Dartford they would have to introduce speed restrictions or shut them temporarily.
"We are keeping a close eye on the situation. There is a greater likelihood that there may be restrictions on the Severn crossing."
The Commodore Goodwill 18:30 GMT Portsmouth to Guernsey crossing and DFDS Seaways 23:30 Newhaven to Dieppe service have both been cancelled.
Sea conditions also meant one of the operator's Dover to Calais ferries was delayed earlier on Sunday. Storm Imogen warning halts ferries

A yellow warning of rain is already in place for Devon, Torbay, Somerset, north Somerset and Plymouth.
There are 35 flood warnings in place in England, including five on the River Avon in Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, indicating that flooding is expected and "immediate action is required".
Fifteen racehorses had to be rescued from a champion trainer's yard in Ditcheat, Somerset, overnight after flash floods hit their stables.
Large waves are also expected to cause flooding to coastal properties in several locations in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset.
Forecaster Craig Snell said: "We have issued a broad yellow warning of wind that encompasses Cardiff, Bristol and into the Thames Estuary.
"There is an amber warning for wind mainly focused on Devon and Cornwall but stretching into central England on Monday morning.
"This means people should be prepared for disruption to travel on roads, rail, bridges and ferries and we could see possible damage to structures and downed trees risk affecting power.
"The wind will be combined with some hefty showers with some thunder along the south coast."
