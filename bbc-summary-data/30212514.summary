'Fed up' drink-driver Murray Geddes killed friend in crash

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drink-driver who got behind the wheel because he was "fed up waiting for a taxi" crashed and killed his friend, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Murray Geddes, 37, from Aberlour in Moray, admitted causing the death of passenger Graeme McKenzie, also 37, by driving dangerously on the A941 Craigellachie to Rothes road in May.
Mr McKenzie, an offshore worker from Rothes, was thrown from the vehicle.
Sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh was deferred.
The court heard offshore driller Geddes had a speeding conviction from March for driving at 93mph in a 60mph zone on the A96 near Huntly.
Geddes told police after the fatal crash that he had taken his Audi S3 from the pub because he was fed up waiting for a taxi.
Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC said: "The accused and the deceased were close friends who grew up together in the Speyside area."
A motorist who was overtaken by Geddes later said: "I would say it was like a speed demon."
The prosecutor said a witness saw the car fail to negotiate a bend and leave the road, it became airborne and spun three times.
Mr Brown told Lord Glennie: "The death of Graeme McKenzie has of course had a profound impact on his family."
The judge deferred sentence on Geddes for the preparation of a background report and he was remanded in custody.
