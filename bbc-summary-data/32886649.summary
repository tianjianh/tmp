Casement Park Q&A;: What's the state of play?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The redevelopment of a Belfast sports stadium has been engulfed in controversy after warnings of safety concerns.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is planning to build a 38,000-capacity stadium at its existing west Belfast sports ground, Casement Park.
A whistleblower, safety expert Paul Scott, claimed he was bullied when he raised concerns that the stadium could not be evacuated safely in emergencies.
BBC News NI looks at the main players involved in the stalled sports project.
There are three separate investigations:
He is an expert in ground and crowd safety working at Sport NI. He chairs safety technical groups (STGs) including one on Casement Park. He said there were questions about emergency exits. Mr Scott said warnings had been sounded early in the process. However, the minister said she was shocked to hear them on 30 April when he addressed the CAL committee.
The safety concerns had been outlined in a BBC Newsline report following a Freedom of Information request in November.
Mr Scott was then called to speak to the committee at Stormont. He told them that he had been put under "undue pressure" to approve plans for the new ground by officials from the minister's department.
He also said he had made a complaint of bullying against them.
Mr Scott said he had been told that he was to be replaced.  However, the department and the minister said that he remains chair of the STG.
A draft discussion document proposing that someone from DCAL should lead the safety group was sent to Mr Scott the day before he appeared at Stormont.
A Department spokesperson said the latest discussions around terms of reference for the safety technical group (STG)started last December and that these were drafted by DCAL with input from Sport NI.
A spokesperson said the minister had commissioned an independent review and it would be "inappropriate to comment further ahead of the outcome". The STG is likely to meet soon. It is understood Mr Scott will be in the chair.
It continues. Gaelic Athletic Association officials will probably appear before the CAL committee. They have already denied any involvement in bullying or that they would in any way jeopardise crowd safety.
It is likely the design team will be considering the concerns raised by Mr Scott. The minister said she would be surprised if new proposals for the stadium do not include a reduced capacity.
The GAA had wanted a 38,000-seater venue - the largest stadium in Northern Ireland. Some residents living close to the park objected to the scale of the project.
Not all residents are opposed to the development but there have been local objections to the scale of the project. One group said 18,000 would be the maximum they would accept.
No. The GAA's goal is to have a stadium capable of holding big championship games with up to 38,000 seats. St Tiernach's Park in Clones already has a capacity of around 36,000 so it is difficult to see how the GAA could justify holding a championship final in any Ulster ground that sells significantly fewer tickets.
Emergency exiting concerns at Casement centre on the fact that most spectators leave the ground towards the Andersonstown Road in west Belfast. The question posed by STG members was what happens if the road is closed or blocked as a crowd tries to leave?
The GAA is confident it has a top design team who will have the answer.
The minister said safety has been a top priority throughout the process..
Almost £7m has already been spent and MLAs want assurances that money has not been wasted.
In February, DCAL told the BBC: "The planning application cost approximately £82,000, with the process of appointing a contractor being approximately £295,000".
Questions also remain about how Mr Scott was treated as well as DCAL and Sport NI procedures.
Those carrying out the various investigations have some busy months ahead.
