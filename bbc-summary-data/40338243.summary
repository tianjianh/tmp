Concerns were raised over leadership, patients being treated in corridors and a shortage of consultants.
The trust is already in special measures and must remain so for a further three to six months, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said.
The trust said it accepted the findings and that a new leadership team was "determined to put things right".
The trust, which was placed in special measures in December 2015, runs Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Kidderminster Hospital and Treatment Centre and Alexandra Hospital, Redditch.

Inspectors said there had been "little evidence of improvement" adding, "rather than getting better, our latest inspection shows a noticeable decline in ratings".
However, it said generally, staff were hard-working, passionate and caring and because of that the trust was rated as good for caring.
The trust's chief executive, Michelle McKay, said: "We are working hard to make the necessary improvements to make our services consistently better and safer and ensure that quality improvement is part of our daily business."
Improvements had been made since the inspection, she said.
The trust was told to make significant improvements around staffing and governance in January and the result of further inspections around those issues is due in July, the CQC said.
