Sarah Cawthorne, 32, from Sedgeley, who ran Dudley-based firm A Little Bit of Bling, was sentenced to 12 months at Wolverhampton Crown Court on Thursday, after she admitted fraudulent trading in March.
In all, Cawthorne defrauded more than 100 brides out of at least £30,000, spending much of it on gambling websites, as well as a trip to Disneyland, the court heard.
"You get carried away, you just want it to be the perfect day and we were just so worked up," said Sarah Broadley, one of several brides to be let down by Cawthorne at the last minute.
"I'd tried calling her, messaging her on Facebook and eventually got a message saying she wouldn't be coming. That was 11:30am and we were getting married at 4pm."
Luckily, the wedding venue stepped in to help with the chair covers, table decorations and other touches bought from A Little Bit of Bling.
Mrs Broadley, from Dudley, lost £180, but many couples lost more.
Jade Caddick, from Birmingham, lost more than £1,000 when she paid Cawthorne to provide chair covers, sashes and table runners, among other items.
"I got to the hotel the day before and she'd not turned up. Even on the day itself I was getting ready, sitting in my wedding dress and trying to get hold of Sarah," she said.
"Other brides were also phoning me up. I think I only turned my phone off 45 minutes before the wedding.
"On my honeymoon I was being contacted by hundreds of strangers panicking about their weddings.
"The whole thing caused rows with my husband and affected my little boy.
"Today justice has prevailed."
Just as Facebook had promoted Cawthorne's business, dozens of couples took to the social media site to vent their anger after being let down - setting up a group called Burned Brides to compare experiences.
Dudley Trading Standards, which brought the prosecution, said it had received more than 70 complaints from across the country.
Kamy Poultney, from Cornwall, said she later found out her's was one of four weddings Cawthorne had promised to provide decorations for on 21 June 2014.
"I couldn't look forward to my wedding. It was the stress of it all, first trying to find out what was going on and then chasing up my money," she said.
"I went to the police, I reported it to Action Fraud and then launched a case in the small claims court."
Cawthorne insisted on being paid up front, almost immediately, but many brides thought the deals on offer were worth the outlay.
Louise Bruce, from Rotherham, said she had been on holiday at the time and asked her parents-in-law to transfer the money to Cawthorne's company.
"Later I saw a few complaints online and tried to get in touch with Sarah. She said she'd been unwell and had had a breakdown, but told me everything would be ok.
"I found out the next few days she'd gone bankrupt.
"Luckily I found out in good time.
"I'd written off the £319 a long time ago, I never thought we'd get justice.
"We celebrated our first anniversary on the day she [Cawthorne] pleaded guilty. It made our day."
