Belfast power station: Evermore Energy plans gas-fired facility

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An energy company is planning to build a gas-fired power station in Belfast with the capacity to produce electricity for over 400,000 homes.

Evermore Energy aims to develop the 400-megawatt facility at a site on the Belfast Harbour Estate.
The company has previously developed a smaller biomass-fuelled power plant at Londonderry Port.
A planning application is due to be lodged later this year.
Funding for the scheme is understood to be well advanced.
Two of Northern Ireland's major existing power stations will have to reduce their capacity in coming years to comply with pollution rules.
Some of the older generating units at Ballylumford, near Larne in County Antrim, have reached the end of their acceptable service.
Similarly, Kilroot power station, near Carrickfergus, County Antrim, will face emissions constraints which reduce its capacity from 2021.
Kilroot is fuelled by coal and oil while Ballylumford uses a combination of gas and oil.
The new plant will use the latest Siemens gas-fired technology and will produce roughly a similar amount of power as the Coolkeeragh power station in Derry.
A power station operated on the Belfast Harbour Estate from 1961 to 2002.
