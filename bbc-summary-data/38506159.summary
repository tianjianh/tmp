The rare Red Poll cows have been brought from Cheshire to help out on Ainsdale sand dunes in Merseyside to break up the tough shrubs that are threatening to ruin the dunes for other wildlife.
The sandy dunes are supposed to be open so small animals, bird and insects can move around easily - but the rough grasses and bushes can block their paths.
Red Poll cows are well known for eating as many different kinds of plants as they can get their teeth around!
Once they finish here, the cows will be heading to another nature reserve to continue their hard work of eating!
