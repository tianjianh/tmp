Ethan Ampadu: 'He's not missing school for Wales camp' - Exeter City boss Paul Tisdale

Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale says youngster Ethan Ampadu has only been able to link up with Wales squad because of school half-term.

Ampadu, 16, who is sitting his GCSE exams, has been included in the squad for the training camp in Portugal.
"He's not missing any school but his priority at the moment is his exams," Tisdale said.
"He probably couldn't go away with Wales unless it happened to coincide with half-term week, which it does."
Ampadu has represented Wales up to Under-19 level, but is also eligible for England, the Republic of Ireland and Ghana.
Tisdale described the defensive player as a "remarkably gifted but grounded young man".
The Exeter-born teenager made his professional debut for the Grecians in August 2016 and was named Wales' young player of the year in November.

He did not feature in the League Two play-offs, including Sunday's final defeat against Blackpool, with Tisdale saying his exams took priority.
"He's got a long career ahead of him and I think he'll do very well for himself," Tisdale added.
"He's played some really good games for us this year and is one of our better players.
"But it's very hard for a young chap at that age to play this level of football when he's at school every day, especially play-off games.
"The Welsh training squad has come at a very good time for him.
"He's a grounded young man and I don't think he'll change his attitude one little bit.
"He wants to do very well for himself and I'm sure he will."
