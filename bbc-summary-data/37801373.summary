They have been announced as hosts of a new Saturday night BBC One show, Let's Sing and Dance For Comic Relief.
The pair quit the Bake Off in September after it was announced the show would be moving to Channel 4.
Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief, described as "a singing and dancing extravaganza", will be on BBC One next year ahead of Red Nose Day 2017.
Perkins said she was "thrilled" to be co-presenting the show, "not least because it will finally show the world why I was voted West Penwith's Krumping Champion (over 40s category)."
Giedroyc issued her own statement, which said: "Since leaving the Royal Ballet twelve years ago, Mel is really looking forward to getting back on her points and showing the brave Comic Relief celebrity dancers how to split leap and ball change.
"She's delighted to be taking time out from her busy schedule at the Royal Opera House (she was recently called 'a complete and utter Tosca' in the starring role of the eponymous opera) to take part in co-hosting duties for Let's Sing and Dance For Comic Relief."
Let's Dance for Comic Relief has been a hit TV show with fans in the past.
The new format will see celebrity contestants, who are yet to be announced, singing as well as performing iconic dance routines of classic songs.
They will perform in front of a panel of guest judges. The four-episode series will include three live heats before a live grand finale.
Giedroyc and Perkins will also be sent out onto the street to get the public involved in dance-offs.
Kate Phillips, controller of BBC entertainment commissioning, said it was "hugely exciting" to bring the pair to BBC One on a Saturday night.
She said: "Their warmth, wit, charm and chemistry married with their genuine love of entertainment are all a perfect fit for Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief."
When they announced they were leaving The Great British Bake Off, Giedroyc and Perkins said they were "very shocked and saddened" to learn that Channel 4 had bought the show.
They had been with the programme since it started in 2010 and were a massive hit with fans for their gentle humour and double entendres.
Giedroyc and Perkins, who did not enter into talks with Channel 4, explained in a statement: "We made no secret of our desire for the show to remain where it was... we're not going with the dough."
Mary Berry also said she would not be moving with only fellow judge Paul Hollywood to appear on the show on its new channel.
Great British Bake Off's final episode on the BBC was broadcast on Wednesday, reaching a record audience.
The BBC is hoping the new Comic Relief contest will become an international format, like other shows such as Strictly Come Dancing.
Nicki McDermott from BBC Worldwide is overseeing the international sale of the show format.
She said: "We've already seen how internationally appealing dancing has been, so we're confident that the multi-tasking opportunities and pitfalls that singing adds to the mix will see many other countries wanting to emulate the entertainment values this series affords viewers everywhere."
