[SN]TITLE[SN]
Flooding relief scheme: Farms and small businesses now eligible

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The executive has agreed to set aside Â£200,000 to help farmers and businesses affected by the winter floods.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The proposal was agreed at an executive meeting on Thursday morning.
It will mean non-domestic properties affected by the flooding will be eligible for a one-off Â£1,000 payment. It will be paid through local councils.
As well as farms and small businesses, sports facilities, community halls and churches will also be eligible.
A similar scheme is already available for homeowners.
The Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was a "welcome addition" to a package of measures designed to help people affected by the storms.
Only small businesses employing fewer than 25 people can apply.
The business must have been out of use for a fortnight and show a non-insurable loss of at least Â£1,000.
Farm businesses will include farmyards and land.
Farmland must have been under water for a fortnight and incurred extra cost due to loss of productivity or unplanned reseeding.
