Redding, 21, spent three years with Marc VDS at Moto2 level before making the step up to MotoGP with Gresini Honda this season.
He will switch from 'Open' to a 'Factory' Honda with Marc VDS for 2015.
"We have shown quite clearly we are there to race and there to win," said VDS president Marc van der Straten.
Redding will see out the remaining races of this year's MotoGP season with his current team.
His best finish this season was seventh in opening race in Qatar.
