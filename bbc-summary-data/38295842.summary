Scarlets flanker James Davies has apologised for his "unforgiveable actions" in their European Champions Cup defeat at Toulon on Sunday.

The 2016 Rio Olympics GB Sevens silver medallist appeared to use a gesture and swear at referee Greg Garner.
Scarlets have condemned Davies' "abusive language or actions".
In a statement, the player said: "I would like to apologise to my team-mates, the fans, the Scarlets, my family and the rugby community."
In the 28th minute at Stade Felix Mayol, Garner called over Davies and Scarlets captain Ken Owens and told Davies: "If you use that language again on the pitch, I'll send you off."
Davies said he had apologised to English official Garner during and after the game.
He added: "During the heat of battle I lost my composure and said and did things I deeply regret.
"I apologised to referee Mr Garner both during and after the game but would like to reiterate my sincerest apologies publically."
A Scarlets spokesperson said: "The Scarlets hold the unique values of rugby union in the highest regard.
"Our players are all aware of their responsibility as role models and custodians of those values.
"We unreservedly condemn any foul or abusive language or actions like those displayed by James Davies on Sunday."
Davies could now face disciplinary action that could affect his chances of facing Toulon in their rematch at Parc y Scarlets, Llanelli on Sunday.
Scarlets say they will comply fully with "disciplinary procedures" and conduct an internal investigation into the incident.
