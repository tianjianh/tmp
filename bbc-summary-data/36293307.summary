The constable gave the 44-year-old first aid before paramedics arrived but the rider died at the scene.
He was found in St Chad's Queensway, Birmingham, close to the junction of Whittall Street at about 06:00 BST.
CCTV footage is being reviewed to assess how the crash happened, involving a man from Handsworth.  His relatives have been informed.
Pc Chris Ridge said: "Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man.
"We're working hard to establish the cause of the crash and need people's help.
"There is some suggestion that a second motorbike was travelling in convoy with the deceased's bike.
"While we check CCTV footage to see if that's the case, I'd ask that anyone who was in the area at the time to pick up the phone and tell us what they saw."
