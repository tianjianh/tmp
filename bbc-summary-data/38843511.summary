Ben Robinson: Burton Albion chairman 'disappointed' by home attendances

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Chairman Ben Robinson says he has been "disappointed" by the turnout from Burton Albion supporters for their home matches this season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Albion average 4,925 from 14 home league matches so far in 2016-17.
The figure means the Brewers have the lowest crowds in the Championship.
Robinson told BBC Radio Derby: "Week in and week out, we should be getting a lot more support considering we are playing in the Championship for the first time in the club's history."
Burton averaged 4,089 spectators per home match in winning promotion from League One last season.
Their largest home attendance this term was 6,746 against Derby County last August, a ground record and not far short of the Pirelli Stadium's 6,912 capacity
Nigel Clough's side are one place and three points above the relegation zone, and Robinson says it would be a wonderful achievement to stay in the division given their budget.
But he feels they need more backing from supporters to help them compete, adding: "That has been the big disappointment for me - the lack of support from the town.
"So come on you Burton fans, get behind us and let's see more of you down here."
