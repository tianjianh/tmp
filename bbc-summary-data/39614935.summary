[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Easter Rising has been commemorated with a military ceremony in Dublin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The event, which marked the 101st anniversary of the rebellion, was led by President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Enda Kenny.
Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader, Michelle O'Neill, also attended.
It was held outside the General Post Office (GPO) on O'Connell Street, the building that served as the headquarters of the 1916 rebels.
The 1916 rebellion was an attempt to overthrow British rule in Ireland.
President Higgins laid a wreath at the GPO and members of the Irish Defence Forces personnel also took part.
The state ceremony began with the lowering of the Irish tricolour.
A prayer was read and a piper played a lament before the Proclamation of Independence was read by an officer from the Irish defence forces.
