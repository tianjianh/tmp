The crash happened on the southbound carriageway between junction 3a and Corley Services just before 11:15 GMT on Saturday, police said.
The man, in his 50s and from Birmingham, was declared dead at the scene.
PC Stephen Barr said police wanted to speak to anyone who saw the crash or the man's grey Mini Cooper "in the minutes leading up to the collision".
"I'd like to thank people for their patience while the road was closed and also the other emergency services for their help at the scene," he said.
