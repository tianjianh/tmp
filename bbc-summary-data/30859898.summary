Tyler Oakley adds subtitles after vlogger campaign

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tyler Oakley has closed captioned (cc) all his YouTube videos - meaning his posts have the option to be subtitled.

In his latest post the vlogger said: "I want to make my little community here on YouTube more inclusive."
His decision was inspired by YouTuber Rikki Poynter, who is hard of hearing and campaigns for producers to make their work more accessible.
"I don't want this to feel like a place where only certain people can come," said Tyler.
"The fact that now millions, and millions and millions more people can enjoy my content is a cool thing."
In his post called Hear Me Out, Tyler, who has more than six million subscribers to his channel, went on to explain how other vloggers can closed caption their videos.
"I just want everyone to enjoy YouTube the way I enjoy YouTube," he said.
As #HearMeOut trended worldwide Tyler tweeted: "Thank you for being a part of this, I hope it completely changes YouTube's community."
In Rikki Poynter's original video asking for help to raise awareness for closed captioning on YouTube she pointed out that there are others who could benefit.
She said: "[This is] Not only for the deaf or hard of hearing, but for people who are learning English, those with auditory processing disorder and simply just people who prefer to read instead of listen."
Following Oakley's video Rikki told Newsbeat "Tyler giving me a shout out was pretty awesome and very much appreciated" but suggested his video could have included a little more encouragement for others to do the same thing.
"The only thing I would say could have been an improvement is instead of just emphasizing on the fact that people who are deaf/hard of hearing can understand what he's saying in his videos, he could've also emphasized that all YouTubers should CC their content and then those deaf/hard of hearing can watch theirs as well.
"Of course, regardless, other people have been CCing their videos but I, and somebody else who mentioned it to me, think it would've had a touch more impact if there was a little more emphasis on saying that all YouTubers should do this.
"It's going to help the #WithCaptions campaign and just CCing YouTube videos in general since Tyler Oakley is very well known on YouTube.
"When somebody with a lot of attention talks about this, it's obviously going to reach hundreds and thousands of people, a lot more than I am able to reach at the moment so it's really good!"
