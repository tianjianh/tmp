[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jim Furyk has become the first player in PGA Tour history to shoot a round of 58 at the Travelers Championship in Connecticut.

The 46-year-old American hit a total of 10 birdies and an eagle to shoot a 12-under-par round.
Furyk was already one of six men to have hit a sub 60 total for 18 holes.
Despite his record-breaking round Furyk is not in contention to win as he is still four behind leader Daniel Berger, before he starts his final round.
Furyk told Sky Sports 4: "It's pretty cool.
"A million and a half rounds played in the history of the PGA Tour and you look at the great names ahead of me. It's humbling, to stand alone at 58 is really a cool accomplishment.
"I never thought I'd have the opportunity to shoot 59 so once we accomplished that goal I said, 'I had my one chance, I was able to go ahead and birdie the last hole and do it, it'll probably never happen again', and lo and behold, I made the turn today and said, 'here we go again'.
"It's fun to break that barrier and be the first one."
