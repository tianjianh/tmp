[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Andrew Young has become the first Briton to win a World Cup cross-country sprint medal with third place in Italy.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 23-year-old won his semi-final to qualify for his first final and led midway through the medal race.
However, he was overtaken by eventual winner Federico Pellegrino of Italy and Simeon Hamilton of the United States on the final climb of the 1.3km race.
The Scot held on for third and punched the air in delight as he crossed the line 0.84 seconds behind Pellegrino.
