Bird, who was assistant head coach last season, replaces Mo'onia Gerrard, who stepped down at the end of the 2017 campaign, their first in Superleague.
"She's got a wealth of experience as a coach, with Hertfordshire Mavericks previously," said Severn Stars co-founding director Dr Anita Navin.
"We're pleased Sam will take the helm. It's continuity. Our players know her."
Navin told BBC Hereford & Worcester: "We've been through a rigorous process. Sometimes it's harder being an internal candidate than external but Sam's experience as head coach was what shone through."
Bird, who works as a solicitor for the Metropolitan Police, is also a national selector and England's mid-court technical coach.
In her 11 years with Hertfordshire Mavericks, they twice finished top of the Superleague table.
Severn Stars co-founding director Dr Anita Navin was talking to BBC Hereford & Worcester's Dan Wheeler.
