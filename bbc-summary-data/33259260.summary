Ms Dugdale and Ken Macintosh are vying for the post left vacant by Jim Murphy.
Fellow MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Baker are in the race for deputy leader along with Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson.
Unison Labour Link confirmed it was supporting Ms Dugdale and Mr Rowley in the contest.
Chairman Gordon McKay said Scottish Labour needed to change direction, and predicted Ms Dugdale and Mr Rowley would make a good team.
He added: "Kezia will provide energetic leadership and Alex offers experience and commitment. They have both shown they are prepared to take Scottish Labour out of its comfort zone."
Lothian MSP Ms Dugdale, who had served as deputy leader under Mr Murphy, said she was delighted by the move.
She added: "It shows that I can be a uniting force for our movement by bringing together all the different elements of the Labour movement."
