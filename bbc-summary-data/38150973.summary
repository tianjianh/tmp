An out-of sorts Ding fought back from 2-0 down to 2-2, but world number 39 Jones, 28, had little trouble closing out a richly deserved 6-2 success.
Mark Williams and Matthew Stevens had already made it through.
But Shaun Murphy and Mark Allen progressed to stop Wales making it five out of five at the York Barbican.
Ryan Day played almost flawless snooker to go 4-0 ahead against Allen, but a brilliant 136 sparked a five-frame burst by the Northern Irishman.
Although Day levelled at 5-5, world number 10 Allen won a nervy final frame to set up a last-16 meeting with three-time champion John Higgins.
In the afternoon session, world number six Murphy almost blew a 5-2 lead over Dominic Dale, but held his nerve in an error-strewn decider to win 6-5.
It was therefore left to Jones, who plays David Gilbert in the last 16, to provide the biggest upset of the day by earning "one of the best wins of his career".
"That's very pleasing," Jones said. "I felt very calm. Ding wasn't at his best but I got in early, put him under pressure and I took advantage."

World number 16 Williams beat world number 17 Ricky Walden in a thrilling final-frame decider.
The 41-year-old Welshman trailed 5-3 but scored his fourth half-century to keep the match alive and made his experience count in a nervy finale.
Williams, who plays Englishman Liam Highfield in the last 16 on Thursday, said he was "over the moon" with a win that showed he can "still do it when he needs to".
Murphy, the 2008 champion, survived an almighty scare to scrape through 6-5 against Dale and said he was lucky to progress after making "mistake after mistake after mistake".
World number 42 Stevens had earlier become the first Welshman to reach the last 16 at the tournament since 2012, scoring three half centuries in a row as he beat ninth seed Joe Perry 6-2 in emphatic fashion.
"I felt comfortable out there. I wasn't expected to win but that's now three wins in a row and I feel confident," said Stevens, who faces Ronnie O'Sullivan in the last 16.

Oliver Lines continued his superb run, the world number 61 matching his best-ever ranking event performance by thumping Jimmy Robertson 6-0 to reach round four.
"I played really well and handled the occasion," said the 21-year-old, who beat world number three Judd Trump in round two and next faces Hong Kong's Marco Fu. "Hopefully this can kick-start my career."
Scotland's Stephen Maguire and China's Zhang Anda completed the last-16 line-up, Maguire beating Ireland's Fergal O'Brien 6-5 and Zhang seeing off Englishman Mitchell Mann 6-3.
