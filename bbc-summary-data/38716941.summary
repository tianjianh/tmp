[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cornish Pirates coach Gavin Cattle says his side has room for improvement despite their 50-24 win over Connacht.

They ran in seven tries to finish second in Pool Three and book their British & Irish Cup quarter-final spot.
"There was some sloppiness in there that we'll have to rectify in the week," Cattle told BBC Radio Cornwall.
"I thought the score flattered us a little bit - it was only in that second 20 minutes in the first half where they missed a few one-on-ones."
Alex O'Meara scored a hat-trick at the Mennaye, with captain Chris Morgan, Bar Bartlett, Jake Parker, and Alex Day also going over.
Pirates had Marlen Walker sin-binned while fly-half Bartlett suffered a rib injury, with the club awaiting results from an x-ray.
"Us coaches are always going to be picky with the performance," added Cattle.
"When we had the sin-binning it looked a little bit disjointed from the scrum but they're things we can iron out."
