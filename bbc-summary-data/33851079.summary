Couple deny sex act during Paloma Faith concert in London

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A couple who allegedly engaged in oral sex during a Paloma Faith concert in Hyde Park went "beyond the bounds of public decency", a judge has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lisanne Beck, 47, and her boyfriend Simon Murphy, 48, from Swansea, were filmed on a mobile phone at the family event on 14 September last year.
A child nearby had to be shielded, said one onlooker.
The couple have pleaded not guilty to behaving indecently by engaging in sexual activity including oral sex.
A jury at the Old Bailey was told by prosecuting lawyer Tom Cleeve the alleged act was seen by several members of the public and went "beyond the bounds of public decency".
Mr Cleeve said the couple were "worse for wear" and seemed to be drunk.
It appears that Ms Beck "undid his shorts" and carried out a sex act, he said. Security were called and the couple were thrown out of the concert.
Ms Beck later said he had not done anything wrong and was just trying to wake Mr Murphy up.
He said he was completely unaware of anything indecent happening, the court was told.
