The 24-year-old has signed a promotional deal with Matchroom Boxing and will fight on the undercard of the WBA lightweight title fight between Anthony Crolla and Jorge Linares.
McGoldrick was Commonwealth champion in 2010 and won bronze four years later.
He will fight at Bantamweight against an as yet announced opponent.
"I am so excited to be turning pro," McGoldrick said.
"I set myself new goals in the amateurs, to win medals and to progress, and now I've turned pro, I go back to that goal of wanting to become a world champion and the best I can be."
