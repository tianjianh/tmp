The Met Police said the woman, 33, had been arrested at Luton Airport on suspicion of child abduction.
Police made an appeal for information after the family went missing from Waltham Forest last week. They were detained in Turkey on Tuesday.
The woman's four children are in police protection, police said.
The woman and her children - aged from four to 12 - were last seen on 25 August boarding a flight to Amsterdam from London City Airport, the Met Police said.
Detectives later found the family had been pictured on security cameras at the airport.
The force said that "due to concerns she [the woman] was intending to travel to Syria with her children" an appeal for information was launched.
Officers then received official confirmation on Tuesday that the family had been detained in Turkey by Turkish authorities.
