The housebuilder said the developments would "underpin" more than 6,000 existing jobs and support more than 200 local suppliers and contractors.
New developments to be launched early in 2017 include Allan Park in Aberdeen and Weirs Wynd in Renfrewshire.
The news follows a strong year for Barratt Developments, which includes Barratt Homes and David Wilson Homes.
In the year to the end of June, it opened 12 new sites across Scotland with a total of 1,556 homes.
Developments included Westerwood Gardens in Dalkeith, Westburn Gardens in Aberdeen and Lauder Gardens in Strathaven.
Douglas McLeod, regional managing director for Barratt Developments, said: "Demand for good quality homes in desirable locations is still high across Scotland, and our ambitions for the year ahead are a reflection of our confidence in the housing market.
"We're seeing strong interest across the property spectrum, ranging from first time buyers interested in our starter homes, to older homeowners looking to down size.
"We'll continue to build homes which meet these varied demands.
"At the same time, our plans will allow us to continue employing and supporting local construction jobs across the Scotland, providing a boost to both Scotland's economy and to local communities in areas where we are active."
