Shaun Whiter, 27, was helping his friend Joey Abbs change a flat tyre in Newmarket, Suffolk, on 1 July when the crash occurred.
The Spurs fan received a letter from Mauricio Pochettino praising his "incredible courage".
Mr Whiter is still in hospital undergoing further procedures.
He worked as an estate agent in Stansted, Essex, and was due to begin training with Newmarket Town FC when he was crushed by a vehicle as he tried to help his friend fix his car.

Pochettino wrote: "Your determination and strength is an inspiration to others..."
On his Facebook page Mr Whiter thanked his friends for raising awareness of what happened.
"A massive bit of respect for Mauricio Pochettino taking the time and making this letter a whole lot more personal to me and my story," he wrote.
Mr Whiter, a keen all-round sportsman has expressed his determination to take part in the Paralympics in the future.
He is also due to marry his fiancÃ©e Charlotte Way next July and has vowed to "walk down the aisle".
"There is no doubt that with your remarkable spirit and resolution, you will be walking down the aisle," Mr Pochettino's letter continued.
Commenting on the letter, Mr Whiter's brother Luke said: "I knew Spurs was the team to support... Shaun we will be back down the lane in no time..."
Mr Whiter's friend Mr Abbs, who plays football for Cambridgeshire club Soham Town Rangers, suffered a "serious" leg injury in the crash.
Several football clubs have arranged tribute matches for both players and well-wishers have pledged close to Â£75,000 on fundraising websites.
A 40-year-old man from Haverhill, Suffolk, has been charged with two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and is due at Cambridge Crown Court on 8 August.
