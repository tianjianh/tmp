[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The body was found in "suspicious circumstances" in Scotland Street at about 05:30. Detectives revealed the man sustained "significant injuries".
Another man in the flat is being treated as a "significant witness" and is helping police with their inquiry.
Two cars parked outside the property have been taped off.
One car has a sign lying on the backseat asking for donations for someone who is homeless.
The note in the car reads: "Please can you spare some change, I'm homeless or even something to eat, I'm really desperate. Any donations would be appreciated. Thank you and God Bless. Merry Xmas"
A second car containing a bag full of medical prescriptions has also been taped off by police.
Police said they were seizing the cars as they were "connected to the flat".
Police broke the door down of the flat after receiving several calls from neighbours about a "significant disturbance".
There were only two men, in their 20s, in the flat at the time of the disturbance, one of who is now dead.
Det Ch Insp Keith Hardie, of Police Scotland, said a weapon was possibly used.
He said: "We have found a body in suspicious circumstances, which has sustained significant injuries."
He added: "With this in mind it is imperative that we trace those involved in this incident as soon as possible.
"I would urge anyone who was in the Scotland Street area on the morning of Friday 2 December to get in touch with us immediately."
