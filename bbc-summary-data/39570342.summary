Fans at the 80,000-seater Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, who had already arrived for the match, were told to stay there until it was safe to leave.
The stadium was later evacuated safely and police thanked the fans for their co-operation.
Borrusia Dormund and their fans used social media to help find the thousands of Monaco supporters, who had travelled to Germany for the match, a place to stay for the night.
