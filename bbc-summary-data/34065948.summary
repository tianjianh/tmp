Concerns about Dumfries and Galloway police response

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Concerns have been raised that police officers no longer attend some low level crimes in Dumfries and Galloway.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is one of a series of issues likely to be outlined in a report to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) by the local council.
The inspectorate is undertaking an independent review of call handling procedures by Police Scotland.
It follows the discovery of John Yuill, 28, and Lamara Bell, 25, in a crashed car three days after it was reported.
Dumfries and Galloway Council will also raise concerns about a lack of local knowledge by telephone operators.
A report to the Police, Fire and Rescue Services sub-committee said not all locations in the region were linked to postcodes.
It added: "Dumfries and Galloway residents have previously enjoyed a good police presence during normal business and in response to reported incidents.
"Comments from residents to local elected members are that police constables are now not attending some levels of reported crime."
The report said call handlers are providing incident numbers, rather sending a police officer.
It added: "Rural crime and level of crime are different to that experienced in other parts of Scotland."
The council's response to the HMICS review will be considered by the sub-committee on 3 September.
Ch Supt Mike Leslie, of Police Scotland, has said previously there have been a number of "learning points" since Dumfries control room closed.
He said the differences in priorities around the country was an issue that was being addressed.
