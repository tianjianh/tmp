Swansea have gone six Premier League games without a win and Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Liverpool increased the pressure on Guidolin.
Britton says uncertainty regarding the Italian's future has been unsettling.
"It's not great but the modern day footballer understands it's part of the game," he said.
"I think the way we played out there [against Liverpool], and the way we pushed and the way we worked shows that we're behind the manager. But we can't stop speculation."
Guidolin is the odds on favourite to be the next Premier League boss to leave his post.
Swansea's American owners, Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien, were at the Liberty Stadium for the Liverpool game, but have yet to decide on Guidolin's future.
Although they are alarmed by the club's predicament, Swansea's owners are understood to have no immediate plans to sack the 60-year-old Italian.
Ex-Manchester United and Wales winger Ryan Giggs and former USA manager Bob Bradley have been linked with the Swans post.
Swansea's worst start to a league season for 25 years, with only four points from their opening seven games, have left them one place above the relegation zone.
Guidolin, who had admitted before the game his job could be under threat if his side failed to beat Liverpool, believes the Swans can haul themselves out of relegation danger.
Saturday's loss to Liverpool was the Swans' third in succession but Britton has urged his team mates not to get too disappointed with recent results.
"It's still very early in the season. But at the same time we would have liked more points on the board," Britton added.
"You can look at the fixtures and say that the games that we've played have been tough.
"But it's all about getting points on the board. We need to make sure that in the next game [Arsenal away] that we get a result."
Swansea's next game following the international break will be away at the Emirates on Saturday, 15 October.
