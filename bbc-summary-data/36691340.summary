The victory gave Hungary's Danuta Kozak a fifth Olympic gold medal and her third at Rio 2016.
Germany claimed silver, finishing 0.901 seconds adrift, with third-placed Belarus 2.426secs behind the winners.
GB's four of Rachel Cawthorn, Louisa Gurski, Rebii Simon and Jess Walker were 5.561secs behind Hungary.
"I'm disappointed but relieved we got into the final," said Walker. "We've enjoyed this journey.
"Rachel has been ill for a really big chunk of this winter so she's done amazingly."
Cawthorn: "We all gave it everything we had out there and we're all shaking trying to walk back now. All our muscles are empty."
Helen Reeves - Olympic bronze medallist and BBC canoeing pundit:
"We know Great Britain are good in the second 250 metres, but this demonstrates that you can't leave such a big gap.
"GB have to work out how they can do better between 100 metres and 200 metres to ensure they don't have as much water to make up in the second half of the race."
