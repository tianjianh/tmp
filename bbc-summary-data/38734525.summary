The Gower Hotel in Bishopston, Swansea, which employed 23 people, closed without warning on New Year's Eve.
Insolvency specialist Begbies Traynor hosted a meeting of creditors to place the company in voluntary liquidation at its Cardiff office on Wednesday.
The venue had bookings for 32 events up until September 2018, including 28 weddings.
Speaking after the meeting, Claire Phillips, 38, and Simon Evans, 31, from Swansea said the loss of their money and wedding venue had left them "stressed and upset".
The couple, who are due to marry in April 2018, lost a £500 deposit they paid in November.
Ms Phillips said: "We've almost certainly lost all the money we've paid because we're an unsecured creditor.
"It does tarnish it and make you paranoid about planning anything."
Jazmine Parry, 30, from Swansea, was due to marry Kurt Tracey, 31, at the venue on 27 April.
She told the Jason Mohammad programme earlier this month she was "gutted" and they had paid £5,000 toward the cost.
Begbies Traynor said after losing staff and suffering from ill health, the owners were no longer able to run the venue and were "deeply sorry".
Consumer law expert Prof Margaret Griffiths said: "Unfortunately, of course, people like Jazmine and the other couples involved will be what's termed unsecured creditors, so they will actually be at the end of the line when it comes to paying out for the insolvency of the firm."
