[SN]TITLE[SN]
Newport County 1-0 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County's fourth win in five matches lifted them out of the League Two relegation zone as Ryan Bird's goal saw-off Accrington Stanley.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Bird headed-in from a yard on the hour after Mark Randall's shot had been saved by Marek Rodak.
Hartlepool's defeat by Barnet means the Exiles are out of the bottom two just six weeks after being 11 points adrift.
The loss was a blow to Accrington's rapidly diminishing chances of a place in the play-offs.
Accrington are five points adrift of seventh place with two matches remaining.
Meanwhile Newport find themselves two points ahead of Hartlepool and could secure League Two survival with a win at Carlisle on 29 April.
Newport County caretaker manager Mike Flynn told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "It feels absolutely amazing, but we're keeping grounded, there's nothing done yet, nothing achieved.
"We've just got ourselves in a good position and we've got to keep going now until the end of the season.
"It has been a great turnaround and the boys have been fantastic. I would have wanted a few more goals but I'll take another couple of 1-0 wins before the end of the season."
