[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hawick wind farm application lodged

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans have been lodged for a 12-turbine wind farm development on uplands to the south of Hawick.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Energiekontor UK had originally been looking at building 15 turbines as part of the Pines Burn project.
It has scaled down its proposals following a series of public exhibitions in the area.
The company has estimated that the development could meet the annual energy needs of more than 22,000 homes if it goes ahead.
