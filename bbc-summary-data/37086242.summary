The woman, in her 40s, died at a block of flats in Ruth Bagnall Court, Cambridge, on Sunday evening.
She got into difficulty with the automatic shutter doors at the entrance to an underground garage, the Cambridge News reported.
Housing group Luminus, which manages the block, said it was assisting the Health and Safety Executive with its inquiries.
Paramedics were called to a report of a woman not breathing in Coleridge Road, the East of England Ambulance Service said.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
A Luminus spokesman said Cambridge Police informed them a woman had died as a result of "an accident involving a car park security shutter" and it was helping the force with its inquiries.
