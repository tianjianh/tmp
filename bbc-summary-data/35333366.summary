Winter weather: Drivers warned over snow and ice

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Drivers are being warned to take care on the roads as many people across the UK see their first snow this winter.

The Met Office has issued a yellow warning to "be aware" of snow and ice.
A corridor of snow 100 miles (160km) wide is moving from western Scotland, through the English Midlands, to London and south-east England overnight.
BBC Weather's Jay Wynne said a few centimetres (one inch) of snow were likely on low levels, with up to 10cm possible at higher levels in Scotland.
Parts of rural Scotland may see temperatures drop to -10C (14F) for a second night, he added.
The Met Office says clear skies will allow temperatures to fall widely to below freezing on Saturday evening, making untreated footpaths and cyclepaths turn icy.
There were further warnings of freezing fog on Sunday morning, which is expected to be slow to clear.
Latest local information from the BBC
Between one and three centimetres of snow are likely at low levels, with between five and 10cm possible above 200m across western Scotland and Cumbria.
In Scotland, all five snow sports centres were able to open their slopes for skiing and snowboarding.
Climbers and hillwalkers, however, were warned that the risk of avalanches in Scotland's highest hills and mountains was "considerable".
All areas of the UK are affected by the Met Office's yellow "be aware" warnings for either ice or snow or both, except Wales, Northern Ireland, the Grampian region, north-east England and the islands of Orkney and Shetland.
The warning is in place until mid-morning on Sunday.
The Met Office has three categories for its warnings - red, amber and yellow - with red as the most severe.
It said less cold conditions should start to develop during Sunday, allowing some snow to start melting.
