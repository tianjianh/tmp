George Ford and Owen Farrell also scored tries as England moved away late on to win convincingly in Rome.
"He read the game well. A 13 is like a number eight in that he has to be able to read the game well and he did that exceptionally well," said Jones.
The England coach also praised Joseph's attacking and defensive display.

England, who remain on course for the Grand Slam after wins over Scotland and Italy, had a real fight for the first 50 minutes.
But they started to dominate as the game progressed on their way to making it 22 wins in 22 meetings.
"We wanted to be two from two and we're two from two. We did some good things in the second half. In the first half we allowed Italy into the game," Jones said.
"I was pleased by the way that we put them away [but] we could have scored 60 points out there. In the end we were quite dominant."
Centre Joseph said England were "proud of that performance".
"We showed what England can do," the 24-year-old added. "We needed to come out firing in the second half - the errors from the first half were eradicated and we kicked on."
Captain Dylan Hartley described it as a "very satisfying" win, adding: "The bench were impressive in the last 20 - I'm chuffed to bits with the young fellas."
