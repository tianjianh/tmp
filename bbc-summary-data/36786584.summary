[SN]TITLE[SN]
Phoebe Willis death: Nurse not guilty of manslaughter

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A nurse who fit a feeding tube to a 10-year-old girl who later died has been cleared of manslaughter.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Phoebe Willis was admitted to Weston General Hospital in August 2012 to have a tube replaced and died two days later.
Carrie-Anne Nash, 33, from North Somerset, was charged with manslaughter on the grounds of gross negligence.
She was found not guilty at Bristol Crown Court earlier.
Phoebe, from Locking, had cystinosis - a rate genetic condition that causes damage to the kidneys, eyes and other major organs .
She had been fed by a tube since her diagnosis as a baby, which was normally changed at home by her parents, Julian and Heather Willis, every three months.
But they experienced difficulty replacing it on 24 August 2012 and were referred to Weston General, where Ms Nash fitted the tube.
Phoebe was then sent home but woke up the next morning feeling unwell.  Two days later she died from peritonitis - inflammation of the tissue inside the abdomen - at Bristol Children's Hospital.
In October 2013, the Avon coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death and said there had been a lack of communication in Phoebe's treatment.
Cystinosis affects about 150 people in the UK.  It occurs when an amino acid called cystine accumulates in cells rather than being expelled from the body.
