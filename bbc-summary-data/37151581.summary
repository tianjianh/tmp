Hundreds of Australians have lined the streets of Brisbane to watch actors Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston film scenes for Thor: Ragnarok.

Parts of the city have been transformed to look like New York - complete with yellow taxis and US police cars.
The filmmakers have primarily worked in Gold Coast studios, but on Monday closed off a handful of Brisbane's streets to film outdoor scenes.
Producers have promised to keep traffic disruptions as brief as possible.
Australian mental health charity Livin also saw a surge in sales of a jumper bearing their name, after Hollywood heart-throb Hemsworth was photographed wearing one on-set.
The charity, whose motto is "it ain't weak to speak", hopes to take on the stigma around mental health through clothing and events, and was reportedly very grateful for the actor's support.
This is the third film in a series based on the Marvel Comics superhero, who is in turn modelled on the Norse god of thunder.
The film's plot has been kept closely under wraps but involves Thor taking on an apocalyptic threat.
The film is slated for a release in November 2017 and also stars Sir Anthony Hopkins, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo and Jeff Goldblum.
The production is expected to inject about A$100m (Â£60m, $75m) into the local economy.
