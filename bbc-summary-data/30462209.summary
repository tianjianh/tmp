Ian Baraclough wants to "win trophies" with Motherwell, having been chosen to succeed departed manager Stuart McCall.

The 44-year Englishman was sacked by Sligo Rovers in June, having won the League of Ireland title and two cups in a two-and-a-half year stint.
Kenny Black, McCall's assistant, will take the team for Saturday's home game with Ross County.
Black's future is unclear, with talks planned over the coming days to establish whether he will stay on.
Baraclough was one of six candidates interviewed for the post, with Terry Butcher taking himself out of contention this week.
Former players Mitchell van der Gaag and Rob Maaskant were spoken to, along with ex-Kilmarnock manager Kenny Shiels and Black.
"It will be a hard task to take over from Stuart but one I'm very excited to take up," Baraclough told the club website.
"I'm a positive guy and I'm upbeat most of the time. The players will find that and I'll try and get that across to them. I want this club to feel energised and start climbing the table as soon as possible."
Motherwell finished second behind Celtic in the top flight in the last two seasons but have struggled for form this term and sit 10th in the Premiership, with just three wins from 15 games.
McCall resigned in early November after a run of five consecutive defeats, having joined the club in 2010.
Baraclough had a brief spell as manager of Scunthorpe from September 2010 to March 2011, having ended his playing career at Glanford Park.
"Short-term my aim is to keep this club in the Premiership," added Baraclough. "There is no easy way to go about that and it is a situation that hasn't been at this football club in a few years but it doesn't scare me.
"I feel as though there is more than enough to push us up the table in the short term then try and build for long term by producing players. I am big on development, so the young players will certainly have a pathway to the first team if they are good enough.
"I want to win trophies. Why not Motherwell Football Club? Why can't we win the Premiership?
"You've got to go out with that thinking otherwise you won't achieve anything. To have days out in the cup are great for fans, but they are important. It's a way into Europe and I've been used to that and want more of it, as I'm sure the fans do too."
