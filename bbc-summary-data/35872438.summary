Spinner Heather Knight struck with the third ball of the match, claiming 3-15, and despite two dropped catches England restricted India to 90-8.
In reply England twice lost two wickets in two balls against the spinners, with slow left-armer Ekta Bisht taking 4-21.
There were also two needless run-outs before England won with six balls left.
England next play on Thursday against West Indies, who have also won their first two matches in Group B.

India's innings contained only eight fours and England had struck seven in reply by midway through the sixth over, but their attacking approach also resulted in a flurry of wickets.
Having dispatched Harmanpreet Kaur - top-scorer in the match with a purposeful 26 - confidently on both sides of the wicket for three successive boundaries, Tammy Beaumont top-edged a sweep and was caught at midwicket.
Then next ball the wicket of star player Sarah Taylor, who had earlier taken an outstanding low catch behind the stumps, sent India and their excitable supporters into raptures.
Taylor, second in the ICC T20 batting rankings, had scored 15 from her first seven deliveries but was drawn out of her crease by Kaur and comfortably stumped.
Bisht, bowling in a cap a la Geoffrey Boycott, lured Knight out of her ground to create another stumping and left-hander Lydia Greenway registered a golden duck, lbw playing across the line.

Pressure led to some poor running between the wickets, and an over-eager Dani Wyatt was run out at the non-striker's end by a direct hit and Jenny Gunn was short of the line attempting a quick single.
Katherine Brunt survived an lbw appeal that replays showed was hitting the stumps and Anya Shrubsole was dropped at cover, before the latter drove a winning boundary as a highly-relieved England, who have lost Dani Hazell for the remainder of the event to injury, reached their target.
Former England all-rounder Ebony Rainford-Brent on BBC Test Match Special: "England coach Mark Robinson gave the team a six out of 10 in their last game, I'd say this was not a six, more like a five.
"The key was trying to go too hard at times from England. There were forced shots. I don't think England handled the left-armer particularly well today. It's two from two but there are areas to look at - including the catching."
England captain Charlotte Edwards: "I have felt that nervous before but it doesn't get any easier watching the last few runs. The most important thing is we got a win here.
"I thought we did well to break the back of that score in the first six overs but then it got away from us a bit."
India captain Mithali Raj: "We are still in the competition. We hope to win against West Indies and we will rely on the result of the other matches.
"We realised how difficult it was to score on this pitch. A little more application from the bowlers in the initial overs could have pulled us through."
England have a quick turnaround, facing West Indies at the same venue on Thursday - while India, now needing other results to go their way if they are to make the semi-finals, host the Windies at Mohail in their final group game on Sunday 27 March.
