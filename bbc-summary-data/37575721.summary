Owen Creaney: Policeman found 'foot and hand' in bin

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The trial of a man and woman accused of murdering Owen 'Fonzie' Creaney have heard from the policeman who made the discovery of his body in a recycle bin.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The constable's statement was read to the jury at Belfast Crown Court on Thursday.
Stephen Thomas Hughes, 29, and Shaunean Boyle, 25, are both jointly charged with Mr Creaney's murder in 2014.
The pair blame each other for the attack that led to the 40-year-old's death in Craigavon, County Armagh.
The officer told the court he found the blue wheelie bin at the rear of Mr Hughes' property at Moyraverty Court in Craigavon on 5 July, 2014.
When he opened the lid of the bin, he said that it was "overflowing with cardboard and paper''.
After moving some of the material out of the way, the constable said: "I saw a human foot and I saw a human hand with a silver wedding band on one of the fingers.
"I removed more rubbish and a human torso come into view. The body appeared to be compacted in.''
The court heard that the officer's statement was put to Stephen Hughes during the course of his police interviews.
He was asked by a detective: "Did you squash his body down into the bin?''
Mr Hughes replied: "The two of us did. We just pushed him in.''
Asked if they "forced him down'' into the bin, the suspect replied that he was "pushing with [his] two hands''.
Hughes was asked: "Did you at any time get into the bin?'' He replied: "No. Just pushed him down.''
Under further questioning,  Mr Hughes said he helped Ms Boyle to dispose of the body as "I wanted to protect her as I know what it is like to lose your children. I just freaked out. I didn't know what to do. I was telling her to phone an ambulance.''
The court heard that after police were alerted by a witness that Mr Creaney was dead, officers called at the house, where Mr Hughes took time to answer the door. When he eventually opened it, his hands were covered in paint.
During police interviews, he said that he was painting over "speckles of blood'' from a wall.
The detective told Mr Hughes that the police could smell the bleach from outside the front door.
He asked the defendant: "Were you not at least concerned for your friend Fonzie, who was lying upstairs - an alcoholic disabled man? You denied him healthcare, you denied him a chance to recover from the injuries he received in the assault. Why was that?''
Mr Hughes made no reply.
The detective asked: "Did you shower the deceased? Did you give him a shower because he was stinking the place out? Did you give him a shower because he was smelling the place out because he had wet himself?''
Again, Mr Hughes made no reply to the question.
He then asked Mr Hughes if he "just snapped", but received no response.
Earlier, the jury heard that Mr Hughes' mobile phone was examined by an expert, who found that during the 20 hours he claimed to be sleeping, his phone was active with text messages and phone calls.
Two of the text messages were from his co-accused, Ms Boyle. One read: "Is he still alive?'' Another asked: "Where is Fonzie's phone?''
Mr Hughes would not say if he remembered the texts.
Both Mr Hughes - whose address was given as HMP Maghaberry - and Ms Boyle, from Edenderry Park in Banbridge, County Down, were remanded back into custody.
