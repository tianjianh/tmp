The result in Dakar was enough for both teams to qualify with Algeria finishing top of the group and Nigeria ending as runners-up.
Egypt's faint hopes of progressing were dashed after they lost 1-0 to Mali in the other Group B match in M'Bour after Ragab Abdelnabi scored an own-goal in the 18th minute.
Saturday's results mean the semi-final line-up is complete.
Nigeria will play the Group A winners Senegal, whilst Algeria will take on the Group A runners-up South Africa.
Both semi-finals will be played on Wednesday 9 December.
The tournament also serves as a qualifying competition for next year's Olympic Games with the top three finishers booking a place in Rio.
