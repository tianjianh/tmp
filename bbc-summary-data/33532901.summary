Rebecca Evans said officials have been liaising with UK counterparts since the H7N7 bird flu case was identified in Lancashire with controls put in place.
The deputy minister for farming and food said no bird exhibitors from the restricted zone will be allowed at next week's Royal Welsh Show in Powys.
The annual event starts on Monday.
Royal Welsh Agricultural Society assistant chief executive Aled Jones said it takes "biosecurity risk extremely seriously" and will maintain strict protocols while continuing to monitor the situation.
Signs of the disease in birds include respiratory distress, diarrhoea and blue discolouration of the neck and throat.
The H7N7 strain is contagious in flocks but is "very rare" in humans.
