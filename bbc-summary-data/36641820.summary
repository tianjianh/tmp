The 24-year-old was called up to the Australia squad for their friendly with England last month, having previously played for Scotland Under-21s.
The Adelaide-born player moved to Britain when he was 14 to sign for Newcastle's academy.
"I am delighted to have him on board," Peterborough manager Grant McCann told the club website.
"Brad is a good player, he can play anywhere in the front three or in a diamond formation, he likes to get at people with the ball and scores goals.
"He is a player that I have watched a lot of. He scored 10 goals from midfield for Crewe last season and is a very exciting player."
