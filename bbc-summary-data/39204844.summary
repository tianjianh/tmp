Barrow manager Paul Cox says he is not able to comment on the continued absence of his assistant Gary Simpson from recent matches.

Simpson, 55, has not been in the dugout since the 1-0 National League win at Macclesfield on 15 February.
Barrow have not made an official statement to explain Simpson's absence from the club's past five matches.
"It's something I cannot comment on at the minute," Cox told BBC Radio Cumbria. "It's an internal matter."
Former Lincoln and Macclesfield boss Simpson joined Cox as his assistant in February 2016.
He has missed games against Torquay, Guiseley, Sutton and two against Tranmere Rovers, including a 2-1 victory on Tuesday.
"I'm hoping either myself or the club can keep everybody up to date with that issue when and if it is resolved," Cox added.
Asked whether Simpson would be returning to his role or not, Cox again refused to comment.
"We want to be 100% certain that the information we give everybody is correct," he said.
