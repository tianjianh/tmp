[SN]TITLE[SN]
Japanese conservationists to visit Skye to see otters

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Conservationists are to visit Skye to learn more about otter habitats ahead of a proposed reintroduction of the mammals to Japan.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Otters were declared extinct on the Japanese islands by its Ministry of the Environment in August 2012.
The Skye-based International Otter Survival Fund (IOSF) has been helping with the reintroduction preparations.
Dr Takahiro Murakami, who will lead the Japanese visit to Scotland, has never seen otters in the wild.
The Japanese otter was believed to be either a subspecies of the Eurasian otter or possibly even a separate species.
Conservationists have suggested reintroducing otters to Hokkaido, an island in north Japan.
IOSF supports conservation projects across the world.
It also rescues and raises orphaned otter cubs.
