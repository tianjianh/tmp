Blackpool Pleasure Beach has banned picnics from being consumed inside the 42-acre attraction.

Visitors who want to eat their own food have been told to eat it at a picnic site outside before entering the theme park.
Admission staff have begun checking visitors' bags for sandwiches and recommending restaurants on site.
More than six million people a year visit the attraction, which charges Â£86 for an all-day family ticket.
A section of the park's website said: "We do not allow people to picnic within the park.
"Pleasure Beach is experiencing a growing problem with visitors using our restaurants' tables to eat food they have brought in themselves.
"In order to alleviate this, it is our aim to stop people with excessive food from setting up a full meal."
Blackpool Pleasure Beach said that allowances are made for guests with special dietary requirements and dedicated picnic areas are also provided for school parties which book in advance.
Councillor Fred Jackson, deputy Labour leader on Blackpool Council said: "I think it's very sad.
"It's not a family-friendly policy, which is a shame because we all want Blackpool to be family-oriented.
"When our children were younger we couldn't afford to eat in cafes and always had picnics - and there are plenty of people in that position today.
"I would like the Pleasure Beach to reverse that decision."
Blackpool Zoo and Camelot at nearby Chorley both allow picnics to be brought in, in common with other attractions including Alton Towers and Thorpe Park.
