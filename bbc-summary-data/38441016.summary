Fernando Llorente is also a doubt after picking up a knock, but Jefferson Montero is definitely absent.
Crystal Palace manager Sam Allardyce: "Our players need to get ready for Swansea on Tuesday night - that's the big game they need to win.
"Watching Premier League football this year, the top six are so much better than last year so it's always hard to pick up points against them. "Our big game's on Tuesday, there's no doubt about it. We're going to survive by beating teams in the bottom half."
Swansea caretaker manager Alan Curtis: "The first goal seems to be crucial at the moment.
"Confidence seems to drain from us when we go behind. I suppose the explanation for that is that we are bottom of the table, we are not winning games and we are conceding too many goals.
"It's a crisis of confidence when we concede a goal."
A lot of journalists have been saying Crystal Palace should avoid relegation now Sam Allardyce is in charge. They should never have been close to relegation in the first place.
As for Swansea, this should be Paul Clement's first game and with any new manager you always get a reaction.  I just don't think it will be enough for this fixture.
