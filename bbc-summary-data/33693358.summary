[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Braydon Anderson appeared on the 18th century building's roof after a climate change rally on the streets below.
Anderson, who pleaded guilty at Southwark Crown Court, smashed windows with a broom handle and a gold-plated crown he had broken off a column.
He shattered a stained glass window and 11 others on 7 March last year.
A CCTV camera was also smashed during the spree.
After police, fire and ambulance crews arrived, Anderson engaged officers in an eight-hour stand off. He was arrested at 05:15 GMT the following day.
Anderson, of Portland Place in Northampton, admitted criminal damage and wore a blue long-sleeved top in court.
He was remanded in custody until the sentencing hearing, adjourned by Judge Deborah Taylor until 1 September for sentence at Southwark.
A psychiatric report has been carried out.
Security at Parliament was re-examined after the incident and Speaker John Bercow told MPs immediate remedial actions were being taken to address security failings.
