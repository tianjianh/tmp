[SN]TITLE[SN]
Espanyol 0-6 Real Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cristiano Ronaldo became Real Madrid's record scorer in La Liga after hitting five goals in a demolition of Espanyol.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ronaldo has 230 goals in the Spanish top flight, passing Raul's tally of 228, and is now the fourth-highest scorer in the competition's history.
The Portugal forward hit three inside the first 20 minutes, one a penalty, before Karim Benzema made it 4-0.
Ronaldo, previously without a goal in eight games for club and country, added two more in the second half.
The 30-year-old's record-breaking total has come in just 204 league games for Real following his £80m move from Manchester United in 2009.
Ronaldo needed just seven minutes to end his eight-game goal drought, which covered pre-season friendlies as well as Real's opening two La Liga games of the season.
He curled in the opening goal from Luka Modric's pass, before adding a second from the penalty spot following a foul by Espanyol defender Victor Alvarez.
The forward completed his hat-trick by converting a Gareth Bale cross, then claimed an assist by feeding Benzema to add a fourth with just 28 minutes gone.
Ronaldo did not score again until just past the hour mark, with Bale again the provider, and rounded off a comprehensive win by finishing from Lucas Vazquez's pass towards the end.
