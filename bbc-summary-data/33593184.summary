[SN]TITLE[SN]
Norfolk child sex abuse case 'beyond imagination'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They were seemingly respectable people living ordinary lives.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
But over a period of 10 years, Marie Black, Michael Rogers and Jason Adams treated children "like sexual playthings", at parties, in a hotel room, and at private addresses.
The abuse, which centred around 34-year-old Black and took place in Norwich and Romford, included forcing the children to have sex with one another.
Parties were held, with the adults playing card games to decide who would abuse which child.
In interviews, the victims described how they were abused in front of one another and other adults. Some of the abuse involved children's toys, including Barbie dolls.
They said the abuse became so routine that the victims came to accept it as normal.
One of the male victims said: "There would be parties and they would do some games where the boys were in one room with the men and the girls were in another with the women.
"The adults would have a card game and the winner would get to choose a boy to start touching their private parts and then hurt them afterwards."
One boy told the authorities he didn't know that sexual contact between adults and children was wrong. "I thought it was usual".
Allegations were first reported to police in 2010 but it was in December 2012, when further evidence was disclosed, that police had sufficient evidence to make the initial arrests in 2013.
Several victims described watching Black and Jason Adams - found guilty of 13 counts - taking photos and laughing.
Adams, a former cleaner at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital, had previously gone to jail for a year for assaulting Ms Black and a child.
He admitted cruelty to four children, but denied all the sexual offences. He was found guilty of 13 counts.
"I neglected the children. I ill-treated them. I completely acted in the wrong way, frightened them," he told the court.
He blamed his actions on working nights, tiredness and temper.
Michael Rodgers, of Romford, was found guilty of 14 counts including cruelty, rape and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity.
Six other people on trial were cleared of all charges.
Det Ch Insp Peter Hornby, said the children were all under 13 and were subjected to abuse "beyond most people's imagination".
"It is the most harrowing case I have dealt with in 23 years of policing.
"Marie Black has been found to be at the centre of this abuse and incited others to commit abuse against them.
"She thought they would never speak out.
"Today's verdict is testament to the children's bravery and to the hard work of dedicated professionals from a range of agencies in this case.
"It has brought them the knowledge they are believed and, I hope, will encourage other victims of abuse to find their voice and come forward."
Describing Black, prosecutor Angela Rafferty QC said: "Was she a helpless victim of abusive males or was she herself deeply involved with the children's ill treatment?"
She added: "Many of the defendants have become good at appearing normal and respectable.
"This is what you would have to do in order to be child abusers to the extent alleged here."
Black was painted as a victim by her defence, who maintained she only ended up in court because of a terrible combination of circumstances.
She chose not to give evidence in her own defence, but vehemently denied all the charges against her.
When returning to the dock after the guilty verdicts were read out she said: "We've been stitched up."
The court heard the trial was delayed when prosecutors raised concerns over changes made to statements taken from the children.
But Ms Rafferty said it was "nonsense" that social workers and foster carers were responsible for children making up allegations.
She put it: "Would five small children be able to make up so many things, separately, and in such detail?
"Would they be able to pretend to be distressed or manufacture reluctance to disclose facts about the things they endured?"
"Would they exhibit the sexualised behaviourâ€¦ if these allegations are false?"
