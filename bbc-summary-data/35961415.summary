[SN]TITLE[SN]
Macclesfield Town 0-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Macclesfield striker Jack Sampson went in goal for 86 minutes and kept a clean sheet to halt Dover's winning streak.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts had keeper Richie Branagan sent off for a foul on Ricky Modeste and, with no keeper on the bench, were forced to give Sampson the gloves.
He made several saves but was less busy after Dover's Richard Orlu was red-carded after a clash with Reece Styche.
The Silkmen dominated the second half but could not find a way through and had to settle for a draw.
Dover stay third, and need one win from their remaining three games to seal their play-off place, while Macclesfield cannot now finish in the National League's top five.
