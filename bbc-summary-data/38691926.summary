[SN]TITLE[SN]
Man given supervision order over Innerleithen blow-torch fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who admitted setting fire to his own home with a blow-torch has been given a three-year supervision order.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Paul Hay, 51, of Innerleithen, pleaded guilty to the breach of the peace at the property in Horsburgh Street.
He admitted threatening others with violence, setting fire to the stairs and brandishing a can of petrol and two blow torches in September last year.
Sheriff Peter Paterson said the supervision order was a direct alternative to a prison sentence.
Selkirk Sheriff Court heard Hay also threw items from the house and threatened to kill police officers during the incident.
Defence lawyer Ed Hulme said a build-up of pressures over the past 12 months had got on top of his client.
