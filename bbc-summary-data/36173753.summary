Bellew, 33, beat Mateusz Masternak at the O2 Arena in December to claim the vacant European cruiserweight title.
Congo's Makubu is ranked number one in his division, with all but one of his 19 wins coming inside the distance.
The Liverpool boxer said: "The WBC belt has always been the one that I've wanted to win more than any other."
He added: "I was born to lift that belt on 29 May."
Bellew, an Everton fan who has suffered two light-heavyweight world title defeats, added: "I know I'm going to win, I can't and won't be defeated at Goodison Park - the greatest stadium in the world.
"I'm expecting the city to turn out in their droves as it's going to be a very special event for us all."
