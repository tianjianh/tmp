The 26-year-old France forward was speaking on French TV show Quotidien.
"I think I will decide [on my future] in the next two weeks," he said.
Asked if United would be his new club he replied: "Possible, possible." Asked to give the chances on a scale of one to 10, Griezmann added "six".
The presenter replied: "It's the first time you've said that." And Griezmann replied "it's the first time."
Griezmann, who has won 41 caps for France since making his debut in 2014, scored 26 goals this season as Atletico finished third in La Liga.
He was named the third best player in the world behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the Ballon d'Or awards in January.
There is a 100 million euro (Â£86m) release clause in Griezmann's contract.
United have the opportunity to qualify for the Champions League by winning the Europa League on Wednesday against Ajax in Stockholm.
