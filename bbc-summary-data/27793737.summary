Scottish League Two ins and out - summer 2014

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Scotland captain Barry Ferguson switching from Blackpool to Clyde as player-manager has thrust Scotland's League Two back into the spotlight two seasons after his former club, Rangers, left their financial and publicity mark behind.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ferguson replaced Jim Duffy, who left for Greenock Morton, as four of the division's 10 clubs prepare to start the season under new management.
Former Aberdeen and Dunfermline Athletic midfielder Darren Young is the fresh managerial face with Albion Rovers, replacing James Ward, and the experienced Sandy Clark has become his assistant after his departure from Kilmarnock.
Former Morton manager Allan Moore has taken over at relegated Arbroath after Paul Sheerin joined the coaching staff at Premiership outfit Aberdeen.
George Shields has been confirmed as the new manager of Montrose after ending the season as caretaker following the departure of  while former Scotland defender Lee Wilkie has come in as assistant from junior outfit Lochee United.
Relegated East Fife have also been affected at coaching level, with manager Gary Naysmith losing Robbie Neilson to Hearts as well as experienced assistant Paul Hegarty.
On the playing front, not many have taken a major step up following their exploits last season, the exceptions being Blair Spittal, who left Queen's Park for Dundee United, and Kieran MacDonald, who exited Clyde for Hamilton Academical.
United will be hoping that 18-year-old defender Spittal proves to be as much of golden nugget as Andy Robertson, who made the same journey last season and ended it with the prospect of regularly playing at Hampden in front of thousands for Scotland instead of handfuls for the Spiders.
Ferguson took his time to assess his squad before the re-shaping finally took place with five signings and three exits over the final weekend of the transfer window to add to four earlier additions.
Apart from Arbroath and East Fife, where relegation has led to the typical squad restructuring, it is East Stirlingshire and Queen's Park who appear to have the most significant strides in the summer transfer window so far.
Key signing: John Gemmell is a seasoned campaigner - and goalscorer - at this level and the 29-year-old steps down a division from Stenhousemuir.
