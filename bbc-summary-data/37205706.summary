Police said the 29-year-old man was attacked at the Gorbals venue's Island Bar at about 01:30.
He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital but was released after treatment.
His attacker was white, in his late teens to early 20s, between 5ft 7in and 6ft tall, with short, dark hair. He was wearing a white polo shirt and light-coloured knee-length shorts.
Det Con Lee-Anne Miller, of Police Scotland, said: "The injured man was standing in the bar area when he became involved in an altercation with the suspect which then led to a fight in which he was stabbed.
"Thankfully no-one else was injured but with the number of people about, this could have escalated quite easily.
"We are working with staff from the venue, who quickly stepped in to stop the fight, and we are checking CCTV inside the premises to identify the person responsible for the attack."
She added: "The gig was packed at the time of the assault and a number of people have been spoken to regarding what they saw, however, I am still keen that anyone who witnessed the incident contact police."
