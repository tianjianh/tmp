Carrington netted from close range following Sean Newton's cross in the third minute of added time.
John Rooney and Hamza Bencherif had gone close to breaking the deadlock for Wrexham before Carrington's late winner.
Defeat was harsh on Moors, who suffered their first National League defeat following promotion.
Wrexham manager Gary Mills told BBC Radio Wales Sport: "The result is massive for all of us because after losing you don't want to lose again.
"You want to bounce back and we've done that. As much as it wasn't for the purists tonight, it's a result.
"I'm delighted for everybody and nice to bounce back after Saturday."
