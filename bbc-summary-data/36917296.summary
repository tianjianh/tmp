A coach company is trying to reunite a wedding album with its owners - ahead of their 51st anniversary.

The album of black and white photographs was handed to staff at Birmingham Coach Station.
Staff at National Express believe the couple may have married at St Clements Church at Neyland, Pembrokeshire, on 7 August 1965.
But they added Patricia Cavanagh and Brian Lewis may have married at a Manchester church with the same name.
The wedding album has a well-worn cream cover suggesting it has been thumbed through many times over the years, the company said.
Details of the wedding have been filled in, listing the couple's names, bridesmaids Julie and Christine and best man Derrick.
The bride was wearing a traditional veil and a brocade gown with a pearl trim.
Lost property manager Claire Horvath said: "The photographs of Brian and Patricia are absolutely charming and the wedding looks like such a happy day.
"We don't know who lost the wedding album or why it was being transported but it is clear it must hold huge sentimental appeal to have been carried around after all these years.
"We're really keen to get this album home - wherever that may be - and would be overjoyed for it to be returned to its rightful owner."
