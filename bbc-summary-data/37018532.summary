An Olympic final, a medal ceremony and a marriage proposal - it was some night at Deodoro Stadium.

As the crowds dispersed after Australia won the first women's rugby sevens gold in Games history, Marjorie Enya entered the pitch and asked Brazil player Isadora Cerullo to marry her.
Enya, a 28-year-old manager at the venue, grabbed a microphone and delivered an emotional speech before the couple embraced to applause.
"As soon as I knew she was in the squad I thought I have to make this special," Enya told BBC Sport.
"I know rugby people are amazing and they would embrace it."
Enya said she had not been nervous about popping the question so publicly to her partner of two years, insisting: "She is the love of my life."
Cerullo, 25, was part of the Brazil squad who finished ninth in the inaugural Olympic outing for sevens.
They started as 12th seeds, having only qualified as hosts.
The couple live in Sao Paulo, where Cerullo, who has dual US citizenship, moved to focus on making Brazil's squad for the Games.
"The Olympic Games can look like closure but, for me, it's starting a new life with someone," added Enya. "I wanted to show people that love wins."
