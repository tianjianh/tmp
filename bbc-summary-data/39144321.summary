[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fourth phase of a wind farm straddling the boundary between the Borders and East Lothian is being considered.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It would take the total number of turbines at Crystal Rig in the Lammermuir Hills to over 100.
A briefing note on the latest proposal for a further 11 turbines has been submitted to Scottish Borders Council.
Developers Fred Olsen Renewables said it was an "ideal location" to help meet renewable energy targets.
It said that by the "careful and well thought out design" of the proposed extension it would not add significantly to the "visual presence" of the turbines.
When the original 25-turbine Crystal Rig development became operational in 2003 it was the largest onshore wind farm in Scotland.
Sixty more turbines were completed in 2010 with another six added in the third phase of the project.
