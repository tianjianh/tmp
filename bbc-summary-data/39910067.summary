[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ebbsfleet United and FC Halifax Town have secured promotion to the National League with play-off final victories.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Halifax, who finished third in the National League North table this season, beat Chorley 2-1 in extra-time with a winning goal from Scott Garner.
In the National League South play-off final, 10-man Ebbsfleet came from behind to beat Chelmsford City.
Dave Winfield and Darren McQueen scored second-half goals to book Ebbsfleet a place in non-league's top flight.
After a goalless first half, Halifax went ahead when Kevin Roberts latched onto Jordan Sinnott's through-ball and slipped his shot under Ritchie Branagan.
Adam Blakeman equalised as he bent his free-kick into the bottom corner and the two sides were level after 90 minutes.
The hosts won it on the 100-minute mark when Garner's clever flick nestled into the far corner.
Chorley keeper Branagan nearly equalised in the last minute of extra-time after he came up for a corner, but his spectacular volley went just over the bar.
Ebbsfleet had Anthony Cook sent off for a bad tackle on the stroke of half-time, before Chelmsford went ahead through Bagasan Graham's 25-yard shot.
But the hosts turned the game around with two goals within four minutes of each other in the second half.
Winfield headed in Sam Deering's cross after 72 minutes and Andy Drury's volleyed cross was met by substitute McQueen to return Ebbsfleet to non-league's top flight for the first time since 2013.
