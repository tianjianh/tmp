West Cumberland Hospital: Autumn opening after fire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new hospital building in Cumbria that was damaged by fire will open in the autumn, health bosses have said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fire in January destroyed the biomass fuel plant which would have powered the Â£90m development at West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven.
No final cause for the fire has been established but Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service said there was no evidence of malicious intent.
The site was originally due to open in April.
