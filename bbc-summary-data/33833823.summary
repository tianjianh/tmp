The 36-year-old was attacked outside a shop in Parsloes Avenue, Dagenham at 19:50 BST on Thursday.
Police said he suffered "life-changing injuries", including one knife wound "running practically from ear to ear".
He was taken to hospital where he is in a critical but stable condition. Police are appealing for witnesses.
Police said the injured man was thought to have been in a disagreement with another man in a takeaway shop before the attack.
Det Con Nicola Dunn said: "This is a horrific attack which has resulted in the victim receiving life-changing injuries.
"He has a three-inch slash wound to his neck, a large deep knife wound to his left cheek running practically from ear to ear and a puncture wound to the right chest just below the shoulder. "
The suspect, who left before police arrived at the scene, is described as black, aged about 30, 5ft 10in tall wearing a grey t-shirt, blue jeans and white trainers, police said.
