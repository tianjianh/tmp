The town of Dungog in New South Wales (NSW), Australia has experienced floods before but this time lives have been lost.

The country town, about 215km (133 miles) north of Sydney, was the hardest hit by storms that have also battered other parts of the state.
Dungog sits in the middle of the catchment for a major river system and the town is now flooded by swollen rivers.
Dungog Shire councillor Glenn Wall described a tragedy unfolding in the town where at least three people have died.
"It has been raining for about 24 hours now but in the early hours of this morning it really started coming down heavily," he told the BBC.
"Every river system that we have up here is in severe flood mode," said Mr Wall, who lives in a property in Gresford about 26km from Dungog.
"I have heard that four houses have been inundated and washed away," he said.
"I have real concern about the next 24 hours because there are reports of another storm front coming in from the north."
Dungog has a population of about 2,000 people. Mobile phone and landline connections have been cut off, and the roads into the town are inaccessible.
Mr Wall said he had had trouble contacting people in the town, but had been told by officials that as many as four houses and several bridges and roads had been washed away.
Reports say the three people killed were all elderly - two men and a woman - and were washed away with one of the houses.
"People are used to this kind of thing but not to the loss of life," he said.
"Just about every town and village in the area is isolated [by the rising water]," he said.
He said he had also heard that a bridge to the village of Torryburn had been washed away, isolating about 200 residents.
Mr Wall said when the floods eventually subside, there would likely be considerable livestock losses and damage to fences and road infrastructure.
