The move comes 24 hours after Coulibaly accused Egypt's most successful club of treating him "like a slave".
Coulibaly's arrival in England last week prompted the Cairo Red Devils to lodge a complaint with Fifa, saying he was absent without permission.
But Coulibaly, who played for Kilmarnock in Scotland's top flight during the first half of the 2016/17 season - issued a statement on Twitter, saying he had no choice but to walk out on his contract, which runs until 2020.
They treated me like a slave all because of money
The 22-year-old accused one of African football's most iconic clubs of confiscating his passport and making his family feel uncomfortable practising their religion.
"I had to flee the first chance I had hold of my passport. They treated me like a slave all because of money," said Coulibaly.
Al Ahly have since issued a statement confirming the termination of Coulibaly's contract and vowed to investigate any allegations of mistreatment.
Ahly chairman Mahmoud Taher said: "Ahly totally rejects Coulibaly's allegations; these are all faulty accusations which never happened."
Coulibaly joined the eight-time African champions last January from Kilmarnock and played 12 matches, scoring six goals.
But he claimed his team-mates refused to pass the ball to him and would be willing to accept accept a ban from football rather than return to Cairo.
