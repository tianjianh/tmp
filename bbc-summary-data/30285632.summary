US comedian Bill Cosby has resigned from the board of trustees of Temple University in Philadelphia amid ongoing allegations of sexual assault.

He said he wanted to act "in the best interests" of the university where he studied as an undergraduate.
The resignation comes after several of his Bill Cosby shows have been axed in the US.
The 77-year-old entertainer has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women.
The comedian has not directly addressed the accusations, but his lawyers have described them as "discredited" and "defamatory."
Mr Cosby said in a statement on Monday that he had "always been proud" of his association with Temple University, where he had been a trustee for over 30 years.
"The Board of Trustees accepts Dr Cosby's resignation from the board and thanks him for his service to the university,'' the university said in a statement.
More than a dozen women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, have come forward claiming that Mr Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them.
Some of the accusations date back to 2005 and 2006.
A woman from Florida has also accused Mr Cosby of raping her backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976.
Mr Cosby has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations.
Several broadcasters have decided not to continue projects with Mr Cosby, including NBC and Netflix.
