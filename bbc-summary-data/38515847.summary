Ian Fryer said: "I heard the helicopter landing at about 2pm and then the next minute loads of police arriving, ambulances and I just stood out in the street for a little while with the neighbours looking at what had happened."
Ian Whitworth told BBC Radio Leeds: "I'm completely devastated, completely shocked.
"It's a small road and although we don't know each other intimately we know each other well enough to say 'hi'.
"I can't imagine how awful it must be and I feel terrible for the family."
