The FA People's Cup welcomes male, female and disability players across 16 categories - ranging from under-14s to veterans (over-35s). It also features the increasingly popular walking football, which caters for those who enjoy playing the beautiful game at a slightly more sedate pace.
It is open to established five-a-side teams as well as individuals, so if you have been looking for an excuse to get back into football, this is for you.

The BBC will be following the competition every step of the way - and entrants should not be surprised if they spot a few celebrity teams lining up in opposition. BBC cameras will be visiting different venues throughout to capture the action.
