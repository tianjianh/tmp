[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Piotr Dziurdzik, of Meetinghouse Street in Ballymoney, appeared at Antrim Crown Court on Wednesday.
The 33 charges include 27 of making indecent photographs of children.
Dziurdzik, who worked at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine, was due to go on trial but asked to be re-arraigned and pleaded guilty.
The offences were committed between 2012 and 2015.
The other charges included three of possession of prohibited images of a child and three of possession of extreme pornographic images.
A defence barrister asked for a pre-sentence report ahead of sentencing.
The judge said the defendant will now be subject to notification regarding the Sex Offenders Register.
A spokesperson for the Northern Trust said it is "aware of this case and took appropriate and timely action at the earliest stage to deal with this matter.
"We are also aware that an interim order of suspension has been placed on the doctor's registration by the GMC."
