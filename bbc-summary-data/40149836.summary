After seeing a commotion outside Borough Market's Bread Ahead bakery, where he works, he invited some distressed Brazilian women inside and gave them a glass of water.
When they told him that three men were stabbing people in the market, he headed outside with two crates to tackle the attackers.
Speaking to the Victoria Derbyshire show, he said: "I felt pity for the victims, I didn't know how to handle things or react, I thought to myself I'm also in danger.
"I just threw the crate at [one of the attackers].
"I threw the first crate and I knew he was going to dodge it. While he was dodging it, I walked towards him and hit him in the head with the other crate."
He said a policeman then shouted at him to stand back, before discharging a grenade.
An off-duty policeman - an amateur rugby player - was stabbed after tackling one of the three attackers. He remains in critical condition.
Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick praised the "utterly heroic" actions of the officer, who was taken to hospital in a police car.
She said: "It's hard to pick out individual stories but I am immensely proud of him and what he did."
A British Transport Police officer, who faced the attackers armed only with a baton, was seriously injured but is now in a stable condition.
Chief Constable Paul Crowther from the BTP said the bravery he showed was "outstanding".
Giovanni Sagristani, 38, and his friends were in the El Pastor restaurant on Stoney Street when one of the attackers came in and stabbed a woman in the chest.
"He came in shouting and just stabbed her," he said.
Mr Sagristani's partner Carlos Pinto, 33, who works as a critical care nurse in London, looked after the woman, with the help of his friend, another nurse.
"They took some ice and cloths and tried to stop the bleeding. She lost half a litre of blood in the beginning. He was keeping pressure on the wound," Mr Sagristani said.
He said fellow diners had managed to push the attacker out of the restaurant by throwing chairs and bottles at him. Once the attacker was outside, staff lowered a security gate and locked people inside.
"After the initial moment of panic, everyone tried to help this girl and stay calm. We were all at the back of the restaurant. There were shots going off outside and we didn't know what was going on."
Mr Sagristani said it was more than two hours before the paramedics were able to reach them.
"They kept her conscious. It was very lucky they were there," he added.
Eyewitness Gerard Vowls told the BBC how he tried to stop the attackers stabbing a woman. He threw bottles, pint glasses and chairs at the men.
"I tried to help, but at the end of the day I was defenceless," he said.
A Spanish man used his skateboard to try to defend a woman who was being stabbed by one of the London Bridge attackers.
Ignacio Echeverr√≠a, 39, saw the attack unfolding at London Bridge and rushed to help the woman.
But there is growing concern for Mr Echeverria, who is originally from Madrid and has not been seen since.
According to his father, friends saw the HSBC employee "lying on the floor on the sidewalk after defending someone with his skateboard".
He is reportedly not listed among the dead, not all of whom have been named by police.
Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho attempted to help a bouncer at the Southwark Tavern, who was being set upon by two of the attackers.
The boxing and martial arts enthusiast is in intensive care after being stabbed in the neck.
Footage of him being escorted to an ambulance by police has been posted on the Daily Express website.
In it he is clutching his neck and using his shirt as a bandage.
After the attack Mr Ho wrote on Facebook: "Don't know whether it was stupid or noble to jump in and break up the fight outside the Southwark Tavern, but two a***s trying to do over the lone bouncer on the door isn't happening on my watch."
On Monday the journalist wrote on Twitter that he had been in surgery and was "on the mend".
Consultant at the Royal London Hospital Dr Malik Ramadhan was cycling home after his shift at Accident and Emergency when he sensed something was wrong.
He was cycling south on Tower Bridge, when he noticed emergency vehicles speeding towards the London Bridge area.
"It was clear that something was happening both from the way they were driving and the number of vehicles."
He said: "Given what's been happening, I turned back to work."
When he arrived at the Royal London a major incident had been declared, and on-call staff were ready to treat all of the patients within 30 minutes.
"The 12 were all very badly injured. The people who had been stabbed, had been stabbed with an intent to kill."
Patients were "startled to the point that they couldn't speak".
Dr Ramadhan added that many doctors and nurses are not drinking on the weekends in case a major attack occurs.
Student nurse Rhiannon Owen was at a cash point when a taxi driver shouted at her to run.
"I saw the knife and I didn't turn around again. I just started running as fast as I could," she said.
The 19-year-old, from Cheshire, saw the attacker behind her and ran into Applebee's pub where she joined 30 or 40 others and hid in a stock room.
She said she owes her life to that taxi driver, and appealed for him to get in touch: "You saved my life and you let me go and make sure other people were safe."
Elsewhere, there were tales of generosity as people did their bit to support the emergency services.
Supermarket workers were pictured offering food and drink to police officers on Sunday morning.
A paramedic who was at the scene said the manager of a McDonald's closed the restaurant to the public and gave all remaining food and crates of water to the emergency services.
Paul Ashworth, from Surrey, has been cycling around the London Bridge area giving out water to the police.
"I've just come to give the police some cold water. It's nothing in comparison to what they do. It's just to try and give something back. They're protecting us, saving our lives," he said.
The plumber, who cycled 21 miles from the Surrey border into London, said: "We've just got to keep together - the whole world has."
