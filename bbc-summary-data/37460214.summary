Gateshead 0-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead and Torquay did little to arrest their indifferent form with a drab goalless draw at the International Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It took until the second half for the match to stir up any excitement, as Gulls midfielder Damon Lathrope was forced to head off his own line to keep the scores level.
Minutes later, following Nathan Blissett's handball in the box, keeper Brendan Moore was the Torquay hero, saving a penalty from Danny Johnson.
Both sides were reduced to 10 when Johnson scythed through Ben Gerring, and the latter reacted to the bad tackle with an irate shove.
McGinty came close to winning it for Torquay late on when he struck the post.
