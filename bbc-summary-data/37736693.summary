[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southend United 1-1 Shrewsbury Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manager Paul Hurst started his spell in charge of Shrewsbury Town with a draw at Southend United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The bottom-placed Shrews, who had gone 10 games without a win prior to Hurst's arrival earlier this week, went in front through Adam El-Abd but Stephen McLaughlin's leveller meant the game ended all square at Roots Hall.
Shrewsbury seemed fortunate not to give away an early penalty when Shrimpers striker Marc-Antoine Fortune appeared to be hauled down in the box by El-Abd.
But the experienced defender went unpunished and then took centre stage further up the field when he broke the deadlock in stunning fashion in the 26th minute, firing home an unstoppable half-volley from 30 yards.
Ivan Toney came close to doubling Town's lead almost immediately but his low shot slammed against the left post.
And Southend hit back to equalise in the 39th minute when McLaughlin fired home an excellent through-ball from Simon Cox before the game tamely petered out in the second half with neither side threatening in attack.
