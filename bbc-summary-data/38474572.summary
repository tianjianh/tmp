Lincoln manager Danny Cowley told BBC Radio Lincolnshire:
"They've got players that will be able to run faster than ours, jump higher than ours, be technically more efficient than ours - that doesn't make them better people.
"We've got to make sure that we're as resilient and determined as we've been all year, as together as we've been all year, because we're going to need all three of those qualities if we're going to get to where we want to go.
"For us, success will be, regardless of the score, to have made those Lincoln City supporters proud come full-time on Saturday afternoon."
