Hackney Council is providing temporary office space for up to eight people in the canopy of a tree in Hoxton Square from June.
The idea from the Park Hack community partnership aims to generate more investment in parks and open spaces.
The council said the booking fees would help maintain the park and other open spaces, and community groups could book the space free of charge at weekends.
Groundwork London environmental charity is delivering the project and said between six and eight people would be able to hold meetings or work on laptops in the weather-proof structure, which will be built around the tree.
Workers will be able to see across the square and up into the canopy, as the office will be as "transparent as possible", Hackney Council said.
The tree office has been designed by Australian-American artist Natalie Jeremijenko along with "collaborative artists" Shuster and Moseley, and architect firms Tate Harmer and Gensler.
It will be launched at the biennial 2 Degrees Festival to celebrate art, environment and activism and will be available to book for seven months initially.
A statement on the festival website reads: "This tree offers sanctuary, a power supply, and free Wi-Fi amongst the bustle of east London.
"The workspace is owned and operated by the tree itself, with revenues made being reinvested into Hackney's parks."
