The BBC's network coverage of news from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has improved since 2008, a study published by the BBC Trust has found.

But the research from Cardiff University also suggested the corporation still faces challenges posed by devolution.
The study looked at the number of news stories devoted to the UK nations during certain periods in 2015 and '16.
It also examined the depth of the coverage and the clarity of reporting.
The original BBC Trust report, published eight years ago, concluded that the corporation needed to improve the range, clarity and precision of its network news coverage of the different UK nations.
A follow-up published in 2010 found there had been "significant improvements" but added that some news reports still did not make clear which part of the UK a story referred to.
The latest research looked at the way stories were covered on the BBC as well as on rival broadcasters.
The study found that the BBC had got better at letting audiences know which stories applied only to England or to England and Wales.
It said the BBC made clear a story only applied to certain locations in 78% of cases - which was "a big improvement in recent years and puts the BBC well ahead of other broadcasters".
But the report added: "Issues remained with the accuracy of the way stories were delineated and signalled to audiences."
The research also showed that overall since 2007 there had been an increase in the extent of BBC network news coverage of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Stories from England are still more likely to dominate national bulletins, but the level of coverage from other areas was shown to be well above that of other broadcasters.
In response, the BBC said it would continue to give high priority to reporting the news from across the UK.
It also drew attention to recent initiatives such as the appointment of a Scotland editor and the introduction of a section of the News at Six dedicated to news from the nations.
Richard Ayre, BBC Trustee and chair of the editorial standards committee said: "The Trust's monitoring of the BBC's network journalism during this time has shown some substantial improvements, but devolution rolls on apace - this year alone Parliament at Westminster has agreed to a further transfer of powers to Scotland and is debating greater powers for Wales  - and this represents a growing challenge to UK-wide broadcasters.
"Next year it will be essential for the new BBC board to continue our work and ensure that UK audiences receive BBC news services that best deliver information about, and understanding between, the four home nations."
