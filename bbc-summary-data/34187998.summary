People have been caught urinating in a Hertfordshire alley despite warnings photos would be made public if they did so, police said.

In July, Hertfordshire Police warned they would publish images of those using West Alley, Hitchin as a makeshift toilet.
The force said despite the warning, several people suspected of anti-social behaviour had been caught on CCTV.
"We are being true to our word," a Hertfordshire Police spokesman said.
"[We] have released these latest images in the hope this will help us identify those we suspect could be responsible so we can bring them to justice.
"We hope it will also deter people from behaving in such an unpleasant manner and, if not, we will continue to release CCTV images when necessary."
West Alley is described as a secluded area of the town with homes nearby.
In the last year, residents have reported people using the area to go to the toilet and CCTV cameras also picked up other problems including drug activity, rowdy behaviour and graffiti.
The CCTV images they have released show two groups of men and an individual captured over weekends in August.
Police say they have stepped up patrols in the area and will issue anyone they catch with a fine of up to Â£90.
