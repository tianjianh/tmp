A cat thought to have been trapped for a week after its lead became tangled with a parked motorbike in Edinburgh has been rescued.

The pet was found on Tuesday when a member of the public heard cries at Cables Wynd House in Leith.
The cat, which has been named Molly, is now in the care of the Scottish SPCA's animal rescue and rehoming centre in Balerno.
Molly is between seven and nine months old.
Inspector June Chalcroft said: "Molly was wearing a collar with a harness and a lead so it seems she managed to get herself tangled with the locked up motorbike.
"The concierge of the building heard meowing and managed to locate Molly.
"We think she was there for around a week as she is quite thin.
"If no one comes forward for Molly, we'll find her a suitable new home."
