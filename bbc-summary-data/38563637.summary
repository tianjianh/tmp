Kilmarnock have signed forward Cal Roberts, midfielder Sean Longstaff and goalkeeper Freddie Woodman on loan from Newcastle until the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The three 19-year-olds have mostly featured for United's Under-23 team, although Roberts did make his senior debut in an FA Cup match a year ago.
Longstaff, who plays as a 'number 10', has been a regular scorer for Peter Beardsley's U23 side this season.
Woodman has represented England up to Under-19 level.
He started his career at Crystal Palace before moving to Newcastle's academy set-up in 2013, and has also had loan spells with Hartlepool United and Crawley Town.
Their arrival continues manager Lee Clark's January transfer activity, after extending full-back Luke Hendrie's loan spell while four other players have returned to their parent clubs.
