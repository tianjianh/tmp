[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Â£1m review into the case of a missing woman is to be "scaled-down" from February, police have said.

Claudia Lawrence disappeared on her way to work in York in March 2009. Officers believe the chef, who was 35 when she went missing, was murdered.
Nine individuals have been arrested or interviewed in connection with the case since the review began in 2013, but no charges have been brought.
North Yorkshire Police said the case remained open.

The force said one line of inquiry relating to a DNA profile would take a further six weeks, after which the active investigation would cease.
Miss Lawrence's family has been informed the review had reached its conclusion, the force said.
Assistant Chief Constable Paul Kennedy said: "It is not for the want of trying that a breakthrough has not yet come, but rather the result of the continuing refusal of those who know what happened to Claudia to come forward and tell us the truth."
Mr Kennedy said new lines of inquiry in what was an "extremely challenging and complex case" had been pursued with "vigour and determination".
"The case will not be closed until those responsible for Claudia's disappearance and, we believe, her murder, are brought to justice.
"While the current review team will and has been scaled down, the new Cleveland and North Yorkshire cold case dedicated team will still have responsibility to review any information that is considered relevant," he added.
Martin Dales, who speaks for Miss Lawrence's father Peter, said it was a "depressing day" but the family were grateful for the police's "extremely hard work".
He added: "Someone out there knows what is going on or what was going on and is yet to produce that information.
"Somebody knows something and it is about time that everyone was put out of their misery to find out what has actually happened."
The last contact anyone had with Miss Lawrence, who worked at the University of York, was when she spoke to her mother by phone on the 18 March 2009.
She failed to attend work the following day and was later reported missing.
Det Supt Dai Malyn, who led the review, said: "I acknowledge how sad Claudia's parents and sister feel that we have been unable to give them the answers they want, and everyone in the team shares their frustration.
"We have worked tirelessly for three years and we are sorry that we have not been able to prove what happened to Claudia, or to find her."
