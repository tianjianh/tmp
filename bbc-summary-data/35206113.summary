He fired his shotgun three times towards the intruders, killing Mr Barras, 16.
The case provoked a national debate about the measures homeowners can take to defend their property.
Mr Martin was released in 2003 after serving two-thirds of a five-year sentence.
He was found guilty of murder in 2000, but his conviction was reduced on appeal to manslaughter.
Norfolk police said in a statement: "As part of a planned operation, a 71-year-old man has been arrested in Wisbech this morning on suspicion of possession of an illegal firearm.
"A police search of a property in Emneth Hungate is currently being undertaken."
