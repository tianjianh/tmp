Beulah Print says gay wedding invitations refusal leads to complaint

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A County Louth printing company that refused to print civil partnership invitations for a gay couple has said that a complaint has been made about the decision to the Equality Tribunal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mike O'Leary, of Beulah Print, Drogheda, said that a complaint has been made under the Equal Status Act.
He said it was alleging sexual discrimination.
In March, the company defended its decision not to print the invitations for Jonathon Brennan and John Kierans.
The company said: "We are not against homosexuals, however we do not support same sex marriage, which printing wedding invitations would do."
Drogheda men Mr Brennan and Mr Kierans plan to marry in August.
On Friday, Mr Brennan declined to confirm if the complaint had come from the couple, but said they wanted "to put the issue to bed".
The company's Mr O'Leary said: "We can confirm that a complaint has been received which is now in the hands of the Equality Tribunal.
"The tribunal normally invites both parties to mediation in an effort to resolve the complaint so we expect this to take place shortly."
