Five facts about Icelandic football

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
They are the tiny nation who humiliated England 2-1 at Euro 2016 on Monday. On their way to the last eight of the European tournament, they've also beaten Austria and, in qualifying, the Netherlands, Turkey and the Czech Republic.

Here are five facts about the underdogs who are doing a lot better in France than you might have thought.
Heimir Hallgrimsson works as a dentist as well as co-managing the team. He works on a five square-mile (13 sq km) island called Heimaey, where there are fewer than 5,000 people and millions of puffins.
He'll be taking on the team full-time after Euro 2016.
His co-manager Lars Lagerback is not a dentist, or a doctor, or a postman. He's a full-time football manager from Sweden. He has also managed Nigeria and Sweden - and credits Roy Hodgson, the England manager who stood down after being beaten by Iceland, with shaping his style.
Iceland has as many people as a small English city.
332,529 people, to be precise.
That's about as many as live in the English cities of Leicester, or Coventry. England as a whole has a population of more than 53 million to pick and choose its footballers from.
And this June, 10% of the Icelandic population were in France to support their team at Euro 2016.
If 10% of England's population had gone, France would have had an influx of 5.3 million people.
Or if you were to take the US as an example, 10% of its population would be 32 million people. Imagine that many people leaving the country to cheer on their football team.
Iceland are punching above their weight. They don't have anywhere near as many people to choose from as England do. They have never even qualified for anything this big before. Here is their record in qualifying for recent major international tournaments:
It's cold in Iceland. The average temperature in the warmest month is only 10-13C (50F-55F).
But more pertinently than that, it's dark in Iceland. There are nearly 20 hours of night-time in December. It's not ideal for practising football.
So the country has ploughed money in to indoor facilities for the sport over the past 15 years.
Iceland's football association (KSI) has overseen investment in 30 full-size all-weather pitches, seven of which are indoors, and almost 150 smaller artificial arenas.
Now, people can train all year round - and they get labelled the "indoor kids".
But that's not all.
The KSI's media officer, Omar Smarason, says quality coaching through European football body Uefa has been vital for shaping the country's fairytale.
"You can only do so much with a facility. You have to have capable people," he tells the BBC, his voice hoarse post-match.
"From the age of four, every child has a Uefa-accredited coach."
That started 15 years ago, when Uefa came to the country for the first time.
"A few players on this side are now the product of that. The current team is obviously a good generation."
Hannes Halldorsson was a film director before he turned professional as a goalkeeper.
He directed the video for Iceland's entry to the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest.
Greta Salome & Jonsi performed Never Forget in Baku, Azerbaijan in May 2012, but the song came only 20th in the final.
Iceland has been represented at Eurovision 29 times but it has never won and, therefore, never hosted the competition.
Clips of Gudmundur Benediktsson shouting and screaming as his team netted a last-minute winner against Austria last week have bounded around the internet. His joy is infectious - you can listen here:
But in just a few short days, he left his job at KR Reykjavik. The side has been doing pretty badly - it's lost most of its recent games.
Gummi Ben, as he's known, was back at the microphone on Monday night. Maybe his team's upswing in fortunes will keep his spirits high.
