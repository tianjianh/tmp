Manager Roy Hodgson made six changes to his side from the win over Wales and the move did not come off.
Which players struggled and do any of them deserve any credit?
One anxious second half moment of confusion with Chris Smalling and some routine work, but otherwise untroubled.
A real threat going forward with some good crosses and almost scored in the second half. Had little to do defensively.
Had little to do but what he did was solid and effective.
Same as Cahill. He had that one worrying moment with Hart but was never given much work to do.
Spent too much time going into challenges with his arms in dangerous positions and was deservedly booked. Did not make any sort of case to oust Danny Rose.
Dier is having an excellent Euro 2016. Solid as a rock as the defensive shield but also contributed as England pressed forward and looked like he might even break the deadlock late on.
Looked exactly what he is. Less than fully fit and off the pace after barely any game time for Arsenal last season. A poor selection.
Had a good spell in the middle of the first half but too many poor deliveries and simply not enough quality. Did not take his chance.
Positive opening with good feet, but lacked a cutting edge when in scoring positions.
Started well with some neat touches but then drifted out of the game. Came too deep and was marginalised.
Tireless running and hustling of Slovakia's defence. Should have scored in the first half. His effectiveness was reduced when Slovakia camped on the edge of their own area for the last 30 minutes.
Slovakia were already in base camp on the edge of their own area when he came on. Tried hard but could not fashion a breakthrough.
Almost scored seconds after coming on but still waiting to make his impact on the tournament.
One or two half chances but the pattern of the game was set when he came on.
