[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ross Lafayette scored two goals on his birthday as Dover eased past Woking at the Crabble Athletic Ground.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Whites made light of top-scorer Ricky Miller's suspension as they showed goalscoring potential from other sources in this National League victory.
Mitch Pinnock unlocked the door midway through the first half, crossing for Lafayette to nod his side in front.
Lafayette turned provider shortly after, playing the ball to Moses Emmanuel to score after a deflected free-kick had fallen fortuitously for Chris Kinnear's men.
In the opening exchanges of the second half, Lafayette grabbed his second goal when the visitors failed to clear a Jamie Grimes free-kick.
Gozie Ugwu headed in a consolation for the Cardinals late on.
