Fans welcome home 'inspirational' Team GB

When Team GB's winning athletes touched down at Heathrow they were met by crowds of adoring fans. BBC News met a few of them.

"The sacrifice Joe has put in is unbelievable," said Thaer Al-Shayei as he took pictures of the swelling crowd at Terminal 5.
He was there to collect Welsh boxer Joe Cordina, who was unfortunately eliminated from the lightweight division in Rio at the last 16 stage.
Childhood friends, the pair grew up together in St Mellons, in Cardiff, and even spar together.
"I'm so proud of him; he performed amazing - they all did," said 35-year-old Thaer, who is a boxing trainer and an actor, having appeared in the Welsh comedy series, Stella.
And Thaer's sentiment is one which echoed around the arrivals hall.
A small, dedicated group of fans had gone to the airport just to catch a glimpse of their heroes. Other travellers only grabbed a lucky glimpse between connecting flights.
One person who definitely fits into the former category is father-of-one Ben Brind.
The 38-year-old, from Luton, and his son Arthur were hoping to see the women's hockey team, who won gold after defeating the Dutch in the final.
"They're an inspiration, and their win will boost the sport tremendously," said Ben.
Ben is a hockey enthusiast and has played the game since he was 18. He even met his partner through hockey, while on tour with his team.
"Sport is character building and it can change lives, and that's why we're all here today to recognise the achievements that have been made."
For Ben, other stand-out performances include Andy Murray, Jason Kenny and Laura Trott.
"Murray has definitely won me round, you can't deny he puts his heart into it."
But for 11-year-old Joseph Tassell, who was at the airport to say goodbye to his dad, Nick, who was flying out to Tokyo, Tom Daley was the big name on his lips.
"I was so disappointed he didn't get through to the final," he said.
Joseph, who saw Daley win bronze at the London 2012 games, is about to start school at Southborough High School in Surbiton, and said he liked the camaraderie of the Olympics.
"I like the friendship of it - people of other countries are coming together to play sport."
The fans' support was also recognised by the athletes who spent time signing autographs and posing for pictures.
Doing the rounds were Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge, who claimed bronze in the men's badminton doubles.
"People are just coming up to me and saying 'well done', it's overwhelming," Marcus told the BBC News website.
"It's just so nice to see, without the fans we wouldn't be here. The support has been incredible."
