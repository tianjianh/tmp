Swansea City manager Garry Monk says his side were below the required standard as Watford inflicted a first defeat of the season.

The Swans were unbeaten going into the game and recorded a 2-1 win over Manchester United in the Premier League before the international break.
But Monk accused his side of a lack of focus in the 1-0 loss at Vicarage Road.
"It was a poor afternoon for us and nowhere near the performance levels that we require," said Monk.
Odion Ighalo's second-half strike earned Watford their first league victory of the season after midfielder Valon Behrami had been sent off.
"I think it was a lack of focus on the good things that we do and what we're capable of," Monk added.
"We were sluggish with the ball and we didn't use the ball in the right areas.
"The manner in which we lost it is the most disappointing bit but we always bounce back."
Swansea, who slipped from fourth to seventh in the table after the defeat, host Everton at the Liberty Stadium next Saturday.
