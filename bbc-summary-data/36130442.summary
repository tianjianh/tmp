[SN]TITLE[SN]
Anglesey to welcome 10 Syrian refugee families

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Anglesey council has approved resettlement plans to welcome 10 Syrian refugee families or 30 individuals to the island over the next three years.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The move comes after all local authorities in Wales agreed to participate in the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme (SVPRS).
Families with children of primary school age will be given preference.
Suitable private rented accommodation will be provided in the Menai Bridge and Llanfairpwll areas.
This is due to their close proximity to multi-cultural and religious groups and the mosque in Bangor, health resources and available school places.
Those arriving in Wales under the SVPRS have been classified as vulnerable by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees [UNHCR].
They will have been through a thorough two-stage vetting process before arrival and have been granted five years full humanitarian protection, meaning they will be entitled to work and claim benefits, the same as UK residents.
The scheme is part of the UK government's efforts to support vulnerable refugees.
The first family is expected to arrive in approximately four to six weeks. The council will provide a support plan for each family (or individual) for the first 12 months to help them settle into the area.
Arrangements will also be made for them to attend English and Welsh language classes with an interpreter provided.
