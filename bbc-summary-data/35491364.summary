RSPB buys land at most northerly point on UK mainland

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
RSPB Scotland has purchased land at Dunnet Head, the most northerly point on the UK mainland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The conservation charity had previously leased the 40 acres (16ha) east of Thurso in Caithness.
It has bought the land, which forms the RSPB's Dunnet Head Nature Reserve, with support of a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
The area on the shores of the Pentland Firth provides an important habitat for seabirds such as puffins.
Dave Jones, of RSPB Scotland, said: "Dunnet Head is an amazing place. The views across to Orkney are stunning.
"But for RSPB Scotland what is really important are the breeding seabirds and the opportunity that Dunnet Head gives visitors to see these charismatic birds.
"Many of our seabirds are in serious decline so it is important that their breeding sites are properly protected."
Among the birds to breed at the reserve are puffins, guillemots, razorbills, fulmars and kittiwakes.
