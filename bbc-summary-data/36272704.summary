The site near Westhill is close to the new Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route.
The Dons had been considering a relocation to Loirston, to the south of Aberdeen, a proposal which had been marred by planning difficulties.
Chairman Stewart Milne said Kingsford was "an ideal location for supporters" and that he hoped to move into the new stadium for the 2019-20 season.
Training facilities should be operational by 2018, he added.
The Scottish Premiership club abandoned plans to build at Bellfield beside Kingswells in 2003, which is close to the new site.
The Pittodrie side faced strong opposition back then from local campaigners.
Milne said the next step will be a 12-week period of public consultation, after which initial planning for the training facilities will be applied for, with the outcome "expected later this year".
"Kingsford offers an opportunity to locate both the stadium and the training facilities within a single site, as was the original plan for Loirston, and it is in an ideal location for supporters travelling from all areas in and around Aberdeen," added Milne.
"Crucially, we have full control of the site via a concluded missive with the landowner. Extensive site diligence has already been carried out at Kingsford to establish the feasibility of the land area and also the requirements for the planning process.
"Since Loirston was previously identified as our site for the new stadium, there have been various changes in circumstances and furthermore the development of the AWPR will now provide easy access to the new site at Kingsford.
"AFC and Aberdeen City Council see a new stadium and training facilities as a vital part of the region's infrastructure, and there is a strong desire by the club to deliver these new facilities as soon as possible."
Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes welcomed the announcement, saying it was "fantastic news".
"I've said from the day I arrived here that the one most important aspect where the club needs to drive forward is in terms of its training facilities, so the fact the new stadium is potentially going to be at the same location as these is an added bonus," he said.
"When completed, this will have a huge impact in terms of Aberdeen's ability to attract and then improve players, both in terms of youngsters for our youth academy and also established first-team players."
