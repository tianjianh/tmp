[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Devon and Cornwall Police said the men were hurt when they responded to reports of a man making threats to another resident in Kingsbridge, Devon, at about 17:00 BST.
A 53-year-old man, named locally as Stephen Yabsley, was arrested on suspicion of assault.
Both officers sustained arm injuries and had operations in hospital.
The injuries were said to be non-life-threatening.
Armed officers from the force were involved in negotiations with a man at a house in Retreat Close,  which ended at about 20:30 BST.
A spokesman said they "safely brought the incident to a close". Police said a total of 35 officers were involved in the operation.
The road was cordoned off and people in the "immediate vicinity" were evacuated from their homes.
One of the police officers was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth and the other to Torquay Hospital.
