Campaigners gathered at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay at 13:00 GMT on Friday before marching to the city centre.
The Homes for Wales campaign calls on the next Welsh government to see housing as a key political issue and publish an "ambitious plan".
Campaign supporters include actor Michael Sheen, singer Max Boyce and comedian Rhod Gilbert.
Stuart Ropke, from Community Housing Cymru, said: "The housing crisis is not just about houses - it's about homes, it's about people, it's about communities.
"A home is one of the most basic but most vital building blocks of life and there simply aren't enough affordable homes in Wales for those that need them."
In 2014-15, local authorities reported 2,218 additional affordable housing units across Wales, according to Welsh government figures - a drop of 8% on the previous year.
The total since April 2011 represents 91% of the government's target.
