[SN]TITLE[SN]
Cardiff River Ely pedestrian and cyclist bridge installed

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A new bridge for pedestrians and cyclists will be put in place over a Cardiff river.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is hoped the River Ely bridge, separate from the road bridge, will make it easier for people in the area to walk and cycle.
It is the second phase of a project to improve accessibility along Cowbridge Road East, Cowbridge Road West and in Ely and Caerau.
The Â£290,000 project is funded by the council and the Welsh Government.
Some diversions will be in place over the weekend for the bridge to be installed.
