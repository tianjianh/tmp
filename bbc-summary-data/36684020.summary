County Championship: Jeetan Patel puts Warwickshire on top against Surrey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Warwickshire enjoyed a successful day in the field at Guildford despite Australian international Aaron Finch's stylish century on his Surrey debut.

Sparked by hitting his first ball for six, off Jeetan Patel, Finch raced to 110, slowed only by a brief rain delay.
But Patel's five-wicket haul helped the Bears bowl out Surrey for 273, the last five wickets going down for just 30.
At the close, Warwickshire were 12-0 in reply with Varun Chopra seven not out and Andy Umeed unbeaten on three.
After Surrey had won the toss, opener Rory Burns made 45 before being trapped lbw to become the first victim for Patel (5-62).
At 79-2, that brought in Finch, who then plundered his 110 from just 98 balls to move Surrey on to 243-5.
But, once he had been smartly taken by Surrey old boy Rikki Clarke, off Patel, the hosts lost their last five wickets in little more than half an hour.
Both sides are searching for only their second four-day win of the season and, if the weather holds, a result looks likely.
Surrey batsman Aaron Finch told BBC Radio London:
"I can't think I've hit my first ball for six before, other than in a one-day game. I remember doing it in a T20 international.
"One of my things as a batsman is to be as positive as you can, and to take it on if the ball is there for the shot - whatever ball it is you're facing. Luckily, I got away with it this time.
"It's obviously nice to get a few in my first innings for Surrey, although I'd have liked to have got a few more.
"I reckon we've got a pretty decent score on that pitch. We battled hard for a lot of the day before losing wickets quickly towards the end. There's something in it for the bowlers if they get it in the right area."
