Gary Rowett wants permanent Burton Albion job

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Burton Albion caretaker manager Gary Rowett wants to prove he deserves the job on a permanent basis by building on his side's two-match unbeaten run.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rowett guided Albion to a first win in 17 games when they beat Gillingham, and they drew 0-0 with Crawley on Saturday.
It was only the AFC Wimbledon game where we let ourselves down but we learnt an awful lot from that
Rowett, who took over from Paul Peschisolido in March, told BBC Radio Derby: "It's about getting results.
"I'd love to get to the position where the results were that fantastic, it was an obvious choice [to appoint Rowett]."
He added: "In the two weeks [since Rowett took over] - and two weeks is not a long time to try to get your ideas across - what you have seen is a defensive change. That's the quickest thing to try and change.
"We would like to be more creative and that is something we are working towards.
"But what you have seen is an improvement in the last two games, and against Northampton.
"It was only the AFC Wimbledon game [lost 4-0] where we let ourselves down but we learnt an awful lot from that."
