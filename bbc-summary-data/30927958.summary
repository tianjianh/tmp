The 16-year-old midfielder signed a contract with the Champions League winners after passing a medical exam.
"It's a dream come true," he said. "It is a bit unreal that I'm here at the biggest club in the world. It's huge for me, an honour."
Odegaard will train with both the first team and the reserves but play for the second string, who are coached by France great Zinedine Zidane.

Real have not disclosed details of the financial terms but Spanish media report they have paid about 3m euros (Â£2.3m) for the Stromgodset player.
Odegaard told the media that the move to Madrid represented the best opportunity to "develop as a footballer" and said there was "no pressure" on him.
He added: "My goal is to become a better footballer. Playing for the first or second team is not so important."
"It's a dream come true. It is a bit unreal that I'm here at the biggest club in the world. It's huge for me, an honour."
Odegaard made his debut for Norway as a 15-year-old in August and had been linked with many of Europe's top clubs.
Odegaard came to prominence last year when he became the youngest player to appear and score in the Norwegian Premier League.
He scored five goals and contributed seven assists in 23 appearances for Stromsgodset.
The teenager is left-footed and has drawn comparisons to Barcelona's Lionel Messi for his style of play.
Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti has previously described him as "a kid with talent and personality".
