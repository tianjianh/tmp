[SN]TITLE[SN]
Plans for 350 homes in Bangor rejected

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans to build 366 houses in Bangor have been rejected over concerns the development would harm the Welsh language.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors also felt local schools and infrastructure could not cope with the additional homes in the Penrhosgarnedd area and that it would constitute over-development in the city.
The proposal had been recommended for approval by Gwynedd council officers.
But the planning committee voted by 6 to 5 to reject the application.
A planning report said the application on land at Pen y Fridd had attracted "a substantial number of correspondence and a petition" with concerns ranging from an impact on traffic to a lack of capacity in nearby schools.
