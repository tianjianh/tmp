[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Callers to the 999 number on Friday were diverted to mobile phones within ambulance control in Belfast or to Scottish Ambulance Service staff, who then relayed the calls on.
During the disruption, 117 emergency calls were received.
The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said the fault had been resolved.
A spokesman for the ambulance service said: "We are confident, at this stage, that all calls requiring a 999 response were received and dealt with appropriately.
"The system has been re-booted and monitored for a period of time to ensure full functionality."
