East Sussex Healthcare Trust 'likely' to be put in special measures

A third hospital trust in the South East is expected to be put into special measures, the BBC understands.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
East Sussex Healthcare Trust which runs the Conquest Hospital in Hastings and Eastbourne District General Hospital is currently rated as "inadequate".
However, BBC South East Today has learned the trust has failed to improve and is likely to be placed into special measures at a meeting on Friday.
The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment.
The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust.
Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department.
The East Sussex trust was rated as "inadequate" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets.
In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management.
And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street.
Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a "disconnect between the trust board and it's staff" and a "culture where staff were afraid to speak out".
The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right.
It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months.
Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust.
A spokesman for the trust refused to comment on whether it would be put into special measures.
He said: "We are waiting for the publication of the CQC report next week and until it is published and they have made any recommendation we are unable to make any further comment."
