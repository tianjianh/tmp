The specimen, almost 5ft (1.5m) long and weighing 50lb (22.6kg), was put on show at Swansea Market at the weekend.
Fish-stall owner Adrian Coakley-Greene said: "It is a real giant beast. We tied it from a girder on the roof because it was so big."
The halibut was bought by Morgan's Hotel in the city to serve up to customers.
