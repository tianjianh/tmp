A teenager who nearly died from meningitis has shared photos of her rash-covered body in an attempt to raise awareness of the disease.

Charlene Colechin, 18, described how her organs failed, causing her "to die" until doctors managed to save her.
The hair stylist, from near Chesterfield in Derbyshire, has been in hospital for a month and spent nine days in a medically induced coma.
She still faces surgery to remove her toes and possibly her feet.
Speaking from Sheffield Hospital, Miss Colechin said she felt lucky to be alive.
"I was screaming because I was in that much pain," she said.
"I kept throwing up, then I had a really bad headache like a migraine, and all my body was aching."
Miss Colechin had bacterial meningitis - which is rarer but more serious than viral meningitis.
She said she had been vaccinated, but the jab did not protect against the type of meningitis she had.
Claire Donovan of Meningitis Now said the rash on Miss Colechin's body would have been caused by septicaemia, which some people get as a result of certain meningitis bacteria.

Paramedics were called out on 6 September but thought the teenager had flu because she did not have any marks.
However, her condition worsened and marks appeared the following day, when paramedics rushed her to hospital.
"Within minutes I was on a drip in the ambulance on the way to Chesterfield Hospital," she said.
"I was in a coma for nine days because all my organs were failing.
"I did die but obviously they brought me back."
She is now waiting for tests to see what parts of her feet will need to be amputated.
"My heels are black," she said. "That could mean dead tissue, which could be infected and which could go up my legs."
She hopes that sharing her photos will prevent other people from suffering the life-changing effects of the disease.
