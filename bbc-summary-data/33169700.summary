The pet charity PDSA says there's a big increase in pets being diagnosed as clinically obese in the last two years.
Being overweight can cause health problems for animals. It can lead to heart disease, cancer, diabetes and arthritis.
The charity's now running a six week Pet Fit Club to help animals lose weight and fat.
It will also teach owners how to feed their pets more healthily.
