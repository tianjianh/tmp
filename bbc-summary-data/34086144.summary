[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Scottish security expert who worked for multi-national companies and the Royal Family of Oman has been jailed for five years for firearms offences.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
William Cavanagh, 47, was caught stockpiling weapons parts at his home in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire.
The haul included components for AK47 and AR15 assault rifles.
Cavanagh was caught after a parcel from a US gun firm was intercepted and it was found he did not have a firearms licence. He later admitted 15 offences.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Burns said the case did not meet the required "exceptional circumstances" to merit a lesser sentence.
The judge said: "I'm not satisfied that lack of knowledge in your particular circumstances would amount to 'exceptional circumstances'.
"Moreover it seems to be a case of wilful blindness. You are a person who clearly has an interest and knowledge of firearms.
"Furthering business enterprises seems to be outwith the scope of exceptional circumstances."
The court heard that Cavanagh bought the gun parts over the internet and had them shipped to his home in Airdrie.
He was caught after the UK Border Force intercepted a parcel in June 2014 addressed to him from a major American weapons firm.
When police were alerted to the delivery, they discovered Cavanagh did not have a firearms licence, and subsequently raided his home.
Among his stash were parts for AK47 and AR15 rifles, as well as a single-shot pistol, and a 4.5mm revolver.
The 47-year-old claimed he was building a ballistics testing range to find materials which could be used for home protection in conflict zones such as northern Iraq.
The qualified engineer said he was motivated to find protective building materials to sell through his security firm after seeing the injuries inflicted on people by ISIS.
Cavanagh claimed he only bought the pieces to try out a clamp for holding guns at his planned testing range.
He said he had no idea it was illegal to own parts of firearms that could not shoot and said he was going to apply for a firearms licence in due course.
Cavanagh pleaded guilty to 15 firearm charges during an earlier hearing in Glasgow in June.
