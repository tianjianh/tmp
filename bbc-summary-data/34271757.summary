Up to 300 riders are expected to take part in the Lowther Hills Snowball Sportive, which starts in Scotland's highest village, Wanlockhead.
They will cycle up the Mennock Pass, one of the UK's tallest climbs, before a mountain top finish at Lowther Hill.
It has been organised by the south of Scotland's only ski club, to allow them to buy a snowgroomer vehicle.
Lowther Hills Ski Club chairman Anjo Abelaira said the community-owned club needs Â£10,000 for the equipment.
He wants to develop permanent ski facilities at Wanlockhead and Leadhills.
In the Snowball Sportive, participants will climb a 611m (2,004ft) vertical ascent over 15.2km (9.4 miles) before finishing at Lowther Hill.
Event director Alan Anderson said it reflects a surge in popularity of the Lowther Hills as the outdoor capital of the south of Scotland.
"The event's routes feature some of the most dramatic scenery in the south of Scotland and our longest route takes on six major climbs on the course, including three of the toughest in Scotland: Devil's Beef Tub, Talla and Lowther Hill.
"We envisage the event going from strength to strength in the coming years, becoming a very popular event and delivering great benefits for the local area."
It will be staged on 4 October.
