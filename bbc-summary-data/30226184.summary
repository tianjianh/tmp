An Australian TV presenter has sold a suit he wore every day for a year for A$6500 (£3,500).

Karl Stefanovic wore the outfit to make a point about the sexism he said his female colleagues faced.
Nobody noticed he was wearing the same blue outfit, but he said his co-presenters would never have got away with it.
The profits will go to the charity White Ribbon, which campaigns to end violence against women.
He sold it on Ebay with the warning that "it's a little bit stanky (sic)" and added it "may need dry cleaning ASAP".
47 people bid for the suit and the lucky winner will get free delivery, meaning they should have cash spare to give it a good clean.
It was sold by the TV channel Karl works for with this description:
"Karl Stefanovic wore this stunning navy Burberry suit on The TODAY Show for one whole year to make a point about sexism. You have the chance at purchasing this suit for yourself, imagine how good you'd look in it! Super comfy, super stylish, super cool".
The 40-year-old, who has been a presenter and reporter for nearly two decades, has also participated in a variety of celebrity game shows in Australia, including Dancing on Ice and Hole in the Wall.
When he revealed that he wore the same outfit for a year he told The Age newspaper that his co-host, Lisa Wilkinson regularly gets messages from viewers and comments in the press about her fashion choices.
"Women are judged much more harshly and keenly for what they do, what they say and what they wear," said Stefanovic.
"I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour - on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is."
He started his experiment by wearing the suit two days in a row, without a comment. He then carried on for days and then months when he realised no-one was noticing.
"Only Lisa and [Today team member Sylvia Jeffreys] know about the suit. They often remark that it's getting a bit stinky," said Stefanovic.
"I'm hoping to get it into the dry cleaners at the end of the year."
