The Vauxhall Astra they were travelling in struck a tree when it left the Cladymilltown Road on Thursday morning.
Paramedics were called to the scene of the crash at 08:30 GMT.
The 17-year-old boys studied at the Southern Regional College in Armagh.
A third boy who was in the car was injured.
He is in a stable condition in hospital.
The three boys, who studied fabrication and welding, were on their way to Portadown in County Armagh to take part in a skills competition when their car left the road.
Brian Doran, the chief executive of the Southern Regional College, said staff and students were in shock after hearing of the boys' deaths.
"It's an absolute tragedy. We are deeply saddened and our sincere condolences go out to both families and to the third student that survived the accident," he said.
In September, two young students at the same college were killed in a car crash near Rostrevor in County Down.
"It's a repeat of the tragedy that struck us then," Mr Doran added.
"It's something that you cannot get over, we're all traumatised."
Police said the victims were the driver of the car and the front seat passenger.
The car has now been removed from the scene and the road has been reopened.
John McPoland of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said "two rapid response paramedics, two A&E crews and a doctor" were sent to the scene when the crash was reported.
A forensic team is trying to establish how the crash happened.
Democratic Unionist Party MLA William Irwin said "the whole community will be shocked".
"Almost every other day we're hearing about young people being killed on our roads," he said.
"This morning two young lads lost their lives and one was injured on their way to technical college.
"My thoughts and prayers will be with the families involved."
