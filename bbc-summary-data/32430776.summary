Crime figures show there were just over 180,000 crimes recorded in 2014, including 20 murders, 40,000 violent offences and 4,000 sexual offences.
The majority were in the South Wales Police force area, which includes Cardiff and Swansea, which saw a 7% rise.
Gwent Police saw a 5% rise while Dyfed-Powys and North Wales were unchanged.
The Office for National Statistics said improvements meant more crimes reported to police were being recorded.
