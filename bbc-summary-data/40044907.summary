Second referendum vital for our children, say Lib Dems

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second referendum is needed before Britain leaves the EU in case the exit deal "wrecks the future for our children", Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Mark Williams has said.

The party launches its Welsh manifesto on Friday and said the referendum was "at the heart" of its proposals.
Mr Williams said voters should have the option to reject the deal and remain in the EU if they do not like the offer.
He will be joined in Hay-on-Wye by ex-deputy prime minister Nick Clegg.
The Lib Dems said the manifesto plans for a stronger Wales in a fairer UK.
"A bad Brexit deal, with Britain outside the single market, will wreck the future for our children, our economy and our schools and hospitals," Mr Williams said.
He added: "Our plan comes from a strong, open and tolerant Wales, where our children have the best start in life, where people are decent to each other and where our economy works for everyone."
The party says its manifesto, entitled "Change Wales' Future", will "make clear our aspirations for Wales in devolved matters and is a plan for a stronger Wales in a fairer United Kingdom".
At the 2015 general election, the Liberal Democrats won one seat in Wales.
