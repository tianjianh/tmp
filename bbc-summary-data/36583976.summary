No arrests were made as good-natured partying went on in the city until the sun rose on Tuesday morning.
Aaron Ramsey, Neil Taylor and Gareth Bale each found the net to take Wales through to the final 16.
The supporters' group is meeting Uefa officials to discuss ticketing issues for the next game in Paris in Saturday.
Wales are still waiting to learn which opponent they will face in the Parc des Princes stadium in the French capital.
Paul Corkery from the Football Supporters' Federation Cymru told BBC Wales that, at present, fans needed to have a voucher with their name on it to exchange for tickets in Paris and warned them not to buy vouchers off touts or other fans as they would not be able to exchange them.
He said: "The portal will reopen for tickets that are being returned, which is a difficult process in itself, especially over a few days.
"The problem we have is you'll get England fans now offering their vouchers to the Welsh fans, and unless the England fans can physically get to Paris and exchange their vouchers for tickets and then sell those tickets, that's fine, but a voucher is worthless until you exchange it for tickets.
"We are looking into it with Uefa. We're having a meeting with them today."
He asked fans looking for tickets to "sit tight" for a few days.
For those in Wales looking to go out to Paris on Saturday, Cardiff Airport said it was still working on plans for what they expected to be a busy weekend.
Cowbridge-based Strachan's Sports Travel said they were chartering a flight from Cardiff to Paris's Charles De Gaulle airport on Saturday and had sold 110 seats so far.
A spokesman told BBC Wales the size of the aircraft chosen would depend on the number of seats sold, with a planned departure time of 11:00 BST and return at 23:30 local time.
"We have more than one option for aircraft," he said.
"We're getting calls every two minutes."
Gullivers Sports Travel, the Football Association of Wales' official travel partner, are also offering bus travel only from Cardiff, Swansea and Wrexham.
Following the game, goal-scorer Bale said the performance was "the best I've ever been involved in since I've been here".
Social media lit up following their emphatic victory, with players, pundits and fans alike sharing their joy online.
Former Wales internationals Robbie Savage and John Hartson, both pundits at the Euros, posted a video of themselves in a taxi singing what has become the unofficial anthem of the tournament, "Don't Take Me Home".
