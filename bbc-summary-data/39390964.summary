[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Tranmere Rovers briefly went top of the National League with victory in the early kick-off at Wrexham.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Mickey Mellon's side secured their fourth consecutive league win courtesy of young defender Olly Marx's first half own goal.
Rovers' win saw them replace Lincoln as leaders, although the Imps beat Bromley later in the day to return to the top.
Dean Keates' Wrexham have gone five successive league games without a win.
Jeff Hughes had gone close with a free-kick for Rovers before the visitors went ahead when 18-year-old Marx turned Lee Vaughan's shot into his own net on his home debut.
Tranmere were in control and home keeper Chris Dunn denied Vaughan and former Wrexham midfielder Jay Harris.
Ex-Dragon Connor Jennings' header was cleared off the line by Marx in between Rob Evans and Jordan White both firing over the crossbar for the hosts.
Heavy rain made conditions difficult in the second half, but Cole Stockton and James Norwood had chances to extend Tranmere's lead while Dunn saved from Liam Ridehalgh.
Wrexham pushed for an equaliser, but substitute Izale McLeod's scuffed close range effort and Ollie Shenton's shot over the bar summed up the home side's afternoon.
Wrexham manager Dean Keates told BBC Radio Wales: "On another day I think we could have nicked a draw.
"In the last 20 minutes we grew into it and obviously the same in the second half when in the last 20 minutes e pushed them right back and had a good go at them.
"But in the first 25 minutes of both halves we didn't ask enough questions."
