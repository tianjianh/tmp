Stephen Cook: South Africa batsman joins Durham as overseas player

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Durham have signed South Africa batsman Stephen Cook for the first half of the 2017 season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
He has joined as an overseas signing, rather than on a Kolpak deal.
The 34-year-old will play in the County Championship and One-Day Cup games and then is expected to be included in the South Africa squad to face England in their four-Test series this summer.
Cook has played nine Tests for his country after his debut against England in January 2016, when he hit a century.
"Ever since I was a young boy, watching my dad (Jimmy Cook) play for Somerset, I always dreamed of one day playing county cricket," he said.
"Now in linking up with Durham I am getting to live out that dream."
Durham were relegated from Division One of the County Championship over financial issues last season and will start the campaign with a 48-point deduction.
