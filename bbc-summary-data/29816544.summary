Show producers issued a statement saying, "James Argent is currently suspended from filming and won't appear in this week's episodes".
Some of today's newspapers are blaming his love for partying but a source told Newsbeat his punishment is a result of "persistent lateness".
There's no confirmation on how long the suspension will go on for.
It comes after a bit of an turbulent summer for Arg.
Back in August his agent was forced to issue a statement saying he was "safe and well", after police were looking for him when he went missing for a few days.
It turned out that he had gone to the wrong airport.
He was also escorted off a plane for being too drunk when series went on location to Ibiza in September.
