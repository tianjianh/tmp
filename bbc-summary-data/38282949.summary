Finn Russell has urged Glasgow Warriors to take another step towards achieving their European ambition by repeating Saturday's win over Racing 92 when they meet again on Friday at Scotstoun.

Warriors boosted their chances of making the Champions Cup quarter-finals for the first time with a 23-14 win over the French champions in Paris.
Russell said: "A big focus for us this year was trying to qualify in Europe.
"If we manage to back this up we'll be in a good situation in the group."
Coming off three Pro12 defeats in a row, Glasgow produced an inspired display to deliver arguably their best ever European result and Russell says the win will give the squad a shot of confidence to take into the final three pool matches.
"It was a great result, a great team performance," he said. "In terms of the competition it keeps the qualifying position still alive. This result away from home has definitely helped us. It was a big game for us.
"We knew how tough this game was going to be. They were runners-up last year and won the French league last year as well so they're a world class team. We knew how good they could be.
"What for me was so impressive was how well the boys played and how they stepped up to match and take on Racing.
"It was brilliant for us as a team to do them over and look onto next week after winning here."
Russell, 24, delivered a man of the match display in Paris, an achievement made all the more impressive by the fact his opposite number was a man considered by many to be the greatest fly-half ever to play the game - Dan Carter.
The Glasgow man says he did not give too much thought before the match to winning his personal duel with the New Zealand legend.
"It wasn't a case of trying to out-play my opposite man," the Scotland fly-half told BBC Scotland.
"Obviously you know who he is and that he's a world class player, but it's not in the back of your mind or you're worrying that you've got to over-perform to try and equal him.
"I went into this game knowing what I had to do and my job for the team. I wasn't focusing on trying to play better than him.
"If you start looking at things like that then you start making mistakes and start trying things that aren't in your game to try and out-play your opposite man. For me it's more just do what I need to do for the team and it helped me a lot having the boys play so well.
"I got good ball, was on the front foot and everyone was switched on so that helped me a lot. It was a pretty mature performance from quite a young team I thought."
