A former head of drama at ITV Wales, he was the first chairman of Ffilm Cymru Wales, the agency promoting Welsh film and drama across the world.
He helped develop drama in the early days of Welsh broadcaster S4C, including the hit series A Mind to Kill - Yr Heliwr, starring Phillip Madoc.
He was also one of the launch directors for the BBC soap EastEnders in 1985.
The chair of S4C Huw Jones said Mr Edwards was "incredibly talented".
"He had a strong commitment to film and to the efforts to develop and promote Welsh and Welsh-language films," said Mr Jones.
"He believed that films held a deeper worth than purely entertainment, and that it played an important role in building and defining a nation and society."
Pauline Burt, the chief executive of Ffilm Cymru Wales added: "He is a man who cared deeply and dedicated his life to getting unheard voices heard, both in-front of and behind the camera.
"He was a personal support to the team here and to many, many writers, directors, producers, actors, crew, friends and family, and he will be deeply missed."
His career spanned four decades, and as well as pioneering the back-to-back filming of A Mind to Kill in Welsh and English, he had producer credits on the iconic Welsh drama The District Nurse and the classic comedy series Satellite City.
ITV Wales described him as a "giant of the industry".
"Peter will be remembered as a passionate advocate for Welsh drama and for the Welsh independent sector. Our deepest sympathy goes to his family," said joint acting head of news and programmes, Jonathan Hill.
