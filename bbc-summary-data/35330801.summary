Bury took the lead early on when Clarke capitalised on James Wilson's inability to deal with Danny Pugh's high ball and fire home from close range.
Oldham keeper Joel Coleman denied Clarke a second, before Andrew Tutte fired a volley just wide.
The home side piled on pressure after the break, but Bury's Ian Lawlor pulled off two smart saves to secure the win.

"I know they're going to give me effort, but effort's not good enough is it?
"We've got to create opportunities because we've got to score goals to win games.
"It's hard for the supporters, I know it is. We look vulnerable"
Bury manager David Flitcroft told BBC Radio Manchester:

"Extremely proud of a fantastically battling performance.
"It's been difficult on the road over the last month to six weeks.
"It was always going to be a tough game but our fans really diffused that."
