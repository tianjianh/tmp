Craig Peacock scored after 26 seconds to give Britain a great start and Russell Cowley netted either side of an Aleksandr Petrov strike.
Petrov and a late penalty from Telford Tigers' Andrei Makrov forced overtime.
But Sheffield Steelers' Dowd sealed the points and a second victory after the opening game win over hosts Croatia.
Great Britain next face Lithuania on Wednesday in the six-team tournament. Britain are in division 1B and the winner will gain promotion to division 1A - just one step away from the elite teams, such as Sweden and Canada.
Head coach Pete Russell said: "It was not pretty but we found a way to win the game.
"It shows the spirit of the squad in that we did not panic and found a way to claim the extra point.
"We can now rest our bodies and start preparing for Lithuania on Wednesday."
Seth Bennett, ice hockey commentator
This was a tough game where GB didn't hit the highs of the opening night win over Croatia, but they had to find a way to win - which they did.
There will be areas of concern for head coach Pete Russell, but he will be happy with the two points and his side able to live to fight another day.
The equation remains the same for GB - five wins guarantees them a gold medal and promotion to world ice hockey's second tier, but with Lithuania, Romania and favourites Ukraine still to come, that will be no easy task.
