Mark Lawrenson's Premier League predictions

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.

This week he takes on Charlotte Green, the former Radio 4 newsreader, who made her debut reading out the classified football results on BBC Radio 5 live and the World Service on Saturday.
Green says it was a pleasant surprise when she was asked to take over from James Alexander Gordon.

"I was absolutely delighted," Green said, who supports Tottenham.
"It is something I always dreamed about as a child. When I was six, I used to sit at the kitchen table and read them out loud, much to the annoyance of my sister who thought it was all terribly boring."
And her debut on Saturday predictably passed off perfectly.
A correct result is worth ONE point. A correct score earns THREE points.
Last week, Lawro got four results right, with one perfect score. His score of six saw him beaten by superstar sprinter Usain Bolt, whose six correct results with two perfect scores gave him 10 points, and put him second on the guest leaderboard.
