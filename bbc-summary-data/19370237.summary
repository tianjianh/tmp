Damian Rzeszowski, 31, stabbed his wife Izabela Rzeszowska, 30, his daughter, Kinga, five, and son, Kacper, two, in St Helier on 14 August last year.
As well as his wife and children, Rzeszowski also killed Marek Garstka, 56, Marta De La Haye, 34, and her daughter Julia De La Haye, aged five.
He was found not guilty of murder by the Royal Court in Jersey, but had already pleaded guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility.
Izabela Rzeszowski was born in Bydgoszcz, northern Poland, and moved to St Helier to join her husband in 2004. They were married a year later.
Her family said their hearts were broken "when the hearts of six wonderful people stopped beating".
In a statement they said: "This tragedy is even more painful as we have lost our children and grandchildren.
"Knowing that we will never be able to play with Kinga and Julia again or cuddle little Kacper and we can never talk to Izabela, Marta or Marek again makes the pain unbearable.
"A day does not pass when we do not think about our loved ones and our memories of them bring tears to our eyes."
Mrs De La Haye's husband Craig said: "My life, and the lives of many families, have been devastated since then. Every day is a struggle to continue, and yet it still feels like yesterday that it happened.
"My beautiful wife Marta and wonderful daughter Julia, friends Kinga, Kacper, Isa and Marek, you will never be forgotten.
"Not a day goes past when I don't think about my family. I hope that one day I will see you again, until then... I love you."
Mrs De La Haye's mother, Tamara Jaciubek, said nothing would ever be the same without her daughter and granddaughter.
She said: "Finding the strength to carry on each day without them proves to be a continuous struggle.
"Every day I ask myself why? A question that will never be answered."
Mrs Jaciubek also thanked the Jersey community, saying it was wonderful how the island gathered together and showed compassion.
She said: "The financial help the good people of Jersey donated meant I was able to bring my only child and only grandchild back to Poland, something I will be forever grateful for."
Det Supt Stewart Gull was the senior investigating officer and said his thoughts were with the families of the victims.
"We can only imagine the grief of the families, who lost their loved ones in such brutal circumstances.
"But today is not a day for vindication or celebration, but sad reflection," he said.
