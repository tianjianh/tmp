The project has seen the capacity of Allonby's wastewater treatment works doubled, United Utilities said.
A new underground storage tank has been created to capture more storm water and reduce sewer spills.
Ultraviolet equipment that kills bugs has raised the quality of the treated wastewater which is returned to the sea, the firm added.
Allonby, on the Solway coast, was rated "poor" in 2015 under European standards known as the revised Bathing Water Directive.
