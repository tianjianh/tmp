The 29-year-old had a year left on his previous deal and has made 92 appearances for Posh since joining in July 2014 after leaving Leyton Orient.
He has recently returned to training after missing the last part of the 2015-16 season with injury.
"He is one of the best keepers in the league in my opinion and I am pleased he has signed," said boss Grant McCann.
