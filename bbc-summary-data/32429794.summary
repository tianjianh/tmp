[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The historic bells at Orkney's St Magnus Cathedral are being turned to spread gradual wearing caused by being rung.

A team of engineers will lift them off their giant timber stocks and turn them 180 degrees.
The bells - last turned in the 1980s - date back to the 16th Century.
Cathedral custodian Fran Flett Hollinrake said: "Obviously we want to keep them in the best condition possible. It is quite a big job."
The Romano-Gothic cathedral, built from red and yellow sandstone, is of international significance.
The foundations were placed in 1137, and the building, dedicated to Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney, took about 300 years to build.
It was assigned to the inhabitants of Kirkwall by King James III of Scotland in a charter dated 1486.
It was announced earlier this month that the 12th Century cathedral in Kirkwall was to undergo a laser scan as part of efforts to preserve the building.
