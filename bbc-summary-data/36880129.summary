One-Day Cup: Leicestershire break duck by beating Lancashire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Mark Pettini and Mark Cosgrove just fell short of centuries as Leicestershire broke their duck in this season's One-Day Cup competition.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Foxes thrashed Lancashire by 131 runs at Grace Road after posting a total of 307-8 in their 50 overs.
Skipper Pettini (92) and Cosgrove (91) shared a third-wicket stand of 140 to lay the foundation for a big total.
Tom Smith made 56 off 58 balls for Lancashire, but Neil Dexter took 4-22 as they were all out for 176.
Leicestershire's first victory in six games lifted them above the Red Rose county - who only lasted until the 40th over - and off the bottom of the North Group table.
Their total was only five runs short of their previous List A best against Lancashire - 312-5 in the 1995 B&H Cup.
Pettini hit nine fours in a fluent 99-ball innings, but fell lbw to Smith (2-49) with a century there for the taking, and Cosgrove was equally impressive before he fell to Leicestershire old boy Nathan Buck (2-55).
Lancashire began their run-chase well with Smith and Alviro Petersen (24) putting on 74, but once they had gone, Liam Livingstone (28) was the only other batsman to pass 20.
South African Dieter Klein marked his debut with two late wickets as the last five went down in five overs for just 14 runs.
