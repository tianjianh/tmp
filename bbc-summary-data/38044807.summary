Glasgow hosts cross border amputee football contest

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scotland's first cross border amputee football tournament has taken place in Glasgow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amputees from the across the UK took part in the contest at Springburn Park.
Teams included Everton Amputees FC, Manchester City Amputees FC, UL Sport (Ireland) Amputees and Scotland's only amputee football team, Partick Thistle.
The Amputee Football Association Scotland (AFAS) was set up recently with the support of the Scottish FA to promote the sport.
Partick Thistle Community Trust offers fortnightly coaching sessions at the club's Firhill complex and with players travelling from as far afield as Dundee, Dumfries and Galloway and Edinburgh to train.
A video of the star player in the Partick team, Tommy McKay, went viral last week after he scored a goal at Tannadice.

Supporters of the initiative include Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill who visited Firhill to coach the players during the summer.
Ashley Reid, of AFAS, said she hoped other Scottish clubs would support the setting up of amputee teams.
She said: "The training at Partick Thistle has been a great success and taking the sport to other SPFL clubs is the natural next step in building a league in Scotland.
"We have been appealing to anyone with a lower or upper limb amputation or limb difference to come and give it a try at the tournament."
