Police are hunting a group of men after a nightclub doorman suffered a "terrifying" attack when he refused them entry.

He was hit with a machete outside Rock Zombie in Dudley, West Midlands, and had what is believed to be a firearm pointed at him.
He was saved from serious injury by body armour, West Midland Police said.
The men were refused entry in the early hours of Christmas Day due to being intoxicated.
They then turned on staff after and kicked and punched the doors of the club and threw rocks before fleeing, police said.
Three men returned about an hour later, at 02:20 GMT, in what was described as a silver Vauxhall Astra with alloy wheels.
Police said one of the men brandished what appeared to be a firearm and chased the doorman, pointing it at him and pulling the trigger.
"The 25-year-old victim understandably feared for his life but was uninjured," a spokesman said.
"Another of the men produced a large machete and struck the doorman twice with it, hitting him so hard the weapon broke."
Det Ch Pete Miller, from West Midlands Police, said they then left the scene in the car and he urged anyone who saw anything to contact police.
"Rock Zombie is a reputable club, the doormen are there to protect the revellers and to ensure that everyone has an enjoyable and safe night out," he said.
"It is unacceptable that when they are simply doing their job and refuse admission to people who are too drunk that these people should react so disproportionately.
"It is by sheer good luck that no serious injury was caused to anyone."
