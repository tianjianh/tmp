Fundraisers are trying to raise £250,000 to restore the 400-year-old former school in Bampton, Oxfordshire, depicted in the series as Downton Cottage Hospital.
About £70,000 has been donated already but it is hoped getting stars like Hugh Bonneville on board will boost the bid.
Mr Bonneville urged viewers to give a "little tiny bit".
Campaigner Robin Shuckburgh, who runs a Downton Abbey tour through Bampton, said if a further £70,000 could be raised it opens up the possibility of getting the remainder through grants.
Mr Bonneville previously told the BBC: "When the locals of Bampton told me last summer that this place, that we had slightly taken for granted, was beginning to really face some serious problems... I thought the least we could do was shout about it.
"If every viewer of Downton gave a little tiny bit then we could save this building for the future."
Bampton is also home to other familiar locations from the programme such as St Michael and All Angels Church, Mrs Crawley's House and The Grantham Arms.
