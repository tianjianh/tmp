[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two detectives have been disciplined after police failed to properly investigate rape allegations against a man who went on to murder a woman.

Lee Nolan strangled Katelyn Parker, 24, with her own hair straighteners after she called him "gay" in August 2015.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now found "significant failings" in the way police handled previous allegations against Nolan.
Detectives from Greater Manchester and Kent police received official warnings.
The IPCC said Nolan was allowed to "remain at liberty" and went on to kill Ms Parker in Heywood, Greater Manchester, despite two unrelated allegations of rape and one of making threats to kill.
The watchdog found the threats to kill allegation was not progressed by either police force.
There was confusion over which force would investigate the complaint as Kent Police thought Nolan had been in Manchester at the time, but Greater Manchester Police were unaware of this.
Two separate rape allegations were also subject to "severe delays and poor communication", the IPCC ruled.
The detectives were found to have cases to answer for misconduct and were subject to "management action".
In February Nolan was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum sentence of 18 years.
Rachel Cerfontyne, deputy chairman of the IPCC, said a "lack of organisation and inadequate communication" meant "grave offences" were not investigated.
"While it is impossible to know the full consequences of this failure, we do know that Nolan remained at liberty and went on to commit murder, albeit unrelated," she said.
"It is essential that forces have protocols in place which ensure effective policing nationwide. I strongly recommend an urgent review of current policies and practices and will be taking this forward with relevant policing bodies."
