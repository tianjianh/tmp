[SN]TITLE[SN]
Fishing boat runs aground on Loch Ness beach

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A fishing boat has been towed off a beach on Loch Ness after it ran aground on Thursday evening.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Loch Ness RNLI went to the aid of the 5.5-tonne boat after it got into difficulty at Dores, south of Inverness.
The Inverness Coastguard Team assisted in the operation to pull the vessel off the shore and a lifeboat towed it to Dochgarroch.
There was one person on board the boat. He was uninjured.
Fishing boats use the loch when travelling between Fort William and Inverness.
The latest "shout" was Drumnadrochit-based Loch Ness RNLI's 24th of the year, making 2016 the volunteer-run station's busiest year so far.
