In fact, he's "so mad" with a mother in the US, he tweeted: "I'm burning my Florida mom action figure in protest."
It's her petition - aimed at the shop Toys R Us - that has got the Breaking Bad actor fuming.
Susan Schrivjer is calling for the toy retailer to remove all the Breaking Bad character action figures from sale in store and online, because they are a "dangerous deviation from their family friendly values".
She says the figures, some of which come with "a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth" are not suitable to be sold alongside "Barbie dolls and Disney characters".
In response to all the press attention her campaign has received, Cranston, who played Walter White in award-winning drama, tweeted his own message of "protest".
Since the petition got notice, Toys R Us appears to have removed the Breaking Bad dolls from sale on their US website.
They were priced at $17.99 (Â£11.10).
However, some of the figures, including a couple of White's sidekick Jesse Pinkman, are still appearing in the "trending" and "recommended for you" parts of the site.
In a statement sent to Newsbeat, Toys R Us said: "We carry a variety of fictional character action figures, including those for our collector customers.
"The products you reference are carried in very limited quantities in the adult action figure area of our stores."
In a US statement, they also said that the Breaking Bad packaging "clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up".
Schrivjer, who used the surname Myers to launch her petition online, has received more than 5,000 signatures of support so far.
