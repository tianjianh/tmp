[SN]TITLE[SN]
Perranporth man fined for not picking up dog mess

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A man who refused to clean up his dog's mess on a beach has been ordered to pay almost £2,000.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kevin Watch, 68, failed to clear up after his dog at Perranporth on the north coast of Cornwall and refused to pick up the mess when challenged.
He also refused to give his name and address, but the dog warden who witnessed the offence tracked him down.
Truro Magistrates ordered him to pay an £800 fine with £1,000 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.
Cornwall Council, which brought the prosecution, said the case "sent a clear message" to dog owners.
When the council learned the man's identity, he was issued with an £80 fixed penalty notice which was not paid and the matter went to court.
Watch, of Hendrawna Lane, Bolingey, pleaded not guilty to one count of being in charge of a dog and failing to remove faeces.
Following the case, heard on Wednesday, Allan Hampshire, head of public protection at Cornwall Council, said dog fouling "blighted" lives of residents.
He said: "This fine sends a clear message to the small minority of irresponsible dog owners that if you don't clear up after you dog, the courts will fine you accordingly."
