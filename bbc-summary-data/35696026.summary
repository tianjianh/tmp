[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dunne, 23, joined the Seasiders from Wycombe Wanderers in 2013 and has made 30 appearances for the club.
"Left-back has been a bit of a problem for us since Mitch Hancox and George Smith went back to their parent clubs," boss Mark Yates told the club website.
"He played a lot of Championship games last season and he's a solid and competitive player."
