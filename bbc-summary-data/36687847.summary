The Chinese pairing of Gong Jinjie and Zhong Tianshi had set a world record of 31.928 seconds in their semi-final.
China were denied gold four years ago at London 2012 after being disqualified and relegated to silver.
Australian Anna Meares, looking for a medal at a fourth successive Games, missed out on bronze with partner Stephanie Morton, losing to Germany's Miriam Welte and Kristina Vogel.
It is the only track cycling event without a British entry, with Jess Varnish and Katy Marchant failing to qualify.
Varnish was subsequently dropped from the GB squad and her accusations of sexist remarks from former technical director Shane Sutton have led to an inquiry within British Cycling.
