Sweden's Zlatan Ibrahimovic: I've sent Denmark into retirement

Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he has sent Denmark "into retirement" after scoring twice to seal Sweden's Euro 2016 place at the expense of their neighbours.

The 34-year-old scored both of Sweden's goals in a 2-2 play-off second-leg draw in Copenhagen - a result that gave them a 4-3 aggregate win.
The striker has hinted he could quit international football after Euro 2016.
"They said they were going to send me to retirement," he said. "I sent their whole nation into retirement."
Paris St-Germain player Ibrahimovic - who also recently claimed to have put both Sweden and France "on the world map" - has now scored 62 goals in 111 appearances for his country.
His goals on Tuesday - a scuffed finish from a corner followed by a curling 25-yard free-kick - ensured that even two late goals from the 1992 European champions were not enough to deny the Swedes a place at the France finals.
"If I have to finish with a Euros, then that's destiny," added Ibrahimovic. "Thanks for all the support and see you in France. There's still a few months [before it begins] but we'll be there."
The play-off defeat also signalled the end of Morten Olsen's 15-year reign as Denmark coach.
