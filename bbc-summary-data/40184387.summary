Fans have donated almost £8,000 to help a British band arrested in Hong Kong over alleged visa offences.

Oxford musicians TTNG was held after a raid by police and immigration officers on a warehouse venue in the Kwun Tong area in May.
According to the band's Facebook page, their bail has been extended to 17 July.
Since returning home a crowdfunding campaign has raised £7,650 to pay for further plane fares to and from China.
The band said it was "truly grateful for the compassion and understanding" shown by fans.
Under Hong Kong immigration law, the band could be charged with working without the required permit, while concert agency Hidden Agenda could be charged with hiring the bands as illegal workers.
Both offences can be punished with prison sentences and hefty fines.
A Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesman said: "Our staff continue to advise and support several British men following an incident in Hong Kong in May."
TTNG, formerly known as This Town Needs Guns, were part of the UK's noughties math rock scene which also included fellow Oxford band Foals.
