Last year's Man of Steel Zak Hardaker has been placed on the transfer list by Leeds Rhinos.

The Yorkshire club have put a Â£300,000 valuation on Hardaker, a key member of the Rhinos' treble-winning 2015 season.
The club have agreed to allow the 24-year-old to leave after he revealed he wanted to play in Australia's NRL, with Canberra believed to be among the favourites to sign him.
Leeds sit bottom of this season's Super League after 17 rounds.
Hardaker joined Leeds from Featherstone in 2011 and scored a try in the Rhinos' Grand Final victory over St Helens later that year.

He has since scored 67 tries in 154 appearances for Leeds, winning three Super League titles, two Challenge Cups, the League Leaders' Shield and World Club Challenge.
"I explained my desire to leave and test myself in the NRL to Gary [Hetherington, Rhinos chief executive] several weeks ago and I am pleased the club is prepared to release me," Hardaker said in a statement on the club's website.
"I have had five great years here and have had so many wonderful times. I will continue to help the team whilst I am here but I am also excited with what the future may hold for me."
Rhinos head coach Brian McDermott said: "Zak is a special talent and a fierce competitor who will do well wherever he plays.
"We won't be quite the same without him, but we've come to this decision and he will leave with our best wishes."
The England international's expected exit follows the departures of Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Kylie Leuluai and Paul Aiton from last season's all-conquering squad.
