'Be aware' ice weather warning for Wales

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' weather warning for ice across Wales on Monday evening and Tuesday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Met Office said showers will fall as rain, sleet and hail at low levels, but as snow over hills, where several centimetres of snow may accumulate.
The warning is valid until 10:00 GMT on Tuesday.
Motorists have been warned to expect "difficult driving conditions". It comes just days after Wales was battered by 94mph winds.
