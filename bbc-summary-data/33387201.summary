A Jersey politician missed the handover of the Dance World Cup to the island when he flew to Budapest, Hungary, instead of Bucharest, Romania.

Jersey is hosting the 2016 competition and Constable Steve Pallett was due to receive a flag from the current hosts.
Mr Pallett apologised to event organisers and said he was sorry for wasting some Â£1,000 of taxpayers money.
He said he did not realise he was about 500 miles (804km) short of his destination until just before landing.
The booking was made by someone within the Education, Sport and Culture department and a spokesman said it was "human error".
The last time the event was hosted in the UK was in Brighton in 2013.
Mr Pallett, assistant minister of both the Economic Development and Planning and Environment departments, said: "It is really disappointing, I have to apologise for wasting taxpayers money and for letting down the dance world cup.
"I don't know the exact cost as I've still got some figures to come back, but it won't be less than Â£1,000 and the department should have been more careful when it was booked.
"All I can do is apologise for what is a schoolboy error, the last thing I needed was a day trip to Budapest after a long week supporting the Island Games."
He was supposed to make a speech and accept the flag on behalf of nearly 3,000 competitors from 32 countries, including England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Mr Pallett said he did not realise he was going to the wrong place as he trusted the right booking had been made for him.
He had been heavily involved in the Island Games, a multi-sport competition similar to the Olympics, that was being held in Jersey the week before.
