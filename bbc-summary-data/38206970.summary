Hull City Council said the 1km closed loop road, which is being built next to Ennerdale Leisure Centre, would be safe for cyclists to use away from traffic.
Two ponds are also being created as part of the design as well as a car park and a bike hire facility.
A ground breaking ceremony at 12:15 GMT is marking the official start of construction on the project due to be completed by August 2017.
Councillor Terry Geraghty said: "The new circuit... will help meet increasing demand for road racing in the region, offering a fantastic facility for training sessions, races and other events including competitions all year round."
The six-metre wide circuit is being funded by British Cycling and the council.
