Playing in a Mumbai Cricket Association XI, left-armer Willey removed Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Chris Jordan with the last three balls in England's 177-8.
The hosts replied with 163-6 as James Vince, another England player, made 45 at the Brabourne Stadium.
England start their World T20 campaign against West Indies on Wednesday.
Willey, who finished with 3-35, Vince, Adil Rashid and Jos Buttler played for the hosts as England used their second practice match to give all 15 members of their squad a game.
Rashid took 2-32 with his leg-spin, dismissing Jason Roy for 32 and fellow opener Alex Hales for 37.
Root supplied valuable late impetus with 48 off 34 deliveries, after Ben Stokes fell for 30 to spark a collapse of five wickets for 15 runs.
"There were a few verbals around as you'd expect, mostly from Jos, but it was just good fun," said Root.
Jay Bista led Mumbai's reply by hitting Jordan's first delivery for six on his way to a rapid 51, while Vince threatened to pull off a shock win as he struck four fours and a six in his 38-ball innings.
It was not until Jordan bowled Buttler for 25 with an inswinging yorker in the penultimate over that England's victory was assured. He finished with 2-34 and Reece Topley 2-26.
In Monday's other warm-up match in Kolkata, Pakistan beat defending champions Sri Lanka by 15 runs thanks to Imad Wasim's 4-25.
England - World T20 champions in 2010 - chased 170 to beat New Zealand by six wickets in their first warm-up match on Saturday.
Root said: "The guys have stepped up and performed under pressure.
"That's exactly what we need if we are to be very successful at this tournament. Now it's about doing it when it counts.
"The best thing is we've got these experiences to call on when the tournament starts and we're actually under real pressure when it really matters."
