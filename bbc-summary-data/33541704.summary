Tata Steel workers agree pension deal to end strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An industrial dispute at Tata Steel has ended after workers voted to accept changes to their pension scheme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Unions had won backing for strike action after the firm proposed closing the final salary scheme, which Tata claimed was facing a Â£2bn deficit.
Workers have now agreed to amendments to the pension scheme in return for it remaining open.
A proposed national strike scheduled for 22 June was suspended following talks at the arbitration service Acas.
Neither the unions nor Tata have given any details of the changes.
In a statement Tata Steel said the new proposal was "a fair and balanced solution".
The firm added; "The new arrangements, including the modifications to scheme benefits, will address a significant proportion of the pension scheme's projected deficit. "Other actions to be agreed with the pension Trustee will address the balance."
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, one of the four unions involved in the dispute, said the UK steel industry was still facing "challenges".
"It was apparent during this dispute that the company was not listening to the concerns of its workforce, which led to a serious breakdown in trust and confidence," he said.
"All unions have already begun a dialogue with the company to address these issues."
Tata Steel employs more than 17,000 people in its UK operation.
It has sites in Corby, Hartlepool, Rotherham, Scunthorpe, Teesside and York as well as plants in Port Talbot, Newport, Flintshire and Carmarthenshire.
