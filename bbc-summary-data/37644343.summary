The youngster made headlines this month when making his debut for the Scottish champions' development team.
"We didn't want to kick him because he is still so small," said in-form striker Dembele, no relation.
"He is a good talent but we have to wait and see how he will improve as a player."
The older Dembele has netted 12 goals since his summer move to Celtic from Fulham and has been keeping last season's top scorer Leigh Griffiths out of the starting line-up.

"There is no number one or two," said the 20-year-old, who was picking up the Premiership player of the month for September award.
"I am a striker. Each time the manager gives me a chance, I give my all for Celtic.
"This was the next step for me after Fulham. I had to show I could do it at a high level with a massive club.
"From my first day, the lads have made me welcome. In an environment like this you settle quick and that has helped me score goals."
