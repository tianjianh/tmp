[SN]TITLE[SN]
Dumfries Whitesands flood protection plan agreement reached

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A major river defence scheme for the flood-prone Whitesands in Dumfries has taken a significant step forward.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Councillors have agreed to formally publish the plans and adopt them as a flood protection scheme.
The cost of the project has risen to £25m from previous estimates of between £15m and £17.8m.
The Scottish government would meet 80% of the bill with Dumfries and Galloway Council required to find the remaining figure of about £5m.
The plans have faced criticism over the loss of river views and a reduction in car parking spaces.
However, the council said it had tried to address those and the investment would provide flood protection and create a "high quality public open space".
