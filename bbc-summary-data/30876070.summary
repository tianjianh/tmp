Mark Ronson: New album caused 'nerve rashes'

Mark Ronson says he was suffering from a "little bit of a musical identity crisis" before he started work on new album Uptown Special.

The process of recording the songs in 2013 and 2014 also caused him to break out in "nerve rashes".
"My hands were covered in these great red welts," he told Newsbeat.
Thankfully the rashes didn't last, and only erupted during a particularly stressful week when the track Uptown Funk had to be finished.
It was also the same week Ronson was scheduled to give a high-profile talk for global ideas organisation TED about how sampling transformed music.
He needn't have worried.
Ronson's TED talk was well received and has been viewed more than 1.6 million times online, while Uptown Funk you could say has done more than OK.
According to data compiled by the Official Charts Company, there has been more than two million streams of the song every week since it went online last December and it's been number one in the Official Singles Chart for five weeks.
Mark Ronson also now holds the record for having the most streamed single of all time in the UK.
Uptown Funk was streamed 2.56 million times in the week ending on 4 January.
Sounds profitable already, and that's before the album was even released. Ronson admits, though, that he has "no idea" how much money he makes from streaming, before sheepishly admitting, "I should really know, I should ask someone".
So why was Ronson feeling anxious before cracking on with Uptown Special initially?
"I think it had been a couple of years since my last record," Ronson explains. "I had been working with Bruno [Mars] on Unorthodox Jukebox."
"I'd been working with Sir Paul McCartney and I was thinking of ideas and I was DJ'ing a lot of festivals around that time.
"I was always DJ'ing the same tents and line-ups with people whose production I really enjoyed but it was probably more banging-drums-of-doom style stuff than what I was doing, and I was thinking like, 'Oh am I going to make a hip-hop record?'
"So I was messing around with that for a while and I didn't quite know what I was doing and I was having like a little bit of a musical identity crisis."
His solution was to just get on with working, so he went to Venice Beach in Los Angeles with friend and colleague Jeff Bhasker who co-produced and co-wrote Uptown Special.
"And I just started writing," Ronson says. "I spent time at the piano, which I hadn't done in a while.
"And maybe something about being in California, and the songs started coming out, stuff that was interesting and seemed unique, like not a lot of other stuff like it around, which is always what I'm looking for when I start something."
Mark Ronson then enlisted highly-respected author Michael Chabon (Wonder Boys and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Klay) to help write the lyrics on the album.
He also got together a bunch of other musicians to work on various songs, from Bruno Mars on Uptown Funk, to Mystikal, Miike Snow's Andrew Wyatt and Kevin Parker from Tame Impala.
Ronson even managed to achieve that rare feat of aligning schedules so that most of the contributors on the album de-camped to Memphis for recording sessions together.
He recalls working in one room of the studio and "all I can hear is loud music and glasses clinking and drinks being drunk from the next room", and Mystikal and Bruno Mars "come out and they had the verse and first chorus of Feel Right".
"Lovely, magic moments would be happening," Ronson remembers.
Ronson's pulling power even succeeded in getting his musical hero Stevie Wonder to record a harmonica section for the album, which Wonder recorded on a rare day off in Chicago last year.
After all the time and effort he put in, Ronson hopes Uptown Special does get listened to as an album, and that it's not all about his number one single Uptown Funk.
"People do get their music and listen to it however they want now and I'm no different," says Ronson.
"But I think when something comes along and you kind of believe it's an album, you believe it was meant to be consumed that way, then that's the time when I care enough to listen to something from start to finish.
"The album as a format may not be what it once was, but it's the only complete version of our art form as musicians and people that create music that we have, so I think I'll always feel some kind of thing for it."
