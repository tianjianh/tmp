Britain's Kyle Edmund handed Australian Open spot

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
British number three Kyle Edmund has been handed a place in the main draw of next month's Australian Open following Richard Gasquet's withdrawal.

The 20-year-old was three spots outside automatic qualification when the entry lists were released earlier this month.
But Frenchman Gasquet, the world number nine, has pulled out with a back injury.
It follows the earlier withdrawal of Argentina's Juan Monaco and Australian youngster Thanasi Kokkinakis.
Edmund, who is ranked 102 in the world, came through qualifying in Melbourne this year before losing to American Steve Johnson in the opening round.
He thought he had done enough for automatic qualification this year but missed out after five players used protected rankings to gain places at the year's first Grand Slam, which starts on 18 January.
Edmund was part of the Great Britain squad which beat Belgium last month to win the Davis Cup for the first time in 79 years.
