[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Substitute Sergio Araujo scored a late equaliser for Las Palmas as Real Madrid failed to win for the second successive game.

The visitors took the lead through Marco Asensio's header after Nacho's shot was saved by Javi Varas.
Their advantage lasted five minutes before midfielder Tana equalised for the Canary Islanders with a low finish.
Karim Benzema restored Real's lead three minutes after coming on, only for Araujo to earn the hosts a point.
Real would have gone three points clear at the top of La Liga with victory but their lead is now just one point after failing to win for the second game.
Barcelona had earlier won 5-0 at Sporting Gijon to temporarily replace Real at the top of the table.
Relive the action from Las Palmas
Araujo's equaliser five minutes from time summed up Real's night as Sergio Ramos and Kiko Casilla got in a tangle, allowing the substitute to run the ball into the net.
Las Palmas' players celebrated wildly at the final whistle while the visitors, for whom Cristiano Ronaldo was substituted, were left to wonder how they had twice allowed the lead to slip.
After winning 16 La Liga games in succession, Real have dropped four points in a week and must regroup before facing Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in Germany on Tuesday.
With one eye on midweek, as well as a number of injuries, manager Zinedine Zidane rotated his squad.
Nacho came in for the injured Marcelo at left-back, and Toni Kroos was pressed into service as the holding midfielder with Casemiro out.
But with Alvaro Morata joining Gareth Bale and Ronaldo in attack, Real should have had enough quality to see off their opponents.
However, Ronaldo was far from his best and looked unhappy as he was replaced by Lucas Vazquez five minutes after Benzema had made it 2-1.
Another concern for Zidane was his side's defending - Real have managed just two clean sheets in their past seven La Liga and Champions League games.
While Ramos and Casilla will not want to see replays of the home team's second equaliser, Raphael Varane's poor headed clearance led to Tana's well-taken goal.
Las Palmas were spirited throughout and are fifth in the table, four points behind leaders Real.
