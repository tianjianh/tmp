The stand-in captain faced 535 balls across two innings, moving from 174 not out overnight to end 219 not out in Surrey's first-innings score of 483.
Following on, he then made 68 in Surrey's 166-3 to keep Hampshire at bay and prompt handshakes at 16:50 BST.
The draw sees third-placed Hampshire claim 12 points, while Surrey take 10 points and stay sixth in Division One.
Burns' epic effort saw him stay in the field for all but 10 overs of the entire match, as he defied Hampshire's bowling efforts on a flat Oval pitch.
The left-hander was dropped twice in the slip cordon in his career-best 219, but was the only one to resist as Ian Holland (3-37) dismissed Tom Curran (53), Amar Virdi and Mark Footitt to force the follow-on after Surrey began the day on 410-7.
Mark Stoneman (47) and Burns then put on an opening stand of 109 before Holland's medium pace had Stoneman lbw and Scott Borthwick bowled in a single over.
Sean Ervine became the only man to dismiss Burns in 756 minutes of play when he missed a ball down the leg side, but Jason Roy and Dominic Sibley continued on until the conclusion.
Surrey captain Rory Burns told BBC Radio London: "I'm really pleased that we've fought that hard to get the draw and the extra five points, and obviously pretty happy with how I've played.
"We had to bat seven sessions to get us to safety and that's all I was thinking.
"There were some jitters in the nineties and I got a lifeline, which was quite nice. When I was getting close to 200, I was more thinking about the situation of getting to the follow-on mark.
"They're a good side and they played really well. We managed to hold on and get ourselves to safety, so it was honours even on a flat wicket."
