[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
George Cooper and Harry Davis goals earned Crewe Alexandra their first win in seven League Two matches as they beat Leyton Orient at Brisbane Road.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Despite having the greater possession in the first half, Orient failed to test Alex goalkeeper Ben Garrett and paid the price when the home side found themselves two goals down at the interval.
The visitors incisive football at the business end of the pitch proved decisive. On 34 minutes, Jens Janse sent his intended clearance straight into the path of Cooper who struck the ball into the top left corner of the net from 12 yards.
Two minutes later, Crewe were only prevented from doubling their lead when Tom Parkes cleared a shot from Alex Kiwomya off the line but on-loan Chelsea midfielder Kiwomya was to feature in the second goal.
He sent in a sublime cross from the left to the unmarked Davis who was left with the simplest of close-range finishes to extend his side's advantage.
Only an outstanding save in added time from keeper Alex Ciask prevented Billy Bingham from adding to the Railwaymen's lead.
To compound to Orient's misery, winger and substitute Ulrich Nnomo was stretchered off with a leg injury just 16 minutes after joining the action leaving the home side to play out the final few minutes with 10 men.
During the second half, a section of the Orient crowd calling for president Francesco Becchetti to quit the club and the home team left the field to a chorus of boos from the Brisbane Road faithful.
