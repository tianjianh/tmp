Glasgow toy bank helps cash-strapped families

As they struggle out of the cold and into the new Community and Beyond Toy Bank in Govan, there's a warm welcome for Beatrice Caddell and her daughter Lynn.

They're laden with Christmas bags, overflowing with toys.
Beatrice has just celebrated a very special birthday. And rather than gifts, she asked her friends and family to donate to the toy bank instead.
"Aren't I lucky? 80! I don't want to say it, but 80 years of age," smiled Beatrice.
"I don't need anything. I've got a good home, good husband, good family, and we're well looked after. So what was the point in them buying me stuff? I mean, there's stuff in that wardrobe I think I've had since I was about 15. But somebody else can benefit from it."
The toy bank, based at 905 Govan Road, has been set up by volunteers, and will work with local community groups and food banks to find parents who need help.
Organiser John Beattie says locals are concerned about the growing number of people who are using food banks.
"People are really struggling this Christmas financially," he said.
"We have seen explosions in the numbers of people using food banks, and if people are struggling to feed themselves and their children, then they're going to have quite a poor Christmas, so we're really here to support those people.
From baby dolls to dinosaurs, Tonka trucks to teddy bears; the toys are starting to pile up. And as long as they are in good condition, they don't have to be brand new.
"This is the problem we have in our house," says John. "I've got an eight-year-old, and every year we have a clear-out before Christmas, and some of the toys are in perfectly good working condition.
"So that's the idea, that's why we set up a wee bit earlier - to catch people who will be having clear-outs of their kids previous toys."
The toy bank operates in Govan, but aims to help parents across the south of Glasgow - hence the name Community and Beyond.
Parents who are worried about the extra cost of Christmas can contact them directly, or through the local food banks.
They will be asked what age and sex their children are, and what sort of toys they would like to wake up to on Christmas morning.
Claire McCunnie is a development worker at the Glasgow South West food bank, and says she knows many mothers who could use some help.
"Once they pay their bills they just don't have enough to stretch, and obviously with Christmas coming up, that just makes life worse," she said.
"It just means they know their kid will get something, and that's all mothers want. They just want to give their children as much as they can. They want to feed their kids, and they want to make sure their kids have something on Christmas Day. And that's why this is fantastic."
And with her 80 years of experience, Beatrice Caddell agrees. "As you grow older, and you think about the past, about what you've done for them, how you've brought them up. As long as they're OK, we're OK. It's as simple as that. You never stop being a mum and dad."
As they sort through the donations, the volunteers put them into piles according to age and type. They will be cleaned, wrapped up, and delivered from mid-December.
It's hoped all these toys can be found a good home for Christmas.
