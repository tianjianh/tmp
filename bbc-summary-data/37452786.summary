Spain Burg wins under Frankie Dettori, beating Fair Eva at Newmarket

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
French filly Spain Burg beat odds-on favourite Fair Eva to win the Rockfel Stakes at Newmarket.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Frankie Dettori sealed a double on the 14-1 shot, a first British win for trainer Xavier Thomas-Demeaulte.
Fair Eva, a daughter of legendary racehorse Frankel, failed to win for the second time in a row, having finished third in the Lowther Stakes.
Dettori also won on 11-8 favourite Journey, who took the Nayef Stakes for a second successive year.
Journey finished three and a quarter lengths clear of Lady Of Camelot in a 1-2 for trainer John Gosden.
But Dettori was denied a treble as Nathra finished third in the Joel Stakes behind 15-2 winner Cougar Mountain, ridden by Ryan Moore for trainer Aidan O'Brien.
