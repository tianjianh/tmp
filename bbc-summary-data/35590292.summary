[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lisburn Glass Group Ltd shuts with 30 job losses

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
About 30 workers have been made redundant at a window manufacturing firm in Lisburn, County Antrim, after it was placed into administration.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Lisburn Glass Group Ltd was established in 1971 and operated from a factory in the Blaris industrial estate.
Gareth Latimer and Stephen Tennant of Grant Thornton have been appointed joint administrators.
Mr Latimer said: "The business has ceased trading and all employees have been made redundant."
He added: "We have been working with the directors since the start of the year and reviewed the options available, but creditor pressure has increased, leaving the directors with no alternative but to seek the protection of an administration appointment."
The administrators will be "carrying out a sales process in order to maximise value for creditors".
On its website, Lisburn Glass said that during its 45 years in business it had "developed a national reputation in the industrial and commercial glazing market".
It added it was "involved in major contracts throughout the UK and Ireland", manufacturing and supplying products from its 40,000 sq ft factory.
