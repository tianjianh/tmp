[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 0-1 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Carl Baker kept Portsmouth's League Two title hopes alive with the only goal of a tense game at play-off chasers Mansfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The midfielder turned Krystian Pearce to grab the winner after 57 minutes, the ball taking a deflection off Conor Chaplain on its way in.
The home side dominated the first half without troubling Pompey goalkeeper David Forde.
Mansfield were furious with referee Lee Swabey three minutes after the break when last man Matt Clarke brought down Danny Rose when he looked clean through, but was only booked.
The Stags also had a goal disallowed when Rhys Bennett was judged offside, before Baker struck just six minutes later
Mansfield piled on the pressure and wasted two golden chances as Alex MacDonald headed across goal before Matt Green lobbed over the bar when one-on-one with Forde.
Kal Naismith wasted a late chance to kill the game when he lifted over from six yards, but it didn't matter in the end.
The defeat leaves the Stags relying on other results to secure a play-off place on the final weekend, while Portsmouth are third, two points adrift of leaders Plymouth.
