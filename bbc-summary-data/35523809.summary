The high winds of Storm Imogen caused police in Dublin to issue safety advice to some confused, feathered residents of the city.

Rescue missions had to be mounted on Sunday night after some swans began landing on water-logged roads.
Among those helped back to the safety of the Grand Canal was a disorientated swan on the Naas Road in Inchicore.
Police said after it was summarily detained it was released "without much of a flap".
Another of the confused birds was captured at Wood Quay in the city after it thought it had landed on a swan lake.
It was wrapped in a Garda high visibility jacket and released "to be with other swans".
No charges followed in either case.
The Garda took to social media to get the message across to other swans that they'd really be better not taking to the roads.
"High winds of Storm Imogen playing havoc with local swans, they're landing on wet roads thinking they are rivers," the Garda tweeted.
"We advise swans not to go chasing waterfalls and to please stick to the rivers and lakes they're used to."
It's not known how many swans saw the tweets, or shared them with the city's ducks and geese, but no more rescues were reported.
