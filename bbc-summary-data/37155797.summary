[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former lord provost said she had decided to call it a day after 33 years at The City of Edinburgh Council.
The 60-year-old said it was time for the younger generation to come forward.
It follows City of Edinburgh Council leader Andrew Burns' announcement last week to also stand down at next year's local elections.
Ms Hinds said: "I will have been 33 years on the council by then (next year's elections), I have just celebrated my 60th birthday and I feel it is time for the younger generation to come forward.
"Edinburgh is the best city in the world - and I hope I have done my part to make it a better place."
