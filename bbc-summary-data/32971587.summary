The scheme, at 103 Colmore Row, would see the demolition of the NatWest Tower and its replacement by a Â£60m 26-storey skyscraper.
The developers said they had submitted the plans to the city council.
The council said it could not comment as it did not wish to prejudice the planning process.
Birmingham City Council planners previously deferred the demolition of the John Madin-designed NatWest Tower until the developers, Sterling Property Ventures and Rockspring, submitted plans for a replacement building.
The 1970s 22-storey building has been empty since 2003.
If approved the scheme would be the tallest office building under construction, although taller buildings have been developed in London and Manchester.
The proposed development will comprise of 19 floors of office space, with basement parking for 34 cars and 92 bicycles.
There will also be a winter garden and cafÃ© at street level and a retail unit.
At the top of the building, there are plans for a restaurant offering 360 degree views across the city.
James Howarth, managing director of Sterling Property Ventures, said: "103 will not just be another elitist commercial building.
"We are keen it becomes a destination for the people of Birmingham. The winter garden and skyline restaurant mean it will be accessible to all."
Eric Linden, European director at Rockspring, said: "It's our first investment in Birmingham and we are really proud of it.
"It is an elegant, modern building, symbolic of the city's ongoing regeneration."
If planning permission is granted, the proposed completion date is 2018.
