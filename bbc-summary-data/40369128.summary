The service, described as a celebration for her life, took place exactly a month after the terror attack.
Her brother Sam, who described Nell as "kind, caring, loving, confident and clever", said she would have wanted people to "love not hate" following her death.
He said: "Her kindness is something that this world will be a much worse place without. In fact, all things will be worse without Nell.
"But if everyone here tells someone about her spirit, her determination, her love, her kindness, then she will never be too far away."
Exactly a month ago, Nell Jones was an excited teenager looking forward to an evening with her best friend, singing and dancing to the music of Ariana Grande.
Today, as the bells of St Michael's and All Angels Church in Middlewich chimed 12 o'clock, hundreds of Nell's family and friends watched her coffin, draped in flowers, carried by her brothers into her funeral.
The men wore matching pink ties, adding to the array of floral tributes in a rainbow of colours, a contrast to the grey skies overhead.
Mourners sheltered from heavy rain under umbrellas lining the churchyard to hear the celebration of Nell's life echo out from loudspeakers.
Hymns included "One More Step Along The World I Go" which features the words "give me courage when the world is rough".
Nell's bother Sam spoke from the pulpit to express his anger at how "it shouldn't be this way. Nell should be talking about me at my funeral many years in the future."
During the service a message was read from Nell's friend Freya Lewis, who also attended the concert and remains in hospital after suffering fractures, lacerations and burns from shrapnel in the explosion.
Freya's sister Georgia, who read the message, said her sister credited her friend with passing on her "strength and bravery" to her.
She said: " I was so lucky to share Nell's last night, she was the happiest I have ever seen her."
Head teacher Dennis Oliver told mourners staff and students at Holmes Chapel High School had come together to support each other since the tragedy.
Nell's coffin, which was decorated with pink flowers, was carried into the church to Ed Sheeran song Photograph.
As the coffin left the church, the song Do I Love You (Indeed I Do) by Frank Wilson was played in memory of the teenager's love of Northern Soul.
