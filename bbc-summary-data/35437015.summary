Reid and Japan's Shingo Kunieda beat Gerard and Argentina's Gustavo Fernandez 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 in the semis.
They will now meet French top seeds Stephane Houdet and Nicolas Peifer in Saturday's final.
Reid, who ended partner Kunieda's nine-year unbeaten run in the singles competition with a 6-3 7-6 (7-1) victory in the quarter-finals, is second on court six against Gerard with his doubles final following at the end of the day.
