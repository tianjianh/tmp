Aerial footage of the Highlands recorded on a camera fitted to the tail rotor of a helicopter has been released by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.
The video was taken while Inverness Coastguard's search and rescue crew were on a training exercise.
The new tail rotor camera has captured the helicopter flying over mountains and lochs near Inverness.
