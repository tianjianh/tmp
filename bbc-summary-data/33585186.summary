The Reds' club doctor will now travel to the UK from the team's tour of Australia to complete Benteke's medical in the next 48 hours.
However, the 24-year-old Belgium international will not join up with his new team-mates on the tour.
Benteke joined Villa from Genk in 2012 for £7m, scoring 49 goals in 101 games.
Liverpool made a move for the striker after receiving funds from the £49m sale of Raheem Sterling to Premier League rivals Manchester City.
Benteke, who still has two years left on his Villa contract, scored 12 goals in 12 games last season to help Tim Sherwood's side avoid relegation from the top flight.
