Brentford 2-2 Bristol City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bobby Reid scored in the eighth minute of added time as Bristol City snatched a late draw against Brentford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Reid pounced on a rebound from Bees goalkeeper Daniel Bentley to cancel out the hosts' second-half comeback.
Josh Brownhill opened the scoring for City when he fired into the bottom corner from Famara Diedhiou's cut-back.
Frank Fielding made a series of fine saves before Ollie Watkins' back-post header and Neal Maupay's curling shot made it 2-1, only for Reid to equalise.
Brentford dominated possession and had 24 shots to Bristol City's eight, but came up against an inspired Fielding.
The experienced goalkeeper kept out Jota on several occasions, made a reflex stop from Romaine Sawyers and denied Henrik Dalsgaard, who then hit the post with a rebound.
His brilliance was rewarded when deep into added time - due to an injury to Josh McEachran - Reid pounced to pass his goal-tally for the entire 2016-17 season just three games into the new campaign.
Brentford manager Dean Smith: "We are definitely running cold in the luck department at the moment. Bristol City are a good team but we looked a class above them. If we play like that we are a top-six team
"I'm disappointed that the points tally is not as high as it should be after three games. We are not getting what we deserve right now but if we keep playing like that we will.
"We need some luck but otherwise our performance was outstanding.
"Their two goals both came from ricochets that could have gone anywhere but dropped perfectly for them and their keeper has had an inspired game, but all that will even itself out."
Bristol City boss Lee Johnson: "We may have lost that game last year but we dug in and picked up a point that I genuinely thought we were worth.
"We had three good chances near the end and should have had a penalty, and a lot of that was down to the spirit of the players and the supporters.
"Brentford are a good side but I knew we'd get chances on the break. I just didn't think we'd have to defend as much as we did.
"Brentford probably should have won their last two games but sometimes you have to dig in in the Championship and that could be as big a point as we have won in a long time because of the spirit we showed."
