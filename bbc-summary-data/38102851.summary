The National Lottery draw will no longer be shown live on BBC One from next year as part of a new deal between the broadcaster and operator Camelot.

Viewers wishing to see the balls drawn live on Saturdays will have to visit the iPlayer from 7 January onwards.
The Saturday draw has been a BBC One fixture since 1994. Its Wednesday counterpart was dropped in 2012.
The BBC said the decision to move the show onto a digital platform reflected changes in viewers' behaviour.
Charlotte Moore, director of BBC content, said the new three-year deal would give audiences "more ways to access the draw results across a range of platforms".
The National Lottery Awards, which recognises recipients of National Lottery Good Causes funding, will continue to be shown on BBC One.
