Up to six signed items and two VIP experiences are for sale, with proceeds going to stillborn support charity 4Louis.
Harry Arter's fianceÃ© Rachel gave birth to their stillborn daughter RenÃ©e in December.
The couple say the charity "really helped ease the pain".
A match-worn Fulham shirt signed by Scott Parker and signed training boots from Bournemouth club legend Steve Fletcher will feature in the eBay event.
4Louis provides support for bereaved parents who suffer a stillbirth or neonatal death by providing UK hospitals with equipment, such as memory boxes and cuddle cots.
Arter said: "We look at the memory box they provided every day - it's in our front room at home.
"The charity is run just by donations and help so many people that are in despair and going through what we went through, so we wanted to give back as much as we could."
The auction is due to end at 17:00 BST on Monday 18 April.
