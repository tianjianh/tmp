Domestic abuse: Police nearly 'overwhelmed' by increase

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police in England and Wales are on the verge of being "overwhelmed" by "staggering" increases in reports of domestic abuse, inspectors say.

Recorded cases rose 31% between 2013 and 2015, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) said.
It said this had led to "excessive" workloads and affected the quality and speed of investigations in some forces.
Meanwhile, a separate HMIC report found 31 out of 43 forces must improve their protection of vulnerable people.
HM Inspector of Constabulary Zoe Billingham issued the warning that police were close to being overwhelmed by the "staggering" increase in domestic abuse cases.
Her report is a follow-up to one published by HMIC in March 2014, which highlighted "significant weaknesses" in the service police gave domestic abuse victims.
The new report notes improvements since then, including a 31% increase in "domestic abuse related crimes" recorded by police - from 269,700 in the year to August 2013, to 353,100 in the year to March 2015.
Explaining why this is an improvement, the report says the rise could be partly due to better recording by police and forces "actively encouraging" victims to come forward.
There has also been a "determined effort" by police to make domestic abuse a priority, the report adds.
But it highlights problems including:
The report notes the "enormous" number of people affected by domestic abuse - with 900,000 calls to police in England and Wales in the 12 months to March 2015.
Violent, physical, sexual, psychological or emotional abuse - including threats and intimidation - in your home or elsewhere by your current or former partner, or any other adult family member.
It can also include financial abuse, such as a partner controlling your use of money or running up debts in your name.
Men and women can both be perpetrators and victims of domestic abuse, and victims are encouraged to call the police.

In its separate report on protection of vulnerable people, HMIC graded all 43 forces in England and Wales, rating 12 "good", 27 "requires improvement" and four "inadequate". No force was rated "outstanding".
The four forces rated "inadequate" were Bedfordshire, Essex, Staffordshire, Surrey.
Forces use different definitions of "vulnerable", but criteria can include age, disability and being a victim of repeated offences.
Ms Billingham said: "We witnessed a clear commitment from forces to improve the service they provide to vulnerable people generally. This determination now needs to translate into effective and consistent support and protection."
Mark Castle, chief executive of charity Victim Support, said: "This report makes disturbing reading, highlighting widespread failure by the police to identify, assess or support the most vulnerable victims of crime, in particular children."
