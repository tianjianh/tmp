King's business manager said a separate private family funeral would also be held in Las Vegas.
The guitarist and singer, known as the "King of the Blues", died in his sleep at his Vegas home on Thursday, aged 89.
He was known for hits My Lucille, Sweet Little Angel and Rock Me Baby.
Plans are also being made for funeral services in his hometown of Indianola, Mississippi next week.
He will be buried on the grounds of the BB King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center, which opened in 2008 and celebrates the cultural heritage of the Mississippi Delta where the blues was born.
In Las Vegas, fans will be able to pass King's open casket to pay their respects at the public viewing at Palm Mortuary West on Friday, according to a post on the late musician's website.
A private service will be held for family members on Saturday at a larger Palm Mortuary chapel, but the media will be excluded.
King had been admitted to hospital several times in recent weeks. His doctor and coroner said he died of a series of small strokes connected to his Type 2 diabetes.
King was born on 16 September 1925 to sharecroppers and worked in the cotton fields as a child before picking up the guitar.
He was considered one of the world's greatest players, known for his sharp single notes and vibrato on the electric guitar he christened Lucille.
He was married twice and had 15 natural and adopted children.
Daughters Shirley King, Rita Washington, Patty King and Karen Williams all complained that King's business manager of 39 years, LaVerne Toney, prevented them from visiting their father in his final days.
Toney has power-of-attorney over King's affairs.
Musicians paid their respects to King during a special tribute at the Billboard Music Awards in Las Vegas on Sunday night. Awards host Ludacris spoke, while the camera panned to King's beloved guitar Lucille, alone on the stage.
Rolling Stones star Mick Jagger reminisced about playing with King at The White House during the a Twitter Q&A with fans on Monday.
Keith Richards added: "Sad loss. One of the greats, I mean, beautiful style and BB was a great guy.
"He was one of the true gentlemen and I shall miss him a lot. What can you say now, at least we have his records and farewell BB."
