[SN]TITLE[SN]

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A painting of a rock daubed with the word Elvis on a Ceredigion hillside has been sent to the home of the king of rock 'n' roll in Memphis, Tennessee.

The rock has become a feature of Eisteddfa Gurig and artist Wynne Melville Jones captured it in a landscape painting.
Now, what began life has a misspelt act of graffiti in support of a politician will become a fixture at Graceland.
Mr Jones has sent it to be included in the museum.
Two men, the late film director John Hefin and David Meredith, former head of press and PR at HTV and S4C, painted the word Ellis on the rock in 1962 to show support for Islwyn Ffowc Elis, a novelist and Plaid Cymru candidate in Montgomeryshire.
However, they misspelt his surname by adding a second l, which was subsequently changed to a v and it has been known as Elvis rock ever since.
A limited edition print of this original painting has been presented to the Elvis Presley Archive at the famous mansion.
Mr Jones said: "Graceland is the most appropriate home for this painting - it has the Elvis museum and receives tens of thousands of visitors every year.
"I think this rock is like a national tribute from Wales to Elvis - the world's greatest rock star."
Mr Meredith said he was thrilled a print of the painting had been sent to Graceland and his original piece of graffiti had found such long-standing fame after being modified.
The original painting is part of an exhibition of Mr Jones's work in Oriel Rhiannon in Tregaron until 2 July.
