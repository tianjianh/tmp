Paedophile's partner jailed for recording court testimony

The girlfriend of a rapist who recorded the testimony of one of his victims on her phone has been jailed for three months.

Mother-of-two Patrice Brown, 28, had said her phone automatically started recording while one of Dwayne Kesto's victims gave evidence at Wolverhampton Crown Court.
Kesto was jailed for 16 years in July for raping two girls.
She was found guilty of contempt in December last year.
The court heard suspicions had been raised that Brown, an Aston University student, was secretly recording a victim's evidence during Kesto's trial, and she was arrested on 14 July last year.
She said her phone had malfunctioned after she had dropped it in the toilet, leading it to record without her knowledge.
However, Judge James Burbidge QC told the defendant she had made the 12 minute recording "deliberately".
While no evidence of her sharing the recording has been found, the court heard Brown had been in touch with Kesto's mother in Jamaica to keep her abreast of proceedings.
Brown, of Parkfield Avenue in Birmingham, claimed a custodial sentence would be "ridiculous", citing a lack of childcare arrangements, but Judge Burbidge said the seriousness of the case meant "a message needed to go out to the public".
He said: "If people come to court prepared to give evidence, whether vulnerable or not, and believe what they say is being recorded by a member of the perpetrator's family - and might be used elsewhere - that would undermine the system of justice."
