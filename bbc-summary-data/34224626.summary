The Jackson 5 are at number one in the UK singles chart, after their 1970 hit single ABC was sampled by a British DJ.

Sigala's song Easy Love welds Michael Jackson's vocals to a summery house beat. It has beaten the original song's chart peak of number eight.
The track even has the seal of approval from Tito Jackson, who said he "loved the track", according to Sigala.
Meanwhile, in the album chart, Iron Maiden scored their fifth number one with The Book Of Souls.
The band's 16th studio album had combined sales of more than 60,000 copies - almost double that of its nearest rival, I Cry When I Laugh, by Jess Glynne.
However, Glynne could console herself with two new entries in the singles chart.
Her current release, Don't Be So Hard On Yourself, rose two places to number three, while former number one Hold My Hand re-entered the countdown at 37.
The Londoner performed both songs on Strictly Come Dancing's launch show last week.
Justin Bieber's What Do You Mean was dethroned from the number one slot after just one week. But the song still managed to break the UK's all-time streaming record, clocking up 3.87 million plays over the last seven days.
There were 10 new entries in the album chart, as the music industry gears up for the busy Christmas period.
The newcomers had a distinctly 1980s flavour - with Iron Maiden joined by A-Ha, Public Image Limited and Duran Duran, whose hit album Rio reappears at 28.
The band's latest album, Paper Gods, was released on Friday.
Other new entries came from pop newcomer Troye Sivan at five and rock group Five Finger Death Punch at six.
Sam Smith's record In The Lonely Hour spent its 68th week in the top 10, climbing one place to number four after the singer revealed he would sing the new James Bond theme.
