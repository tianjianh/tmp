[SN]TITLE[SN]
Liverpool and Sevilla charged by Uefa for Europa League crowd trouble

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Liverpool and Sevilla have been charged by Uefa for "crowd disturbances" at the Europa League final.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Rival supporters clashed before kick-off at St Jakob-Park in Basel, after some Liverpool fans obtained tickets in the non-segregated Sevilla end.
The Spanish club, who won 3-1, sold only 7,000 of their 9,000 allocated tickets, with Reds fans appearing to fill three quarters of the stadium.
Liverpool also face a charge for "setting off of fireworks".
Sevilla, who play Barcelona in Sunday's Copa del Rey final, also received a charge for "throwing of objects".
This case will be dealt with on 21 July.
