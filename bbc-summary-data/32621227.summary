Artists including Stevie McCrorie, James Bay, Jamie Cullum and Twin Atlantic will also take part, with all BBC Radio Scotland music shows involved.
Sharon Mair, project executive of BBC Music at the Quay, said: "We know that our audiences loved the BBC at the Quay site last year during the Commonwealth Games and we are bringing this five day festival back to celebrate BBC Music Day.
"Glasgow is the UNESCO city of Music and what a brilliant way for us to showcase the city and the fantastic musical talent that will be at the event."
