[SN]TITLE[SN]
Mansfield Town 2-0 Forest Green Rovers

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals in six second-half minutes finally saw Mansfield take control as Forest Green lost their first Football League away match.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
After being frustrated by Rovers' spoiling tactics in the first half, the Stags grabbed the lead six minutes into the second as Danny Rose headed home a Joel Byrom corner at the far post.
The home side doubled their lead on 57 minutes as Paul Anderson, chasing a long forward ball, beat the offside trap to stride through on the left and, although Bradley Collins stopped his first effort, he tucked away the rebound into the empty net.
Rovers keeper Bradley Collins came up with two massive saves to make sure his side went in all square at the break.
After just five minutes he stood up tall to get in the way of Lee Angol's finish after he had robbed Lee Collins to run clear.
Then on the half-hour mark he got a good right hand to a powerful Paul Digby header from Byrom's corner.
Home keeper Conrad Logan had only one save to make all game in stoppage time.
