HMP Ranby report: Legal highs 'could overwhelm prison'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A prison's problems with new psychoactive substances (NPS) have led to high levels of violence, according to a report.

The HM Inspectorate of Prisons report said the availability of "legal highs" could also overwhelm health services at HMP Ranby, in Nottinghamshire.
The National Offender Management Service said it was working with police to disrupt the supply chain of NPS.
The report also highlighted six suicides in the space of 17 months.
NPS are chemically designed to mimic drugs that are already banned.
Martin Lomas, deputy chief inspector of prisons, said the jail, which holds 1,000 men, faces the challenge of "destabilising the supply of NPS which threatens to overwhelm it".
Inspectors were concerned that:
Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said since the inspection in September the number of inmates had been reduced by 120 and the number of staff had increased.
However, he said: "NPS remains a real concern in prisons and we are introducing a new testing regime which will be rolled out across the country from April.
"Legislation is in place to ban so-called 'legal highs' and we will continue to work with police to disrupt supply chains and take robust action against anyone found supplying or using NPS in prisons."
Inspectors said there were signs of improvement in some areas and were pleased to find fewer prisoners had said they felt unsafe or victimised.
This was still significantly higher than prisons of a similar size, however.
The inspections were carried out on 24-25 August, 1-4 and 7-11 September 2015.
