Zaneta Krokova, 11, and Helina Kotlarova, 12, who were "holding hands" as they crossed the road, died after the crash on Ashton Road.
Four men, aged 59, 48, 38 and 18, remain in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.
A fifth man, aged 23, has been de-arrested, police said.
Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said he was initially arrested for the same offence but was now assisting police with enquiries.
Greater Manchester Police said it had identified the car involved in the collision as a Blue Peugeot 807.
The dark blue vehicle, which had evidence of previous damage to its rear window, was found abandoned on Honeywell Lane.
Nigel Whittle, principal of Oasis Academy, Oldham, said the school was "deeply saddened" by the news of the deaths of Zaneta, who was a first year student, and her cousin Helina Kotlarova, a former pupil.
He said: "Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends at this extremely distressing and difficult time.
"We are a very closely-knit school community.  As our students return following the Christmas break, I know that they will care for one another, and our staff will be available to offer the support and time necessary as we all come to terms with this awful loss."
He said with the agreement of the Krokova family the school would join together to pay tribute to Zaneta in the coming weeks. A book of condolence would be opened on Thursday, he said.
