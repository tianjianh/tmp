Australian-born Crook joined Northants on loan from Lancashire in 2005, before signing on a permanent basis in 2006.
The 32-year-old has scored 3,067 first-class runs, including a best of 142 not out against Australia in a tour game in August, and taken 181 wickets.
"It is such a great club and I really enjoy working with all of the staff and the lads," he told the club website.
"I am really hoping that next season we can build on the success of this year and bring home some more silverware."
Northants finished fifth in Division Two of the County Championship in 2015 and were beaten by Lancashire Lightning in the T20 Blast final.
