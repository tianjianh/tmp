[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bonfire Night attacks on fire crews have been condemned and described as "nothing but a criminal act" by the Fire Brigades Union.

Firefighters and vehicles were targeted in incidents in south Wales, Salford, West Yorkshire and Essex, marring the 5 November celebrations.
Crews in Scotland also had missiles and fireworks thrown at them.
Dave Green, from the FBU, said the attacks were unacceptable and had a "debilitating" effect on staff morale.
In Oldham a teenage girl was seriously hurt after being hit by a firework.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) crews had were attacked as they attended numerous call-outs.
One firefighter was hit by a stone in Bingham, Edinburgh, as his crew helped tackle a rubbish fire.
In south Wales two fire crews were attacked by youths as they dealt with separate incidents, following an incident of a crew being attacked with fireworks in Cardiff on Tuesday.
"We condemn entirely people attacking firefighters in the course of duty," Mr Green said.
"This just goes beyond the pale and I think 99.9% of people would agree with us. It is just not acceptable and we ask people to consider that these firefighters are doing a job and the last thing they expect is the very people they're trying to help attacking them."
Elsewhere, youths threw fireworks at firefighters in Salford, and cars were set alight, while a fire engine had its window smashed in West Yorkshire and fireworks were fired at police officers in Basildon, Essex.
"Aside from the physical issue and the fear for their safety, the effect on morale is quite debilitating," added Mr Green.
"You're trying to help these people and they are turning on you. We are a humanitarian service."
Mr Green said substantial cuts to personnel, with 10,000 fewer firefighters than in 2010, had reduced the ability to build relationships within communities, a tactic which had helped break down the image of an "authority" service.
"This is something we experienced 15-20 years ago when it happened a fair amount," he said. "We thought we had nipped it in the bud.
"Attacks from 2000 to 2010 went down by 50% but since then, anecdotally, they appear to be back on the increase.
"It cannot be a coincidence and it reflects the amount of work we do in the community."
