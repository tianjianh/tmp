What we've learned about Leave campaign's view of life outside EU

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For weeks politicians who want to persuade you to leave the EU have been under fire from the other side for not being clear on their vision of the economy. Today one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign sketched in some, but not all, of the answers.

So, what do we know now that we didn't know when we got up this morning?
There is a bit more clarity about the campaign's broad approach. This is what they claim.
That is quite a list of claims. Remainers say they have to be taken not with a pinch, but several tonnes of salt. That it's impossible to imagine that we could keep the kinds of trade advantages we currently have and ditch some of the drawbacks.
Outers' central answer to the accusation that they're living in a fantasy is that other countries would be daft not to want to work with the UK anymore.
You've probably heard it by now - German car manufacturers would still want to sell us BMWs, French champagne houses would still want to flog their plonk - perish the thought they'd flounce off! But the only guarantee, such as it is, that the Out campaign will give that it's all feasible, is that they have had private assurances from ambassadors from other countries that such a deal can be done.
So today we've learnt a little, not a lot, about how the world might look if we leave the EU. But it could hardly be more different to yesterday's controversial Treasury tome.
What might grab more attention is Michael Gove's flamboyant suggestion that if we leave the EU, British voters could trigger a wave of democratic liberation across the continent.
Does this mean they hope Brexit could collapse the whole EU? 'Certainly' - came the answer from senior members of the team, an ambition more bold than anything Outers have come up with so far.
