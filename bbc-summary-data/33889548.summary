Among items on show in the 83-bedroom Shankly Hotel are his first contract at Liverpool FC and a gift from astronaut Neil Armstrong.
The hotel was unveiled earlier by ex-Reds John Aldridge and Ian Callaghan.
Seventy pieces from Shankly's family's collection are on view in the former Liverpool City Council building.
The hotel features items from Shankly's time as Liverpool manager and also from his playing days with Carlisle United and Preston North End.
Exhibits include the key to the Shankly Gates, which were unveiled at Liverpool's Anfield stadium in 1982, and Nasa badges given to him by Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong when they visited the club in the 1970s.
Christopher Shankly-Carline, Shankly's grandson and hotel director, said the family was proud of the venture.
He added: "It really is a special moment for us."
Shankly became Liverpool manager in 1959 and is credited with taking the club from English football's second tier to being a major force in Europe.
Under him, Liverpool won the First Division title in 1964, 1966 and 1973, the FA Cup in 1965 for the first time in the club's history and the Uefa Cup in 1973.
He retired in 1974 after winning the FA Cup for a second time.
