[SN]TITLE[SN]
North Ferriby United 0-2 Macclesfield Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
North Ferriby were left frustrated as Macclesfield returned from Grange Lane with a comfortable 2-0 National League win.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The home side rode their luck early on as, during a manic goalmouth scramble, Mitch Hancox hit the Ferriby bar.
After 17 minutes, however, defender George Pilkington came up from the back to head the Silkmen in front from a set-piece.
Within a few minutes Chris Holroyd flicked on for Danny Whitehead to fire past Rory Watson and put the visitors firmly in control.
In the second half, Holroyd also struck the post as John Askey's men continued to threaten, but contented themselves with the two-goal cushion.
