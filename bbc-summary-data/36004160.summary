Omar Bogle's spot-kick gave the visitors the lead after Evan Horwood was fouled by Ricky Miller in the box.
Dover came back strong in the second half as Jack Parkinson headed the hosts level from Nicky Deverdics' cross.
A point each means the Whites and Mariners, who are fourth and fifth in the table, are still waiting to guarantee their play-off places.
Grimsby Town manager Paul Hurst told BBC Radio Humberside:

"Coming here and looking at their home record, it's a hard-fought point. I think when you're playing against that type of team it's never going to be the greatest of spectacles. But I thought we had done well.
"First-half we had a few good situations which we couldn't quite capitalise on and probably the big point for us was when we hit the post and we should have scored.
"We concede from a set-piece, which is always going to be a threat for them which we spoke about and we dealt with quite a few of them, but this one seemed to just trickle into the net."
