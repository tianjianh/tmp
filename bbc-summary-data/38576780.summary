The Exiles have also signed defender Mickey Demetriou on a free transfer.
"This is an important loan move for Flo and we're delighted that we've managed to arrange this spell at for him," Huddersfield's head of operations Stuart Webber said.
Newport have seen six players depart since 1 January, and have now signed eight, with more arrivals expected.
Defender Demetriou was previously with Shrewsbury but was released at the end of last season after suffering a knee injury.
The Exiles are five points adrift at the bottom of League Two and have lost eight successive matches.
