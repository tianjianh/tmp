At least 10 people have been killed after a bus carrying prisoners lost control on an icy motorway and collided with a train in Texas, officials say.

Sheriff Mark Donaldson said the bus skidded off an overpass and slid down an embankment before hitting the train.
Texas officials said the bus was carrying 12 prisoners and three corrections officers from one prison in Abilene to another in El Paso.
A local hospital said they were treating five patients.
But their conditions were unclear.
A Union Pacific spokesman said there were no injuries on the train, but the railcars have not moved since the crash.
In a statement, the Texas criminal justice department said eight prisoners and two corrections officers were killed.
"It's with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of those killed and injured this morning in a tragic accident," executive director Brad Livingston said.
"Their loved ones will be in our thoughts and prayers."
