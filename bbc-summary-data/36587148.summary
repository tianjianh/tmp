Darren Adie, 42, was found unconscious on a Kirkcaldy street on Saturday 28 May and later died in hospital.
His father, John Adie, 67, said: "We're devastated. Imagine what his kids will feel like growing up knowing their father was murdered and left lying in the street."
Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to Â£10,000 for information.
Mr Adie was found unconscious on Tweed Avenue near the junction of Lawson Street at about 18:.45 on 28 May.
Speaking about the person who murdered their son, Mr Adie said: "I'd say to them to do the right thing.
"Anyone who knows them, do the right thing and get in touch with the police.
"We want to bury our son and we can't do that until his killer has been arrested."
Mr Adie said Darren's two brothers and sister had been left "devastated" by his death and that it had "ruined their life".
Det Ch Insp Raymond Brown said there had been 100 sightings of Darren Adie on 28 May.
He said: "That Saturday was the night of the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.
"At 6pm that night he was in the Overton Mains area and was shouting on a person named Kelly - this may be a male or female and we need them to come forward.
"He went down to Overton Road and was in Valente's chip shop before moving through the housing estate there.
"He was speaking to a white male in his 40s with a bald head, wearing a blue T-shirt and grey joggers."
Det Ch Insp Brown said Mr Adie then moved away towards Tweed Avenue, walking past two separate couples.
He said the man was aged 20-30, of chubby build, who had short, brown hair and was wearing a white vest and grey jogging bottoms and walked with a limp.
The woman was of slim build with brown, shoulder-length hair with a red tint through it.
The second couple was a man and woman in their 20s who were pushing a double buggy in Tweed Avenue.
The officer said another man police wanted to trace may have given Mr Adie some help. He was wearing a grey hoodie and jogging bottoms.
