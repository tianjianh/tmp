Teenager Isobel Narayan bought suicide drugs online

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A coroner has expressed concern that a teenager was able to buy drugs online to help kill herself.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
College student Isobel Narayan, 16, was found dead at her family home in Didsbury, Manchester, in December 2011 after taking the drugs.
They had been delivered to her house in two packages in the post, Manchester Coroner's Court heard.
Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows said it was a "matter of public concern" she was able to get hold of the drug.
Mr Meadows said he would be writing to "the relevant authorities to try to minimise the risk of it happening again".
Miss Narayan had looked up forums giving guidance on assisted suicide for people with terminal illnesses in the months before her death, the court heard.
Her father, Harry Narayan, a barrister and crown court recorder in Manchester, told the inquest his youngest daughter was top of her year in physics and studying A-levels with the hope of studying to be a vet like her older sister, Freya.
A keen horse-rider, she was also on the student council at Xaverian College in Manchester but was "so able" her studies did not really challenge her and she craved more homework to do.
Her family said there was nothing to suggest she was unhappy, but a police investigation of her computer revealed she suffered "misplaced" and "unfathomable" feelings of low self-esteem and worthlessness, the inquest was told.
Mr Meadows said he had to record a verdict that Isobel killed herself.
The type of drug involved in Miss Narayan's death has not been disclosed.
