Plans for a panel of experts to advise on major transport, energy and environmental projects have been unveiled by the Welsh Government.

The National Infrastructure Commission was a Plaid Cymru pledge backed by Labour in a post-election deal.
Launching a consultation, Economy Secretary Ken Skates said Wales needed the "systems and services in place to enable it to work effectively".
Plaid Cymru said that without borrowing powers, it was a "missed opportunity".
Labour promised to set up the commission as part of an agreement struck with Plaid to back Carwyn Jones's return as first minister after the assembly election in May.
"It will provide us with independent, expert and strategic advice on our infrastructure decision making and importantly, will also help us to ensure the best long term value for Welsh public money," said Mr Skates.
The body would also liaise with the UK's National Infrastructure Commission, launched in 2015 by the then Chancellor George Osborne.
The commission would not be involved in schools, hospitals or housing as the Welsh Government said the relevant planning authorities already had "well-established, effective arrangements" in place.
Plaid Cymru said its plan - unveiled earlier in October - would give the commission borrowing powers to raise Â£7.5bn over 10 years.
Shadow Infrastructure Secretary Dai Lloyd said: "Creating an advisory body is one thing, but if Wales is to make significant gains in terms of its infrastructure then we need to think innovatively around how we fund future projects.
"The Welsh Government needs to be far more innovative if it is to realise Wales' economic potential."
Consultation on the Welsh Government proposal is open until January.
