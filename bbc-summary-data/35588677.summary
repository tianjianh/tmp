Bradley Long was due to appear at Dundee Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Mr Long is accused of extorting £81,306 from a man between May 2011 and June 2014 and attempting to extort a further £36,500.
He allegedly threatened the man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, with violence and damage to his property.
It is further claimed that Mr Long warned the man that he would "reveal private information to his family".
Mr Long is also accused of behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards the man on a date in March 2015, possession of cannabis and being concerned in the supply of cocaine between May 2011 and March 2015.
The 30-year-old, whose address was given on court documents as Priory Crescent, Arbroath, but who is understood to live in London, did not turn up for a pre-trial hearing to face the charges.
Billy Rennie, defending, said: "I haven't seen him since last year and haven't had any communication."
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC granted a warrant for his arrest.
