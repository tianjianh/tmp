The Scottish SPCA was called out after the ducklings were spotted in Ellon.
Animal rescue officer Hannah Gorrara said: "Some lovely children were able to show me the drain where the ducklings were swimming about.
"I think their mother must have lost them. It is very sad that they are no longer with their mum but they are doing well in our care."
She added: "Thankfully, it wasn't too big a drop.
"Hopefully we'll be able to release them back into the wild in about six weeks time once they are fully fit and able to fend for themselves."
They were taken to the animal charity's National Wildlife Rescue Centre at Fishcross.
