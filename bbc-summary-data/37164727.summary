The Belgian, 27, has moved to Villa Park on a three-year contract after the clubs agreed an undisclosed fee.
De Laet is the third ex-Premier League player to join Villa this month after West Brom defender James Chester and Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak.
Villa boss Roberto di Matteo has now made seven signings since being appointed in early June.
He has also brought in Bournemouth defender Tommy Elphick, goalkeeper Pierlugi Gollini, Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola and Fulham striker Ross McCormack.
De Laet, who spent the second half of last season helping Middlesbrough to win promotion from the Championship, made the last of his 129 Leicester appearances at Villa Park in January.
He scored against Villa for the Foxes when they came back from two down to win 3-2 at the King Power Stadium last September.
