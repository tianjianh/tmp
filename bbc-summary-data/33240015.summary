Accident and emergency waiting times at Scotland's newest hospital have improved since trouble-shooters arrived - but they are still below standard.

Ministers ordered specialists in after it emerged the Â£842m South Glasgow University Hospital was the worst-performing in Scotland.
Figures last week showed 78.3% of A&E patients were seen and treated within four hours, well below the 95% target.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) said the average was now 89.6%.
NHS GGC chief executive Robert Calderwood acknowledged that there was still work to do to meet the national target of 95%.
"There is still some way to go to achieving a sustained performance and improvement is still required to achieve the national target consistently but I am confident that we are moving in the right direction," he said.
The 1,109-bed hospital, which began taking patients in April, was built on the site of the Southern General and is one of the largest acute hospitals in the UK.
The new campus replaces the Royal Hospital for Sick Kids at Yorkhill, the Southern General Hospital, the Western and Victoria Infirmaries, and the Mansionhouse Unit.
Mr Calderwood again stressed that the process of transferring these services to the new hospital had been challenging but said progress was being made.
"There is no doubt that change on this scale - the biggest hospital migration ever undertaken in the UK - has been a significant challenge to our unscheduled care performance," he said.
"However, our teams have been responding quickly and effectively to these challenges and the tireless efforts of managers and clinicians are now bearing fruit in the form of an improving A&E performance."
