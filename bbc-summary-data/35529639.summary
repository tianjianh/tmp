Mexico: Crime reporter kidnapped in Veracruz

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The Mexican authorities in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz say they are searching for a reporter who was dragged from her home by armed men and hasn't been seen since.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Anabel Flores Salazar was taken by the men on Monday morning from her home near the city of Orizaba, where she worked for several newspapers.
At least 15 journalists have been killed in Veracruz since 2010.
Relations between the Veracruz governor and the media have been tense.
State Governor Javier Duarte has accused some journalists of having criminal ties.
He went on to warn them to "behave", arguing that if anything were to happen to them, he would be "crucified".
Some local journalists saw this as a thinly veiled threat against them.
In the case of Anabel Flores Salazar, prosecutors say they are investigating all her "possible ties".
The office said she had been seen in the company of a leader of the local branch of the Zetas drug cartel two years ago.
Veracruz is the most dangerous place to be a journalist in Mexico, which itself is deemed one of the most unsafe countries for journalists.
Nationwide, 88 journalists have been murdered since 2000, according to free speech organisation Article 19.
Fourteen journalists from Veracruz state alone have died since Governor Duarte took office in 2010.
