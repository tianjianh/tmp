Cardiff-Swansea rail disruption due to upgrade works

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Rail disruption has continued for a second day in south Wales due to restrictions because of re-signalling work at Cardiff Central.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amended timetables have been put in place and delays are expected due to limited platform space as a result of Network Rail's work.
On Thursday, passengers faced "severe" delays and cancellations after the upgrade work overran.
Replacement buses will operate in affected areas.
Affected services include:
National Rail said trains were expected to be delayed by up to 30 minutes, cancelled or revised until the end of service on Friday.
Passengers on affected journeys between Cardiff and Newport can use alternative train operators, it added.
People have been advised to check their journey before they travel at www.arrivatrains.wales/check for the latest information.
Network Rail's upgrade work in the Cardiff area will continue until 2 January.
