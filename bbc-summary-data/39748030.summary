Earle admitted six counts of indecent assault on the boy while working as deputy head teacher at Upcott House Preparatory School.
Speaking after the verdict his victim Mr Peters said "the burden of shame had been lifted" after coming forward.
He described to police how he was taken from his bed in a dormitory at the school into the private room of Earle and forced to engage in sexual activity.
The abuse continued on a regular basis throughout the victim's time at the school until he left in 1962, aged 14. The school closed shortly after.
Mr Peters thanked police and said counselling since he came forward as has enabled him to "live freely for the first time since I was nine years old".
He called child sex abuse "an urgent social problem".
"I would assure other victims who want to come forward that the police were brilliantly supportive and that professional help can be hugely liberating for survivors of child sex abuse," he added.
Sentencing Earle, Judge Erik Salomonsen said: "This was a gross breach of trust.
"You used a young child to satisfy your sexual needs on many occasions. It was your responsibility to educate and protect him."
