The former Germany midfielder, who was made to train on his own earlier this season, was a late substitute during Wednesday's EFL Cup win over West Ham - his first appearance of the season.
The 32-year-old has spoken to Major League Soccer side Chicago Fire and had contact with other clubs in the USA.
"Of course he can [stay]," said Mourinho on Friday.
"If you have a contract, you are the powerful one that can decide your future. In January he is the powerful one - and with better feelings than before.
"Everybody was happy because when he was not training he fought against that and managed to do it without injury.
"He had been working for months and I thought it could be a good opportunity for him to play and help us."
Mourinho, whose side are sixth in the Premier League table and play at Everton on Sunday (16:00 GMT), has been told money is available to make signings during the January transfer window.
The Portuguese wants to strengthen his defence, with Benfica's Sweden international Victor Lindelof heavily linked with a move to Old Trafford.
At the start of the season, Mourinho said he had "a lot" of players, having decided to use 23 players in his squad, plus three goalkeepers.
Schweinsteiger's return has increased the number of outfield players he has used this term to 24.
Mourinho said: "Nobody deserves to be pushed, for me to say 'it's better for you to leave'.
"I am comfortable having them all and it hurts me not to select them because of the way they work.
"But frustration is something that comes to players in certain moments of their careers and we will analyse it if anyone shows me they have a desire to leave."
Mourinho was banned from the dugout for Wednesday's game after being sent off during the Premier League match against West Ham for kicking a water bottle in anger.
It is the second time he has been dismissed this season, and his latest punishment also included a Â£16,000 fine.
He said: "I kick a bottle of water. I cannot do it. I accept the suspension of one match, it's as simple as that. But it has to be the same for every manager."
