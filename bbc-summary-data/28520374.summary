Four people, including two children, were rescued off the Gower coast after their dinghy got swept out to sea.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Two adults got into difficulty in the water after they went to help the boys when their inflatable boat got caught in a rip tide at Mewslade Bay on Sunday.
The Horton and Port Eynon lifeboat was launched and a boat from Gower Coast Adventures went to help.
The boys were pulled from the sea, while the adults swam to rocks onshore.
They sustained minor cuts but the children were uninjured.
Jeff Payne, of Horton and Port Eynon lifeboat station said: "I do not want to think of the possible consequences had a boat not been on hand to rescue the boys."
He warned people using inflatable boats to check local conditions, in particular rip tides and offshore winds, and advised adults to keep boats on a line when children are using them.
