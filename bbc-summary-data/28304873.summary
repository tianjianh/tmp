[SN]TITLE[SN]
Reshuffle: Who will be the winners?

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
On Monday the losers learnt their fate.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Now we will discover who are the winners in a reshuffle made more dramatic and more wide-ranging by the decision of William Hague to quit the post he has filled for four years.
If, as expected, he is replaced by Philip Hammond we will see the appointment not just of new foreign and defence secretaries but also new environment and Welsh secretaries - to replace Owen Paterson and David Jones who've both been sacked - as well as a new attorney general and chief whip to fill posts left by Dominic Grieve unwillingly and Sir George Young who stood down.
The departure of at least another half a dozen senior ministers one rung below cabinet level leaves room for wholesale changes.
This purge of middle aged white men may help make way for the women David Cameron has long promised to promote and for the return of the former Defence Secretary Liam Fox.
At the end of today the question will be not which names have come and gone but the political impact of the changes.
We may have a new foreign secretary who has said he'd be ready to contemplate leaving the EU if it doesn't change and an attorney general who, unlike his predecessor, would not oppose threatening to leave the European Convention on Human Rights.
