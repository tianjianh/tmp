Perth-based MGM Timber will open new branches in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and either East Kilbride or Cambuslang in South Lanarkshire.
About 35 posts will be created across the new sites.
The company, which employs 160 staff across 12 sites, said the move was in response to growing consumer demand.
Roles will include managers, sales representatives, administrators, supervisors, yard operatives and delivery drivers.
MGM, which is part of the James Donaldson Group of companies, has been trading for 25 years. Last year it reported turnover of Â£40m.
Commercial manager Michael Donaldson said: "The timber industry in Scotland has grown hugely over the last few years.
"The manufacturing of timber products and the supply chain have both improved.
"Additionally we are seeing a lot more investment in the construction industry overall. More new homes are being built and more home improvements are being carried out."
He added: "We've established strong sites across Scotland, and we want to build on that success with a wider network to help meet consumer demand.
"We also only have one site north of Dundee which is in Inverness so opening a branch in Aberdeen is a particular focus for us."
