Edinburgh city council to spend up to £2m on tram inquiry

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh taxpayers are now being asked to meet some legal costs of officials who were responsible for what went wrong with the capital's tram project.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Edinburgh city council is to spend up to £2m participating in the public inquiry into the capital's tram fiasco.
Some will be spent on legal costs of ex councillors and staff who were in charge when it was hit by delays.
The council has refused a request from inquiry chairman Lord Hardie to revive its arm's length transport firm Tie.
It said that would have increased its costs to £4m.
Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh City Council's transport convener, said: "I feel it is morally the right thing to do and yes, while, I may have criticised some of the individuals at the end of the day, they are entitled to have some independent legal costs to give them some legal advice and support because at the time they were employees or elected members of the city centre."
Andrew Burns, the council's leader, said: "The council continues to support the inquiry, as it has done so throughout, and to be fully open and accountable.
"By applying to be a core participant we have committed to playing our part in the proceedings and co-operating fully with the inquiry.
"However, we do not believe the considerable cost of reviving for the sake of the inquiry is a justifiable expense, one which would ultimately be borne by the Edinburgh taxpayer.
"The council is the ultimate parent body of Tie, and we have communicated our willingness to provide information about its role to the inquiry."
The trams began operating on 31 May last year after six years of disruption and cost increases.
Alex Salmond, who was first minister at the time, announced there would be an inquiry into the project in June 2014, and it has since been awarded statutory powers to compel witnesses to participate.
A preliminary hearing will be held on Wednesday.
A spokesman for the inquiry said there would be no comment on the council's decision ahead of the hearing.
