Daily Telegraph journalist Lyndsey Telford recorded staff after securing a job at the South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) centre in Bicester.
Rob Wilson MP is asking the Care Quality Commission to investigate if patients were put at risk.
The ambulance service said it has launched its own inquiry.
Ms Telford successfully applied for a job at the non-emergency 111 call centre and recorded conversations with staff during a one-month training course.
She was trained to use the service's Pathways computer system, which uses a series of questions to assess the seriousness of the patient's condition.
At one point her mentor said: "One way or another, everyone in this room has killed someone indirectly because of what we've done but we're covered because it's all recorded."
Reading East MP Mr Wilson said: "These are clearly very serious allegations that have been made and they must be investigated fully and fairly.
"I will be writing to the Care Quality Commission to ask them to investigate whether my constituents were placed at risk and, if so, why this was allowed to happen and how they will ensure that it never happens again."
In response to article the SCAS director of strategy James Underhay said an investigation had been launched.
"With regard to our NHS 111 services, we would like to reassure members of the public that [we] use a safe and nationally prescribed call-taking and clinical assessment system, NHS Pathways, which assists us in ensuring that patients in a life-threatening or serious condition are treated as a priority."
The call centre handles calls from Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire.
