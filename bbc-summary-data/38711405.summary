Fly-tippers who dumped an "obscene" quantity of waste including a toilet, bathtub and fridge on a road "could have caused a fatal accident", a cyclist has said.

Martin Galpin came across the debris on London Lane in Houghton Conquest, Bedfordshire, on Saturday afternoon.
"If it had been dark it could have been fatal as there are no lights," he said.
Central Bedfordshire Council has so far been unable to confirm if the waste is still blocking the road.
The debris covering the narrow lane also included door and window frames, bricks, paperwork and a duvet.
Police believe the same person fly-tipped in two other areas nearby.
"Someone's obviously renovating a house and they've left quite a lot of it here," Mr Galpin said.
He came across it at about 16:50 GMT on Saturday. A motorist had already stopped and called police who closed the road.
Bedfordshire Police said officers attended two other similar reports of fly-tipping "in the area" and believe they may be linked.
The debris was still blocking the road and had not been removed when Mr Galpin cycled the same route on Sunday at about 13:00.
"There are road closed signs, but drivers are ignoring that until they reach the rubbish, then they're having to turn back," he said.
