London, Liverpool and Birmingham have expressed interest in staging the event after host city Durban pulled out.
Manchester City Council said it was ready "to ensure the delivery of a successful games" if asked.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he would be "happy to work with" Manchester.
However, in a tweet he said Liverpool would "challenge" any attempt to "gift the games to London or anyone else without a proper bidding and procurement process".
It is understood Manchester would be willing to act as a host city, or in collaboration with other locations.
The city hosted the games in 2002.
In a statement, the council said: "If we were invited to help, we would be pleased to work with the Commonwealth Games Federation and the government to ensure the delivery of a successful 2022 Games in England."
A spokesman for the Mayor of London said the games are "a wonderful sporting event" and London "would listen to any proposal to host in 2022".
"However there would be a number of practical issues to consider with the government and other stakeholders, including the substantial amount of funding it would require."
