[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Bournemouth will hand a fitness test to Harry Arter, who picked up a calf problem in the victory over West Ham.

Andrew Surman returns from a one-match ban but Tyrone Mings is still suspended and Junior Stanislas remains a doubt with a groin injury.
Swansea top scorer Fernando Llorente has recovered from the dead leg he sustained against Hull last weekend.
However, Martin Olsson and Angel Rangel are out after suffering ankle and foot injuries respectively during that game.
Mark Scott: "Strikers were in the spotlight for these two sides last weekend.
"Joshua King shrugged off a missed penalty to continue his hot streak, while Swansea struggled when Fernando Llorente was forced off.
"So Eddie Howe's relief at Bournemouth ending their winless run would have been an emotion shared by Paul Clement upon learning his top scorer will be fit for this one.
"You'd argue the loss at Hull was Swansea's first real setback under Clement, as their only other league defeats came against Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea.
"He was disappointed with their defending at the KCOM Stadium and, given both clubs are far from watertight at the back, we should be in for goals (â€¦cue a 0-0 and last spot on MOTD!)"

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: "With so few games to go each game takes on more importance. On the back of last week's win we want to keep pushing forwards and continuing our form.
"We're confident and we believe in ourselves, the players showed last week their ability to score goals, which is crucial at any stage of the season."
Swansea City head coach Paul Clement: "It's more than likely that we will not be safe before the end of the season.
"We have done very well against teams through January and in to February.
"Clearly we're very disappointed after Hull, not necessarily that we lost the game but that we allowed a team below us to get closer to us."
Bournemouth are at home, where they always seem to create a lot of chances. They often leave themselves wide open at the back too, but I fancy them to win again on Saturday.
Prediction: 2-1
