The Swans have two games left this season - away at West Ham and home to Manchester City - having already secured Premier League survival.
Wales will prepare for Euro 2016 with a training camp in Portugal later in May.
"Hopefully it's a chance to rest a few of the senior players, especially with the Euros in mind," said Swansea assistant coach Alan Curtis.
"It's a chance for some of the younger players and some of the fringe players to come in.
"Two tough games, West Ham and Manchester City, so you don't want to just throw the youngsters in and expose them."
Swansea captain Williams is also Wales' skipper and played every minute of their successful Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.
Left-back Taylor played in nine of the 10 qualifiers, as he was rested for the final match against Andorra.
The 27-year-old has made 39 appearances for club and country this season, while Williams has played 43 games in all competitions for the two sides.
Wales' appearance at Euro 2016 will be their first in the finals stage of a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup.
