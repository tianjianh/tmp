Gemma Whyley, 28, was one of two coaches involved with the Welsh Paracheer Unified Freestyle Pom team that won gold at the ICU Cheerleading Championships in Orlando, Florida.
A quarter of the team has physical disabilities.
Ms Whyley said: "Winning Wales' ever first gold in cheerleading was a dream come true."
"The build-up from January this year was pretty intense but all the hard work paid off in the end.
"It's something we'll all remember for the rest of our lives."
