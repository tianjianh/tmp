[SN]TITLE[SN]
League One: Northampton Town 3-2 Milton Keynes Dons

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Unbeaten Northampton Town gained their first League One win since promotion by beating 3-2 MK Dons in a thriller.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harry Beautyman scored with a shot on the turn in the eighth minute for the Cobblers, who are now 30 games unbeaten in the league.
Alex Revell's glancing header made it 2-0, before Matt Taylor curled in a fine free-kick for a third.
Dean Bowditch pulled one back for MK Dons, and Taylor had a penalty saved before a late Samir Carruthers goal.
Northampton, who won League Two last season, were three goals up inside the first half-an-hour, leading when Jak McCourt won the ball and advanced into the area before finding Beautyman, who beat goalkeeper David Martin from 10 yards.
Former Dons striker Revell doubled the advantage five minutes later, getting on the end of Taylor's excellent cross to find the bottom corner of the net.
Nicky Maynard went close for the visitors with a shot on the turn which goalkeeper Adam Smith saved comfortably, but the hosts increased their lead in the 28th minute when Taylor curled a 20-yard free-kick over the wall and into the top corner of the net.
Ed Upson flashed a shot wide before the visitors reduced the arrears in the 38th minute when Bowditch headed home a cross from Carruthers.
Northampton squandered a great opportunity to restore their three-goal advantage shortly after the restart - Bowditch conceding a penalty when he impeded Kenji Gorre only for Martin to save Taylor's effort.
Smith kept out a fierce drive from Carruthers as the visitors looked to make the most of the let-off.
The home side had further chances on the counter but Carruthers reduced the deficit in stoppage-time, racing on to Darren Potter's pass to beat Smith.
