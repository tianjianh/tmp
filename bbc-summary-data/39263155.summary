[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Shots started brightly and thought they had taken the lead inside 10 minutes only for Scott Rendell's close-range effort to be ruled out for offside.
The home side's constant pressure finally reaped dividends in the 17th minute as Shamir Fenelon got in front of a marker to convert Bernard Mensah's cross with a neat flick.
Aldershot doubled their lead seven minutes before half-time after Nick Arnold swung in a deep cross for Mensah to sweep home from three yards.
The Daggers pulled one back in the second half as Aldershot failed to clear a deep 57th-minute corner and skipper Scott Doe looped a header inside the far post, but Matt McClure's 25-yarder into the bottom corner made the points safe seven minutes from time.
Daggers keeper Elliot Justham prevented a fourth with a brilliant save to keep out Arnold's free-kick.
