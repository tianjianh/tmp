Ceremonies to mark Arras centenary

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Events in Edinburgh and France are being held to mark the centenary of the Battle of Arras, in which 18,000 Scots died.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The fighting saw the highest concentration of Scots involved in any World War One campaign.
Of the 120 battalions that took part at Arras, 44 of them were Scottish.
Descendants of troops will join schoolchildren from across Scotland for the commemorations at Arras and Edinburgh Castle.
Arras was fought from 9 April to 16 May 1917 and marked the beginning of the spring offensive on the Western Front.
The Allies suffered 159,000 casualties, including 46,000 Scots, during the offensive.
The moderator of the Church of Scotland will conduct a service at Faubourg d'Amiens Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Arras while the Royal Regiment of Scotland band will conduct a Beating Retreat in the Place des Heros.
In Edinburgh, a service will take place in the Scottish National War Memorial, followed by a Beating Retreat by the HM Royal Marines Scotland band on Edinburgh Castle Esplanade.
Among those attending the event in Arras will be the moderator's wife, Margaret Barr.
She plans to lay flowers on the grave of her great uncle, David Wyllie, who lost his life in battle at the age of 29.
Born in 1888 and the eldest son of Robert and Jane Wyllie from North Berwick, David was fatally injured by gunshots during the six-week offensive.
He joined up, despite being exempt because of his occupation as a farmhand.
He later sent postcards home of quaint French villages with their names blacked out so they could not be used by the enemy to target troops.
The only hint of the terrible conditions he experienced was a line in a letter that said he had just been in "bad weather and bad trenches, so we had anything but a pleasant time of it."
And replying to a letter saying the family now had two cars, he said: "I would not mind if I was at home again having a run around in them." He was killed not long after sending that letter.
Mrs Barr still has the telegram that was sent to David Wyllie's father informing him of his son's death.
Speaking ahead of the ceremony in France, she said: "It's a huge privilege to go out to Arras and represent the family, and to lay a wreath. It will be quite poignant. I will go and see his grave at Duisans Cemetery and lay flowers there.
"I think my father would be very proud and happy that one of his family will be there at the ceremony.
"It will be a very emotional day."
Joining the commemorations in Edinburgh will be Margery Mackay, whose Uncle Donald also fought in the battle and died on 28 April 1917 after being caught in an ambush.
He had joined up in September 1914 and went 31 months without leave before he found himself on the front line in Arras.
She said: "It was only after the loses in the Somme that the regiment was moved to Arras."
Mrs Mackay became interested in his story after finding and reading his last letter home.
She said: "He seemed to be just an average ordinary man of the day, who really felt that they had to go and fight. In his letter he talks about his family and really seemed to care for them."
She added: "I really don't think they knew what they were getting into and they ended up in such horrific conditions, but in his letter he talks about being in the army for 31 months, not having had any leave and that his conduct was good.
"He still sounded quite sane and he still sounded as if he was prepared to do his duty and I just feel this is almost like a last chance to remember him."
