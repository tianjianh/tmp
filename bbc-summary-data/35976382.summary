The 19-year-olds became cragfast - stuck while tackling a route - on 1,055m (3,461ft) Liathach on Tuesday afternoon.
Torridon and Kinlochewe Mountain Rescue Team helped them to a spot from where they could be safely airlifted off the peak by a coastguard helicopter.
The trio were not injured during their ordeal.
