This Easter I have been up to lots of things like going to church , baking , going to the park with my bike and lots more. On Easter Sunday , I am doing a Easter egg hunt at my Sunday school. For Lent I gave up chewing gum and bubble gum but not chocolate, I'm too obsessed with it.

I have given up chocolate for Lent and it's the hardest thing I've ever done! I'm really pumped for Easter Sunday when I can eat all the chocolate I like.
