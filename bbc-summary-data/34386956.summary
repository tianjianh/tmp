An Australian photographer has used a 19th Century technique to create captivating modern portraits featuring Brisbane cityscapes.

Robyn Stacey used camera obscura, the forerunner to the camera, to literally turn high rise rooms into a camera.
The inverted reflections of the outside view were then photographed inside the room by Ms Stacey as part of her stunning Cloud Land series.
She says her work draws inspiration from the transient nature of cities.
Ms Stacey said the city of Brisbane is rapidly changing, but not looking back.
"It is interesting as now that everything has gone 99.9% digital, people are getting interested in the analogue processes, so people are making late 19th Century forms of photography," she told ABC radio.
"Because light travels in a straight line, whatever is down on the ground you will see on the ceiling as it is a straight line," Ms Stacey said.
"The exposure time for the photos runs from one minute and four minutes, depending on the brightness outside."
