However Al Masry are still not allowed to host competitive matches.
On Wednesday several thousand Masry fans watched their team train for their upcoming Confederation Cup play-off.
That game against Uganda's KCCA will be played 85 km away in Ismailia where the Port Said-based team has been playing and training.
Wednesday's training started with a moment of silence for the fans who died and as doves of peace were also released.
