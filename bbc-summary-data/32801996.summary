Dublin: Police release image of baby Maria found in bag

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Police have released a photograph of a newborn baby girl found in a bag near a gateway at Rathcoole, County Dublin, on 8 May.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They are hoping to trace the child's mother who has not come forward.
The baby girl was found at Steelstown Lane on a Friday afternoon.
It is thought that she may have been born 24 to 36 hours earlier. She was wrapped in a beige fleece and placed with a towel into a black bag inside a green paper carrier bag.
Staff at the Dublin hospital where she was taken have called her Maria.
Sgt Maeve O'Sullivan of the Child Protection Unit in Clondalkin said: "We are releasing this photograph so mum can see her little baby girl and we would ask mum to please contact us."
Police said they were only concerned for the welfare of the baby's mother and that they were not treating the matter as a criminal investigation.
They have appealed for information.
