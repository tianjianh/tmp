[SN]TITLE[SN]
Alaves 1-4 Real Madrid

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick and missed a penalty as Real Madrid beat Alaves to increase their lead at the top of La Liga.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Deyverson gave Alaves an early lead but conceded a penalty which was converted by Portugal forward Ronaldo.
Ronaldo added a second before the break with a deflected shot but had a second spot-kick saved by Alaves goalkeeper Fernando Pacheco 10 minutes from time.
Alvaro Morata scored Real's third before Ronaldo completed his treble.
Zinedine Zidane's side are two points above Barcelona, who beat Granada 1-0 later on Saturday.
Real are three clear of city rivals Atletico Madrid - 4-2 winners over Malaga - and Sevilla, who dropped from second to fourth with a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon.
Alaves were unbeaten at home in La Liga before this match, but once again Ronaldo's impact on the game was decisive.
The 31-year-old confidently sent Pacheco the wrong away from the penalty spot to equalise after Brazilian forward Deyverson was deemed to have handled, then his long-range effort sailed into the top corner.
Pacheco dived low to his low to save Ronaldo's second penalty, but Real's record goalscorer completed his hat-trick after exchanging passes with Marcelo inside the area.
