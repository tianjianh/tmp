Fly-half Sam Davies says is undaunted by his rivalry with Wales Six Nations pivot Dan Biggar for the Ospreys fly-half spot.

The 22-year-old has impressed for his region this season, helping them to rise to sixth in the Pro12 after a poor start to the season.
"I wouldn't say it's a daunting prospect, I've got to play the best I can when I'm playing," said Davies.
"Who knows what might happen when he (Biggar) comes back."
Davies has played 20 games for Ospreys this season, eight more than Biggar, who was also with Wales at the 2015 World Cup.
"He's (Biggar) doing well with Wales and when he does go away it's about me doing as well as I can for the team," said Davies.
"Hopefully the form can keep going and that will push Dan and myself further.
"We get along well, we have kicking competitions, and that does drag us both along and we are pushing each other."
The 2013 World Junior Player of the Year helped Ospreys to beat Edinburgh 27-13 last weekend in Biggar's absence, one of 10 Ospreys wins Davies has played in this season.
Davies hopes to play in another win at leaders Connacht on Saturday, 27 February and wants to impress Wales coach Warren Gatland.
He said: "There's a lot of fun football for me to feed off. It's going well for me and the team at the moment, and results are going our way.
"As a youngster, you grow up wanting to play for Wales and there's definitely ambitions there.
"But I can't look that far ahead in terms of when and where that might come."
