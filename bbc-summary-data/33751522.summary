[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Plans for what the Muslim Women's Council says (MWC) would be the UK's first women-led mosque are being discussed at a public consultation event in Bradford.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The MWC is hoping to open the "all-inclusive and fully accessible" mosque in the city.
It said the space would be "for all communities and managed by women, primarily for women".
The event is at the Carlisle Business Centre and runs until 15:30 BST.
Guests include Shuruq Naguib, a lecturer in Islamic studies at Lancaster University and co-chair of the British Association for Islamic Studies, and Shaykh Akram Nadwi, a dean of Cambridge Islamic College and former research fellow at Oxford University.
The MWC said it aimed "to ensure that Muslim women have the space to discuss issues that affect them and their families in their daily lives in an environment that is open to everyone".
