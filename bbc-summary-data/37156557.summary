The 31-year-old shooter won the domestic title seven times with Team Bath and Surrey Storm, and won 114 international caps over 11 years.
Cookey will become director of netball at the Severn Stars from October.
"Netball is in my blood and being part of the new franchise is a fantastic opportunity," she said.
Cookey called time on her England career in September last year, having helped the national side to two third-placed finishes at the World Cup and two bronze medals at the Commonwealth Games.
Having won back-to-back titles with Surrey Storm, she will combine her role at the Stars with with a lecturing post at the University of Gloucestershire, where the franchise is partly based.
