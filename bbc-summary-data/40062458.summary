A fire has erupted at Wimbledon's famous tennis courts in London.

London Fire Brigade said up to 21 firefighters were called after an area of shrubbery caught fire at the All England Tennis Club at 12:33 BST.
It comes just weeks before the grand slam tournament is due to take place at the venue in SW19.
The fire, which broke out at the practice courts, close to Gate 1, has since been extinguished. The cause of it is currently unknown.
About a tonne of mixed building materials, up to 20m (65ft) of hedgerow and a small section of a temporary marquee were damaged in the blaze in Church Road, Wimbledon, the fire brigade said.
This year's championship takes place for two weeks from 3 July.
Britain's Andy Murray became Wimbledon champion for the second time when he beat Canadian Milos Raonic in last year's final.
Murray is the first British man to win multiple Wimbledon singles titles since Fred Perry in 1935.
Johanna Konta will also be seeded - the British women's number one is currently sitting at number eight in the world rankings.
