The victory saw Craig Fulton's side emerge top of Pool A in the tournament, having also defeated Ukraine and then Austria in a penalty shoot-out.
The Irish will now face Poland in the last eight on Thursday.
Ireland need to overcome the Poles and win their semi-final to keep their World Cup qualification hopes alive.
The host nation began their campaign with a thumping 9-2 win in their opening fixture of the competition on Saturday, then saw off the Austrians 4-2 in a penalty shootout after their match ended 1-1.
The Irish men are the highest ranked team in the tournament and a top-three finish would be enough to qualify for the World League semi-finals in the summer.
