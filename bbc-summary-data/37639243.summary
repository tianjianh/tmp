A coastal railway line repeatedly battered by storms could be rebuilt in Devon at a reported cost of £500m.

Network Rail wants to build a 400m (1,300ft) causeway near Teignmouth.
The project to replace the flood-hit Dawlish line, which connects the south-west to the rest of the country, would see it built about 30 yards out to sea.
The proposal is one of two options being considered by the rail operator. The other would involve stabilising the cliffs.

Julian Burnell, senior communications manager for Network Rail Western, said it was focusing on areas deemed "most at risk".
"What we've done over the last year or so is compiled an in depth study of the whole coast from Exeter down to Newton Abbot, to work out which areas are the most at risk, and which areas we need to take the most action to protect - not just for the next few years, but over the next 100 years."
The cliffs between Dawlish and Teignmouth have suffered severe damage in the past, with tracks left dangling in mid-air in the wake of storms in 2014.
The line was closed for several weeks in March 2014 and cost the economy up to £1.2bn.
Mr Burnell said that while the Dawlish sea wall is now stronger than ever, the new plans would protect it further.
"We're looking at potentially moving the rail line away from the cliff itself to protect it. That means onto the beach."
Network Rail is launching a public consultation on November 17.
The BBC understands if approved, the project could cost £500m.
Oliver Colville, MP for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport, said he did not want to see a repeat of the damage caused in 2014 and warned of the cost associated with the crumbling cliffs.
"[If] the cliffs come down as well that would be incredibly difficult, and cost the west Devon and Cornish economy an enormous amount of money," he said.
Speaking to the BBC two weeks ago, the prime minister said she was aware of the issue along the Dawlish rail line, but wouldn't commit to making funding available for changes.
