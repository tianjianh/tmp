Powys council trading standards officers made a test purchase from Palfrey's eBay account in March 2016 and sent the products for analysis, the court heard.
Results showed the hydrogen peroxide content in the gel was 5.88%, with the legal limit 0.1%.
As well as admitting to selling an unsafe product, Palfrey admitted to selling it without the correct labels and instructions.
