Seagull attacks trigger call for national 'gull summit'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A national "gull summit" is being proposed following a recent spate of attacks, including one on a pensioner in Cornwall.

Sue Atkinson was left bloodied after she was swooped upon by gulls near a primary school in Helston.
The RSPB has asked Defra, Natural England and the Marine Management Organisation to join it in talks.
It follows the prime minister calling for a "big conversation" on the issue after a dog was killed by gulls.
Mrs Atkinson, 66, had to go to hospital to have a wound on her head treated after she was swooped upon near her home in west Cornwall.
Although she understands the birds are just trying to protect their young, she believes a cull of the aggressive gulls is required.
"They are seabirds and should not be in an urban environment," Mrs Atkinson said.
"I wouldn't hurt any animal, but I just feel it's got to the stage that something must be done for the safety of people.
"What's more important, a seagull or a young child?"
Tony Whitehead from the RSPB is asking that any conversations held with academics and government officials are based around the "very best evidence" and any debate is not just about "how do we rid ourselves of the menace?"
"There's so much we need to learn about these birds," Mr Whitehead said.
"This is a real opportunity to look at how we can live comfortably with our wild companions, and do the best for both birds and people.
"The underlying issue we must address is that our seas and the wildlife which depend on them are in deep trouble.
"Delivering measures such as a coherent network of Marine Protected Areas will be a vital part of finding the right solution."
