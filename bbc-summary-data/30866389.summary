Latvian lessons are offered for Guernsey children

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Children in Guernsey can now attend lessons in Latvian to preserve their culture and traditions.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Saturday school Latvian lessons have been introduced by the Guernsey Latvian Association.
Class organisers use music and games to educate children with one or both Latvian parents.
Daiga Pabijuta, of Latvian descent and living in Guernsey, said she wanted future generations to have some knowledge of the language.
She said: "I think it's important for my son to attend because it's somewhere where he can meet other Latvian children and I think they have something between them.
"They all know everything in English and most of the time they don't know about Latvian traditions and the way people live in Latvia."
The classes are held at St. Joseph's Church Hall Library room on Saturday mornings for children aged from 2 to 12.
Lilita Kruze, president of the association, said it was important for children of Latvian parents to be able to speak the language when visiting relatives.
She said: "I think it's ok for Latvians to go abroad and have experiences and live somewhere else but also it's important to keep our traditions and keep our language so we can give it to our children and grandchildren."
