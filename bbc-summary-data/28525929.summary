[SN]TITLE[SN]
Hereford United will start new season after fourth adjournment

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Troubled Hereford United will start the new Southern League season after their long-standing winding-up order was again adjourned until 1 September.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It is the fourth time the petition, brought by former boss Martin Foyle and Revenue & Customs, has been postponed.
With some debts settled, the Bulls will meet creditors on 15 August to finalise a Companies Voluntary Agreement to sort out the rest of the outstanding bills.
Hereford begin the new season in 12 days' time against St Neots.
However, it is not yet clear where that game, scheduled for Edgar Street, will be played as the Bulls' home is still closed on safety grounds.
That has led to a number of pre-season friendlies being cancelled with other matches, including one against Turkish giants Besiktas, being played in West Yorkshire.
After being expelled from the Conference Premier for not settling their debts, the Bulls were accepted into the Southern Premier League for 2014-15 but were hit with a transfer embargo after the league initially chose not to implement it.
Monday's decision by the Royal Courts of Justice in London has satisfied the league, for now, that Hereford are worthy of their place in the division.
"I am pleased to confirm that Hereford United Football Club has transferred appropriate funds to all known football creditors apart from a few who have not, as yet, notified officials of their required details," Southern League chairman Ken Turner said.
"However, the amount covering these outstanding payments has been deposited in the account of a third party.
"Consequently, subject to receiving confirmation of receipt of all the amounts transferred and also subject to any actions taken by other authorities outside the control of the League, Hereford United (1939) Ltd will remain in membership of the Southern League and the Registrations Embargo placed on the club on 30 June will be lifted."
Despite being given more breathing space, the club still face the threat of potential liquidation when they return to court in 35 days if the structure of the CVA cannot be agreed.
