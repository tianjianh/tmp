Martyn Matthews, from Wolverhampton, was thought to have been travelling to Germany for a meeting, when the plane came down in France on Tuesday.
The 50-year-old was a season ticket holder at Wolverhampton Wanderers.
In a statement issued through the club, Mr Matthews' brother-in-law said he would have been "honoured".
Mike Lloyd said: "On behalf of the family, I would like to thank all of the Wolves fans and the club for their kind words and thoughts over the last few days.
"We have been overwhelmed with your kindness, warmth and generosity that we have received during this distressing time. It is a great comfort to see that there are so many people who genuinely care about our family."
Investigators have said they believe the plane was deliberately brought down by the co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, killing everyone on board.
Mr Matthews worked as a senior quality manager for German automotive manufacturer Huf in Tipton, in the West Midlands.
Mr Lloyd criticised some members of the media for their intrusion following the news that the father-of-two had died in the crash and reiterated the family's request for privacy.
But he said the support from the fans had helped with their grief.
"Finally, once again we are very touched and thank you for being loyal supporters of the club and our family.
"Martyn was proud of being a lifelong Wolves supporter and I am sure he would be honoured to think that his team care about him and his family so much."
