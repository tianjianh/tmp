[SN]TITLE[SN]
Elliot investor fund sells its share of Alliance Trust

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The investor fund that forced major changes to Dundee-based investment firm Alliance Trust is selling its 20% share to the company.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Elliott manoeuvred to force out the previous management and change the way Alliance Trust is run.
Having achieved an improvement in its valuation, the Elliott team has decided to sell up.
Alliance Trust has been seeking to boost its valuation by buying back shares as they come on the market.
It is now proposing to shareholders that it should buy back all of Elliott's 20% stake.
It brings to an end a long-running saga of boardroom battles, which saw off the former chief executive Katherine Garrett-Cox and chairwoman Karin Forseke.
With Elliott's nominees on the board, Lord Smith of Kelvin was made chairman and carried out a review of the way it invests.
Alliance Trust moved its focus to investment almost entirely in equities, getting out of fixed income bonds, and moving its focus away from stocks with an environmental and social emphasis.
It recently moved its funds from its in-house team to eight outsourced fund managers.
A statement from the board said that buying out Elliott's share would let it progress "against the backdrop of a share register that is settled and supportive for the longer term".
