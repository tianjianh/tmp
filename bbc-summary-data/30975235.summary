Speaking on BBC Radio Five Live, the athlete, of Woburn Sands, Buckinghamshire, said he came across the animal while walking his dogs.
He carried the muntjac two miles back to his home in a bid to save its life.
He later revealed it "had to be put to sleep due to her injuries".
The London 2012 gold medallist said he "heard the screams of a deer" and headed towards it to see what was happening
He said: "She was in a quite a bad way, the leg was broken and it seems the hips were broken after they scanned it.
"It was a tough one. The deer was crawling around a bit using its two front legs and making a lot of noise."
After spending 20 minutes trying to calm the animal down, the 28-year-old managed to wrap it in his hoodie and walk home.
He said the animal was "the size of maybe a Labrador or something" and "did start to weigh quite a lot after walking with it for a length of time".
"I'm a big animal fan and love them. With the screams it had to be in a lot of pain," he said.
"Sadly, once we got it home we could see an open fracture in her back left leg and broken hips - perhaps she'd been hit by a car or something."
The athlete tweeted he had named the deer either Melvin or Doris as he initially wasn't sure if it was male or female.
The RSPCA was informed but Rutherford took the deer - later confirmed as female - to Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital in Haddenham, near Aylesbury.
But the deer eventually had to put down as its pelvic injury was beyond repair.
"Ultimately it was much better for her to have been put down humanely and without pain, rather than being left in the woods to die over the course of a few days," he said.
"It was very sad she couldn't pull through."
