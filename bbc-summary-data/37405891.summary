Robert White car auction raises £3.5m for Dorset cancer patients

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A collection of vintage and classic motorcycles and cars has raised more than £3.5m to help cancer patients.

The items, which also included watches and cameras, were owned by photographer and retailer Robert White, who died of cancer last year, aged 62.
He was treated in Dorset and proceeds from the auction will help fund new facilities in the county, and support a number of staff training bursaries.
A 1930 Bentley four-and-a-half litre Le Mans-style tourer fetched £315,100.
The cash will pay for new scanners at Poole Hospital and new radiotherapy facilities at Dorset County Hospital.
Mr White's oncologist, Dr Mike Bayne, described the donation as a "lasting legacy".
Mr White, from Poole, started his collection after setting up a photography business in the town in 1982.
Other highlights from the sale, which had more than 600 lots, included a 1921 Megola 640cc touring motorcycle, which sold for £82,140, and a gold limited series Daniels wristwatch, which made £224,500.
He previously sold a collection of Brough Superior motorcycles to his friend, the US talk show host Jay Leno.
Funds raised from that sale are currently helping to build a new £7m cancer treatment centre at Dorset County Hospital, Dorchester, and diagnostic facilities at Poole Hospital.
The sale at Bonhams in London had been expected to raise a total of £2m.
