Full plans for new village outside Dundee approved

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Full plans for a new village on the outskirts of Dundee have been approved.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Proposals for the Dykes of Gray village to the west of the city were thrown into confusion in December when Dundee city councillors only approved half of the plans put before them.
The development management committee has now unanimously backed plans for the full 595-house development.
Springfield Properties will pay a "roof tax" for each house built on the site to go towards a new primary school.
Councillors had voiced concerns about the impact on educational provision when half of the plans were originally rejected at December's meeting.
Springfield had been required to divide the project into two planning applications, as it spans land owned by two different parties.
The first application, for 365 houses and a village centre including shops and infrastructure, was rejected in a narrow vote after councillors voiced concern about local schools being five miles away.
However, the second application, for 230 houses and a village green, was approved after one councillor left the chamber and another arrived late between votes, in scenes described at the time as "madness".
The revised application, which went before the committee on Monday, sought to address the schooling issue by including contributions towards a new school to be built in the area.
Springfield Properties chairman Sandy Adam said he was "pleased" the full village could now be built.
He said: "We listed to the feedback from the council in December and amended the points of concern in the application presented yesterday.
"We are planning to build a range of two, three, four and five-bedroom homes, all designed to complement the area.
"With planning approved, Springfield is determined to have a sales office on site as early as June 2015."
