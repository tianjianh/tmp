Scotia Gas Networks (SGN), has pumped out more than 2,000 litres of water from its pipes in Scone, but has yet to locate the source of the flood.
SGN described the incident as a "challenging emergency".
It said engineers from across Scotland had been drafted in to help with the operation.
The engineers have been visiting properties in the village to switch off gas supplies at the meter.
SGN said in a statement: "Customers can come and visit us at our incident van which is parked at the Scone Old Parish Church, Burnside.
"Our senior engineering team is also continuing to investigate where water is getting into our network.
"In the meantime, we are using specialist equipment and tankers to remove the water which has already made its way into our pipes.
"This is a challenging emergency for everyone concerned, and we'd like to assure you that we are working very hard to resolve the situation while keeping you informed about what's happening."
