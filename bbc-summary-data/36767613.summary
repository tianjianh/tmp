Two men have been given life sentences after stabbing another man to death in a street attack.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Walsh, 45, was knifed after intervening to stop his son being targeted in Hendon, Sunderland, on 20 November 2015.
Raymond Brown, 37, admitted murder and Charles Lamont, 40, was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court.
Brown, of Canon Cockin Street, must serve a minimum of 26 years, and Lamont, of Villette Street, 13 years.
Lamont's son, Dalton Barnett, 19 and of Fuller Road, was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a six-year jail term.
The jury heard that on the night of his murder, Mr Walsh and one of his sons had driven to the area after being told another son, David Richardson, was being attacked.
The court was told Mr Walsh arrived "in a mood to fight".
He was attacked by the men with an assortment of weapons.
