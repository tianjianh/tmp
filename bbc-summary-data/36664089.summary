Northern Ireland international Michael Smith has signed a new three-year contract with Peterborough United.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The 27-year-old has made 89 appearances for Posh since joining from Bristol Rovers in 2014.
He has been capped once and was named in the preliminary squad for Euro 2016, but did not make the final 23.
"I am sure he'll be knocking on Michael O'Neill's door now for the World Cup qualifiers," Posh boss Grant McCann told the club website.
