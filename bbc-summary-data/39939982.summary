Rangers should be embarrassed at finishing third, says Derek McInnes

Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes insists any club with Rangers' financial clout ought to have finished second in the Premiership and that they should be embarrassed at having failed to do so.

Aberdeen are six points clear of third-placed Rangers with two games to go.
"I find it strange he feels the need to talk about Aberdeen so much," McInnes said of Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha.
"They should probably be embarrassed that they've not finished second. I think he likes to do a lot of talking."
The teams meet for the final time this season at Ibrox on Wednesday evening with the Light Blues trailing the Scottish Cup finalists with a vastly inferior goal difference in addition to the six-point gap.
Rangers scored three late goals at Pittodrie last month to record a 3-0 win, that following a 2-1 win apiece earlier in the season.
However, it is the Dons who will finish runners-up to champions Celtic, albeit 30 points behind Brendan Rodgers' team.
McInnes, who has also led Aberdeen to the Betfred Cup final this season, feels the Portuguese is misguided about his targets in his early days as Rangers manager.
"If he thinks that is doing brilliant at Rangers, being on the up by finishing ahead of Aberdeen, then he's clearly mistaken," added the Aberdeen boss.
"His job as Rangers manager is to finish above Celtic and he should be more concerned about that challenge.
"For us, any team that finishes above Rangers in the league, with the budget they have, is doing their work well.
"And I think that any SPL (sic) manager, with the budget they have, would finish second in the league.
"The Rangers fans over the last few years have been used to either owners, managers or players saying what they want to hear but the reality is his job as Rangers manager is to finish above Celtic.
"If he thinks he's doing well by finishing above Aberdeen and the rest, he'll soon find out that's not enough."
