Ecotricity wants to build 16 turbines on land near Duns in Berwickshire where there is an "isolated landscape" and "high wind speeds".
Councillors have also been asked to reject plans for an eight-turbine development at Larbrax Moor, near Leswalt in Wigtownshire.
However, planners have recommended they approve proposals for a nine-turbine wind farm near Glenluce.
Ecotricity will apply to the Scottish government for permission to build at Inch Moor, near Duns.
The firm said it wants to build turbines that measure 126.5m (415ft) in height.
It claims the project could meet the energy needs of about 36,500 homes.
Meanwhile, Dumfries and Galloway Council planners have recommended that Brookfield Renewable's plans for Larbrax Moor are refused.
They claim it would have a "significant and adverse impact on the landscape".
There are 10 wind farms either operational or under construction within a 30km (19 miles) area of the site.
Scottish Natural Heritage has also raised "significant and serious concerns" about the impact of the project on the landscape.
In papers submitted to the council, the developer claimed the project would generate 20MW of electricity over its 25-year lifespan.
The turbines would be 100m (328ft) high and they would stand on a 558 hectare (1,379 acres) site.
The application has drawn 59 letters of objection, including those from the South Rhins Community Development Trust and Wigtownshire Chamber of Commerce, and 134 in support.
Plans for the wind farm near Glenluce are expected to be approved by the same council.
Under plans submitted by WilloWind Gass, the turbines would fill a gap between the operational Artfield Fell wind farm and the Airies wind farm, which has been approved but not implemented.
Planners have recommended it is approved, subject to strict conditions.
