Poorly children diverted as Worcestershire ward shuts

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Poorly children had to be diverted to hospitals dozens of miles away after a children's ward became full.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The situation at Worcestershire Royal Hospital is now being monitored by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
The paediatric ward was closed to admissions on 18 November and 8 December after coming under "increased pressure", the CQC said.
The hospital said it was still able to treat young people elsewhere in the hospital on the December occasion.
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals Trust is relying on beds in Worcester having closed its children's ward in Redditch in September.
Sources have told the BBC that ambulances carrying children have been diverted as far afield as Coventry, Hereford and Dudley.
One mother, Louise George, whose daughter Isabella has been hospitalised six times due to asthma attacks, said she was shocked by the revelation.
"When you need medical care, you want to get somewhere as soon as possible," she said. "You don't want to go as far as Hereford. It's not safe."
Paramedic Stuart Gardiner voiced his concerns in September about the safety in carrying extremely sick children long distances.
The CQC, which tracks safety in hospitals, has confirmed it was made aware of the two closures.
"We will continue to monitor the trust closely and work with relevant stakeholders," a spokeswoman said.
The Trust said it experienced increased pressure on 18 November.
"As a result, some ambulance conveyances were diverted to other hospitals to help us manage the pressure," a spokesman said.
"This is something that is enacted to ensure that the NHS is able to manage periods of high demand."
On 8 December, it said it did not refuse admission to any child, but it may not have had available beds at the time of admission.
