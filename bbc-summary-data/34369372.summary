A spokesman for the service said some stations deal with 200 calls a year and others as few as 15.
Stations needing new recruits include Wigton, Cockermouth, Keswick and Milnthorpe.
The fire service said recruits must be able to attend training every week and be able to get to the station within five minutes for emergency calls.
