[SN]TITLE[SN]
Jedburgh whisky distilleries receive unanimous support

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two whisky distilleries near Jedburgh have received unanimous support from councillors in the Borders.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
They approved in principle the Â£40m complex south of the town around the former Jedforest Hotel.
About 50 jobs could be created by the two-phase development being proposed by Mossburn Distillers.
The project needs clearance from the Scottish government due to potential flooding issues raised by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.
The first phase of the development between 2017 and 2018 would see a small distillery built to educate visitors in the "craft of making spirit".
A larger-scale distillery, capable of producing millions of bottles per year, would be completed by 2021.
