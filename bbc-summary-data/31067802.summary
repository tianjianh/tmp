Andy Murray's form strikes a blow against sexism in tennis

Andy Murray's Australian Open semi-final win was a seminal moment, and not just for the Scot's career.

There's no doubt he's getting back to his best form just in time for his fourth final, but he's striking a blow against sexism in tennis too.
In early 2014, Murray split with his then coach Ivan Lendl - who'd helped Andy become a Grand Slam champion.
His decision to replace Lendl with Amelie Mauresmo prompted more than a few raised eyebrows.
Never before had a top male player hired a woman as coach (except for Jimmy Connors but the woman in charge of his game was his mother Gloria, so it doesn't count).
The early signs for the new partnership weren't good.
Murray appeared to be slipping back into some bad habits, playing defensively and berating himself in the process.
Despite a late season surge, 2014 was Murray's most forgettable year since establishing himself as one of the "Big Four".
Had Murray continued his iffy form into the Australian Open, there's no doubt the vultures would have been circling over the Murray-Mauresmo axis.
But they'll have to wait as his early season form is arguably better than ever.
His play against Tomas Berdych had Mauresmo's finger prints all over it - full of variety and controlled aggression.
It was certainly Grand Slam-winning form, and if he can keep it up a first Australian Open title is definitely on the cards.
"A lot of people criticised me for working with her," Murray said in his on-court interview.
"So far this week we've shown that women can be good coaches as well."
Mum Judy has always played a strong role in Andy's career, and she hailed the impact Amelie was having off the court, describing her as a "calming influence".
Many male players have been dismissive of the women's game, albeit not as noisily as in the past.
The 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek famously dismissed 80% of the women's tour as "fat pigs" in 1992.
Last year, Rafael Nadal's uncle Toni criticised the appointment of a woman as Spain's Davis Cup captain.
"Men's tennis isn't the same as women's tennis," he said.
If Andy can win the Australian open under Mauresmo's tutelage you wonder if uncle Toni might consider changing his view.
