The 27-year-old will be riding Nicky Hayden's 2016 World Superbike spec Honda CBR1000RR in both the Superbike and Senior TT races.
Fermanagh man Johnston said: "I want to be back at the front again, winning races and I think this is the bike that can help me to do that."
He will also campaign Hondas in the Superstock and two Supersport Races.
He continued: "I had plenty of offers for this year and in the end it was all of the little things coming together that sealed the deal.
"I'm hungrier than ever and I just want to win more races."
Johnston made his TT debut in 2012 and has a best lap of 130.851mph.
Johnston will also ride for the team at the North West 200, Ulster Grand Prix and Macau Grand Prix international road races.
"I'm really glad to have my team sorted for 2017 and to have finally announced it after a few months of speculation.
"I'm really happy with the new team, it's pretty similar to my last team in terms of its size and the way of doing things, I get to have my input into things and I think it's a good fit.
"The machinery I'll be riding this year has me pretty excited; Ten Kate is preparing both my superbike and 600 in Holland and it's great that they want to be involved with road racing."
