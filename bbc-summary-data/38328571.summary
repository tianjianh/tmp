The Welsh have faced the four-time World Cup winners 14 times, but have not hosted the world's second-best side for almost 20 years.
The two Tests will be held on consecutive days from 7 February at the Sport Wales National Centre in Cardiff.
"This will be an exhilarating event for the ever-growing netball community in Wales," Welsh Netball chief executive Sarah Jones said.
