The 64-year-old Italian, whose current deal expires in 2018, guided the Foxes to a shock success after replacing Nigel Pearson in July 2015.
"When we talk about something, it's long term," said Foxes vice-chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha.
Leicester started the season as 5,000-1 outsiders for the Premier League title but won it with two matches to spare.
Almost relegated last season, they are 10 points clear of second-placed Tottenham with one match left, having lost only three league games.
Former England and Foxes striker Gary Lineker described their title victory as "the most unlikely triumph in the history of team sport".
Italian Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio said on Monday he wants former Chelsea boss Ranieri to coach Italy to a World Cup triumph in the future.
Srivaddhanaprabha said of a possible new contract for Ranieri: "At the end of the season, we will talk about that with him.
"I like people to work for me when they are happy and enjoy working with the group of people."
