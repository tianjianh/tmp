Matthew Scrimshaw, 37, was driving on the wrong side of the road when he hit Iris Higginson, 67, in December 2014.
A jury at Nottingham Crown Court was told Scrimshaw was also 1.75 times over the blood alcohol limit.
The judge said it was the longest sentence he had passed for death by dangerous driving in a 30-year career.
Ahead of the crash Scrimshaw's Audi TT was captured on CCTV on Mansfield Road, Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, at speeds of 88mph (142km/h) and 95mph (153km/h), the trial heard.
Mrs Higginson died at the scene when her Vauxhall Corsa was hit almost head on.

The court heard she "had been doing absolutely nothing wrong".
Scrimshaw made no attempt to comfort her, help her or call the police and left the scene to hide the fact he had been drinking, the prosecution said.
Judge Michael Stokes, who also banned Scrimshaw from driving for 15 years, said: "I have had to deal with some appalling cases involving extremely dangerous driving, but I cannot recall a case of a defendant who has demonstrated such an overriding contempt for the law and for the feelings of other people."
The jury also found Scrimshaw guilty of causing serious injuries by dangerous driving in relation to a friend who was a passenger in his car. He suffered a broken jaw and foot.
Speaking outside court, Ms Higginson's daughter-in-law Pauline Hotchkiss described her as "a wonderful lady".
She said the family had received justice "but we will not get over" the death of the great-grandmother.
A decision was taken not to proceed on charges of failing to stop at an accident, driving with excess alcohol and failing to report an accident.
Det Sgt James Greely, of Nottinghamshire Police, said it was some of "the worst driving I have ever investigated".
