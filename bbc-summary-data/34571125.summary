A man with motor neurone disease (MND) has used a professional networking site to name Monday as the day he will die at a clinic in Switzerland.

A message on Simon Binner's LinkedIn profile read: "I died in Switzerland with Eternal Spirit on 19 Oct 2015 and my funeral was on 13 Nov 2015."
He added: "There is nothing that I can say that's positive about MND."
In a YouTube video his wife Debbie Binner said he "strongly" believed he had the right to choose when he died.
The businessman, a 57-year-old Cambridge University graduate from Purley, Croydon, wrote that the disease accelerated "very rapidly" after he was diagnosed in January.
He added: "I don't recommend MND! Better to have one massive fatal stroke or be killed instantly by a drunk driver! "
In the video, Mrs Binner said her husband was rushed into choosing when he would die because assisted suicide is illegal in the UK.
She added: "He doesn't want to go to Switzerland and he doesn't want to go into a hospital. He wants to be at home as much as possible with his friends and family.
"And I think the most important thing to say is that Simon believes if that was available in the UK he may well want to stay alive longer.
"Christmas would be lovely for us to have Simon."
Mr Binner said: "I don't want to go to Switzerland either.
"I want to be here for Christmas but I can't be because I don't know. I have to go."
