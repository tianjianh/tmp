Dani Alves: Man City boss Pep Guardiola considering bid for Brazil full-back

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola could turn to Juventus' Dani Alves to strengthen his full-back options.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
City do not have an experienced right-back after releasing out-of-contract duo Pablo Zabaleta and Bacary Sagna.
Guardiola has been linked with Tottenham's Kyle Walker but is understood to be considering whether to bid for 34-year-old Alves, who played for Juve in their Champions League final loss to Real Madrid on 3 June.
It is thought Juve want £5m for Alves.
Guardiola knows Alves well having brought the Brazil international to Barcelona from Sevilla for £23m in 2008.
The pair won three La Liga titles, two Spanish Cups and two Champions Leagues together before Guardiola left the Nou Camp in 2012.
