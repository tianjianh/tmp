Election 2015: The friends buying together to get on property ladder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Let's be honest, if you're a young adult wanting to buy your first home the general feeling is it's nearly impossible.

New figures show that house price growth is finally slowing down, a bit.
But for first-time buyers the average price of a property has actually gone up by 9.7% year-on-year - that's larger than the increase facing previous owners.
And in January the average price paid by a first-time buyer was Â£210,000.
Getting a together a deposit to match that kind of figure is often the hardest part of the process. But Newsbeat met two friends from Preston who found a new way.
Oliver Wood, 21, and Adam Whybrow, 25, decided to buy a house together after a chat down the pub.
"Adam and I are friends and we realised we're in a similar place financially," says Oliver, who works as an engineer.
"It seemed quite sensible to split everything between us and buy a house."
They moved back in with their parents after graduating from university and saved up a deposit while working.
"We are lucky, we've got nice parents who are willing to let us stay at home and willing to let us save up to fund a deposit to put down on a house," says Adam, who works as a teacher.
Oliver adds: "By living at home and paying limited board I was able to save up quite a lot of my earnings every month.
"I didn't live particularly extravagantly, I wasn't going out every night of the week at all."
Over the course of two years they managed to raise about Â£11,500 each.
The search for a house then began and eventually they found a three-bedroom property near where they lived.
Even better, it needed a lot of work.
Oliver leads Newsbeat through the front door and the first thing you see is a loose staircase leading up to a breezy loft.
They plan to finish it all in about four months, with a lot of help from Oliver's dad, which is handy.
Once it's all sparkling and finished, Oliver and Adam won't be moving in together.
Adam laughs and says: "I have no interest in living with Oliver, he'd do my head in."
Oliver agrees: "That was never the plan."
The plan is instead to sell the property off to raise more cash for deposits towards their individual homes.
Moving back home has undoubtedly been a key factor in their success, and it's becoming increasingly common.
More than a quarter of young adults (that's 20 to 34-year-olds) in the UK now live with their parents.
In our exclusive Newsbeat survery ahead of the General Election, you listed housing affordability as a big issue.
But low interest rates mean housing is becoming more affordable and that's why Oliver and Adam were keen to become homeowners.
"There is this commonly-held belief in this country that if you're not on the housing market then you're somehow wasting your time," says Adam.
"Renting is seen as a bit of a dirty word in this country and it's dead money."
Oliver agrees and feels that getting on the market as soon as possible is the best move.
"My view is that when you rent you're paying someone else's mortgage."
Adam thinks it's a shame they won't be moving in to the house but thinks it's a means to an end.
"The more time you spend here the more it feels like a home, even though there's no furniture or wallpaper," says Adam.
"The amount of time spent scraping a wall, you know, you can get attached to that wall."
Newsbeat will catch up with them in a few months to see what the finished product looks like.
Conservatives: First-time buyers in England under the age of 40 would be able to buy a house at 20% below the market rate, with 100,000 starter homes to be built for them.
Labour: Build 200,000 houses a year by 2020, including new towns and garden cities.
Lib Dems: Build 300,000 houses a year, with up to five new garden cities in Cambridgeshire, Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.

Plaid Cymru: Oppose the spare room subsidy. Introduce stricter rent controls. Insist on written tenancy agreements.
UKIP: Protect greenbelt land by incentivising the building of affordable homes on Brownfield sites.
