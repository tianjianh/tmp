Hull, 20, shot a five-under round of 66 to move to eight under, two adrift of South Korean leader Inbee Park.
American Stacy Lewis produced the best round of the day - an eight-under-par 63 - and is one shot behind Park at the halfway stage.
Britain's Catriona Matthew, 46, moved from tied 26th at the start of play to a share of 13th position on five under.
This is the first women's Olympic golf event since 1900 and the third round will be played on Friday before Saturday's final round.
Hull made a mixed start on day two, posting a birdie at the first, but bogeying the second before further birdies at the sixth, seventh, 16th, 17th and 18th.
"I hit some great shots," said Hull. "I've played the course a few times and know where to hit it.
"I feel I am representing my country every week, but this week you know you are part of a team.
"It's pretty cool, not many people can say they're an Olympian. It's a good thing to have on my CV."
Matthew, level par after day one, started her second round with birdies at the first, third and fifth holes.
The Scot also picked up shots at the 10th, 16th and 18th, with her only bogey of the day coming at the 14th.
Park, ranked fifth in the world and a winner of seven major women's titles, claimed three birdies in the final four holes to take the lead at the halfway point.
The leaders go out in reverse order on Friday, with Hull beginning her round at 15:09 BST and in the same three-ball as Park and Lewis.
Matthew starts her third round at 14:25 BST.
Meanwhile, Brazil's Victoria Lovelady became the first player in the Olympic Games to be penalised for slow play during her second round.
Lovelady, 29, was given a one-shot penalty on the 15th hole, turning what should have been a par into a bogey.
"I tried to refute it, tried to appeal, but I didn't have enough argument to convince them," Lovelady said after a 75 left her 12 over par.
"There was a lot of interruption noise from the crowds, which is normal. I had to back off a lot of shots."
