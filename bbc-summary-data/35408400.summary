About 6.5 tonnes of rubbish has been removed from a bridleway in Lincolnshire.

West Lindsey District Council said land at Swallow on the A46, near Caistor, had become a "dumping ground for fly tippers".
Paperwork found among the rubbish revealed the waste was "likely to be from various house clearances in the Grimsby area", the authority said.
It is working with the police to identify those responsible.
The authority said it had taken seven members of staff four hours to clear the site of debris, which included fridges, mattresses and tyres, at an estimated cost of £1,500.
Lesley Beevers, regulatory team manager at the council, said: "No sooner has one lot of rubbish been cleared than another load appears. In November, we cleared around four tonnes of waste from the same spot, costing more than £900."
Councillor Owen Bierley  said: "It is important for residents and landlords alike to make sure that their waste is disposed of by properly registered companies.
"Simply paying cash to anyone with a van to take away your waste is not acceptable and could leave you facing a fine of up to £5,000 for not checking where your waste is going to."
