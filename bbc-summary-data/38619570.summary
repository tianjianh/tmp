[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Southend United's game against Bolton Wanderers in League One has been called off because of a frozen pitch.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Following the referee's inspection of the playing surface at Roots Hall, the match was postponed at 10:45 GMT.
The Shrimpers say covers and heaters were put in place on the pitch, but temperatures dipped to well below freezing in Essex overnight.
Southend are seventh in League One, one point outside the play-offs, and Bolton are third.
