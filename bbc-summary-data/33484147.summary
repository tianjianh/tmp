[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
John Shearer, 29, from Fauldhouse, West Lothian, admitted at Inverness Sheriff Court to driving dangerously on the A96 Inverness to Nairn road at Gollanfield.
The offence happened at about midnight on 7 December last year.
Defending Robert Sheridan admitted that his client had an appalling record for road traffic offences.
On this occasion, Mr Sheridan said Shearer had been concerned about his recently born child.
The solicitor told Sheriff David Sutherland: "He was working in Inverness at the time and returning to his digs in Nairn.
"He had two missed calls from his partner and mother of their two children, one of which was recently born.
"He tried to phone her and she said something about the youngest child before the battery on his phone went dead.
"He was worried and speeded up to get to his accommodation as soon as possible to get his phone charged up again to be able to contact his fiancée and find out what was going on."
Sheriff Sutherland told Shearer: "Your record is frankly appalling and with some hesitation I will not send you to jail today.
"The court is aware of the dangers that exist on this road and the fine will reflect the seriousness of the offence.
"But if you fail to pay one instalment, the alternative of prison will apply."
