[SN]TITLE[SN]
Selkirk site with William Wallace links seeks safer future

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ideas are being sought to safeguard the future of a medieval Borders kirk where it is believed William Wallace was appointed Guardian of Scotland.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
It comes after an archaeological survey in Selkirk which uncovered underground remains of a medieval chapel.
It is now hoped that a Friends of the Auld Kirk group can be established to encourage community support.
A meeting has been arranged as part of the Selkirk Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme (CARS).
It will take place on 24 January at the town's County Hotel.
Project officer Colin Gilmour said: "We were hopeful that the discovery made during the archaeological survey and the resulting events last September would encourage the development of further initiatives to secure this important site for the future, and this public meeting is the first step.
"We need to develop ideas and projects to safeguard the site for the future, enhance its interpretation and ensure its upkeep, and the support and involvement of the local community is key to that."
