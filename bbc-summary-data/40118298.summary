Bury: Joe Skarz's re-signs and Adam Thompson joins

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
League One side Bury have re-signed defender Joe Skarz on a two-year deal and brought in Southend centre-back Adam Thompson on a three-year deal.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Skarz, 27, made 145 appearances for the Shakers before he was released at the end of the 2012-13 season.
He has joined after he left Oxford United by mutual consent.
Northern Ireland international Thompson, 24, parted company with Southend after three seasons with the Essex outfit.
"I have seen Adam operate at close quarters this season and he was very impressive," boss Lee Clark told the club website.
"Joe is accomplished at left-back but he can also give us that cover as a left-sided centre-half which is a big factor."
