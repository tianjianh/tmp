Son of swindled dementia woman seeks power of attorney change

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The son of a pensioner swindled out of her savings by a friend has called for a change in the power of attorney law.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Margaret Rigby, 80, from Betteshanger, near Deal in Kent, was given power of attorney over Barbara Lewis's bank account when she developed dementia.
She was convicted last year of defrauding Mrs Lewis out of Â£57,000 from 2007 until her death in 2011.
Nick Lewis said an annual review of his mother's account detailing the debits and credits would have shown the fraud.
Rigby, of Burnt Barn Cottages, was given a two-year jail sentence suspended for 18 months after being found guilty of fraud by abuse of position.
Her daughter and son-in-law, of the same address, were convicted of acquiring criminal property.
Canterbury Crown Court heard that Rigby spent Mrs Lewis's savings on meals out, credit card bills, Take That tickets, cars, a caravan, haircuts, a coffee machine and a chicken coop.
Mr Lewis, who lives in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, said his mother had been "abused" by someone who had been her friend for 40 years.
He said the power of attorney was initially signed in 2003 but it did not come into effect until 2007, when his mother's illness was diagnosed.
Rigby had sole control of everything, but nothing was checked, he added.
Mr Lewis said he was calling for a change in the law which would see the person with the power of attorney having to annually present the opening balance of the bank account, along with details showing money that had been credited and what had been spent.
He said his local MP, Jeremy Wright, who is also the Attorney General, would be taking the matter up with the justice minister.
"He told me that having gone through the case with him there is merit in what I've said," Mr Lewis added.
An asset confiscation hearing is due to be held at Canterbury Crown Court on 18 January to  determine if any of the money can be recovered.
