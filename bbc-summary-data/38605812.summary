[SN]TITLE[SN]
Lincoln City 2-0 Dover Athletic

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Lincoln extended their lead at the top of the National League after beating fellow promotion-hopefuls Dover.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The hosts, who beat Championship side Ipswich in the FA Cup on Tuesday, broke the deadlock after nine minutes when Dover defender Tyrone Sterling turned Sam Habergham's cross into the back of his own net.
Dover came close to levelling things up on the brink of half-time but Ricky Miller's hooked effort was kept out by Imps goalkeeper Paul Farman.
Both teams hit the woodwork in the second period, with Sean Long's cross-cum-shot clattering the bar in the 46th minute and Miller's free-kick clipping a post after 62 minutes.
Dover pushed for an equaliser as the second half wore on but it was Lincoln who found the back of the net seven minutes from time when Terry Hawkridge drilled in from the edge of the area.
