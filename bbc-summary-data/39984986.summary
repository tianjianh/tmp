Diving bans: Howard Webb backs FA retrospective action

Former Premier League referee Howard Webb has backed the introduction of retrospective bans for simulation - saying the reward for diving currently outweighs the risk of punishment.

As of next term, a Football Association panel will review footage each Monday looking for cases and any player found unanimously guilty would be banned.
Webb says that the football authorities "need to shift the balance" on diving.
"The risk/reward for players to dive is not in the right place," he said.
"If a player is thinking 'if I hit the deck I can get away with it and get a penalty and if I get caught I get a yellow card' that is not much of a deterrent. This new measure will be hopefully."
The FA says it will act "where there is clear and overwhelming evidence to suggest a match official has been deceived by an act of simulation".
But only incidents that result in a player winning a penalty or lead to an opponent being sent off - through either a direct red card or two yellow cards - will be punished.
The panel will consist of one former match official, one ex-manager and one ex-player.
Webb, who is overseeing the introduction of video refereeing in Major League Soccer, explained that retrospective suspensions for simulation already occur in the US.
He told BBC Radio 5 live's Friday Football Social: "On a Monday morning, the disciplinary committee look at all the controversial plays from the weekend.
"If they involve simulation then - providing the five-man panel are unanimous - that player will then get suspended.
"It works. Players come here knowing that if they dive and got away with it on the day they will pay the price later down the road."
