An Irish tricolour and another flag appeared on flag poles over Parliament Buildings for a time on Wednesday.
Contractors working at Parliament Buildings have been asked for a report by the assembly authorities.
The contractors are working on the site renovating parts of the roof and fourth floor.
The assembly said that the flags were removed as soon as it was made aware of them.
Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin briefed members of the Assembly Commission on Thursday about the incident and confirmed that the assembly would suspend any investigation as a police investigation is ongoing.
The move was criticised by DUP assembly member Paula Bradley who is a member of the Assembly Commission.
"The assembly is attempting to hide behind the ongoing police investigation to delay any proper investigation into the obvious security breakdown which allowed someone to erect an unauthorised flag on Parliament Buildings," she said.
Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness has described the fallout as "much ado about nothing".
"I think we have far greater problems to deal with," the deputy first minister said.
"I would prefer to keep the focus on trying to find a way forward so that we can continue to deliver for all of the people that we represent."
However, Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott said people should respect Northern Ireland's constitutional position.
"Clearly, what we want to make sure of is that people respect the constitutional position of Northern Ireland.
"Maybe it was a prank.  If people come forward and accept what they did, that would be possible."
John Dallat of the SDLP said he believed it was a prank and he did not feel provoked by it.
"The previous day, I went up to Stormont to do my work and there were two union flags. I didn't get palpitations," he said.
"We are in a pluralist society - perhaps we should put one flag on the roof for each tradition and keep everyone happy."
TUV leader Jim Allister said it was "a serious breach of protocol and absolutely unacceptable".
