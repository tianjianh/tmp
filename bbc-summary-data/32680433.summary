Connor Scott beat five other finalists after they all performed before a panel of leading dance experts at Sadler's Wells in London.
The award was presented by Cuban ballet star Carlos Acosta - but only after a slight hitch in proceedings.
Acosta appeared uncertain as to who had won the prize, seeking confirmation before announcing Scott's name.
Each finalist was judged on technical skill, creative expression and overall performance after premiering a new piece created for them by an emerging choreographer.
In addition to Ride, created for him by choreographer Patricia Okenwa, Scott performed his own piece, Get Up, and Blood Snow, a duet with Meshach Henry.
The dancer's efforts were assessed by a panel that included the choreographers and directors Matthew Bourne and Wayne McGregor and Tamara Rojo, English National Ballet's artistic director.
"Just to share the stage with such talented dancers is one thing, but to win the competition is amazing," said Scott, after being crowned the winner in a ceremony shown on Saturday on BBC Two.
Scott started dancing Latin and Ballroom when he was three but moved on to other styles, including breakdancing, ballet and contemporary dance.
He recently had a successful audition at a major London school and will start full-time training in September.
