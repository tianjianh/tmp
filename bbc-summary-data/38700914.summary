[SN]TITLE[SN]
AFC Wimbledon 3-1 Rochdale

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Three goals in five second-half minutes propelled AFC Wimbledon to victory over 10-man Rochdale at Kingsmeadow.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
At the end of a goalless first half, Keith Keane picked up his second yellow card to leave Rochdale to battle for 45 minutes with a man less.
And the hosts made them pay, with Sean Kelly, Lyle Taylor and Dean Parrett all netting in quick succession before Callum Camps grabbed the visitors a consolation.
Rochdale were the better side in the first half but were unable to find a way through, and Keane picked up a second yellow card after bringing down Darius Charles on the stroke of half-time.
Seven minutes after the restart AFC Wimbledon then went ahead, with Kelly heading home from a corner, before Taylor doubled the lead moments later as he pounced with a close-range finish.
And on 58 minutes Parrett thumped home a penalty after Andy Barcham was brought down by Matthew Lund.
Camps unleashed a long-range effort after 65 minutes that proved too much for James Shea, who could not keep the ball out, but it was too little too late for Rochdale.
