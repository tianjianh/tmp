The Met Office has issued an amber alert for rain in parts of central and southern Scotland, Tayside and Fife.
It has warned that up to 200mm (7.8inches) of rain could fall on high ground, over a 30-hour period.
Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was preparing for flooding similar to that which was experienced in 2009.
A spokesoman said the Whitesands car park in Dumfries would be closed from midnight on Friday.
She added that the River Nith, which runs through the town, is expected to burst its banks at about lunchtime on Saturday.
The Met Office warned that, across Scotland, transport could be disrupted and flooding is likely as the ground is saturated and river levels are high.
Their amber warning will come into force at 02:00 on Saturday and it will run until 06:00 on Sunday.
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) on Friday evening issued  35 flood warnings and 15 flood alerts across Scotland.
It said communities in Tayside, central, west central Scotland, Ayrshire and Arran, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders may be affected by flooding during Saturday.
Marc Becker, Sepa's hydrology duty manager, said: "Rainfall will be heaviest over central and southern areas of Scotland during Friday evening and throughout Saturday which will cause river levels to rise.
"River levels in the Tay, Clyde and Tweed catchments are already high and are expected to rise considerably in the next 24 hours.
"Over the coming days we will continue to monitor levels and update the public on our latest forecasts via social media and Floodline.
"We would encourage members of the public to remain vigilant and be mindful of the conditions in their locality and when travelling."

Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne has cancelled most of its Friday sailings and the rest have been disrupted. Friday sailings of Highland Council's Corran Ferry have also been affected.
Storm Desmond is the fourth storm to be named by The Met Office this winter, after storms Abigail, Barney and Clodagh.
In its latest warning, the Met Office said: "Be prepared for the likelihood of flooding affecting properties and parts of communities.
"Watercourses may become dangerous, deep and fast-flowing, while some transport disruption seems likely."
The chief forecaster said rainfall totals of between 60-100mm (2-4in) were likely quite widely.
Yellow warnings of wind and rain have also been issued for all of Scotland, except Orkney and Shetland.
The worst of the wind is expected on Saturday afternoon and evening, when gusts in the south-west are expected to reach 70mph.
The Met Office warning said: "Please be aware of the likelihood of travel disruption on roads and ferry routes.
"Winds may be strong enough to bring down trees and perhaps cause damage to buildings and other structures."
