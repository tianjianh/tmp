Alan Stubbs insists his only focus is on bringing success to Hibernian and believes Celtic will have no problem attracting a top-quality manager.

Ronny Deila will leave Stubbs' former club Celtic at the end of the season.
"The job I see myself doing is right in front of me here at Hibs," said Englishman Stubbs, 44.
"It's a huge job. Celtic is a world-renowned football club and I'm sure they'll have no problem attracting high-quality candidates for the job."
Stubbs was speaking on the day Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill refused to field questions about speculation linking him with the job at Celtic Park.
A title winner with Celtic, Stubbs concedes it is inevitable his own name will be linked with the Scottish Premiership leaders after Deila announced he would be departing.
But the former Everton defender is adamant such speculation will not cause him to lose concentration as Hibs chase promotion to the top flight via the play-offs as well as contest the Scottish Cup final against Rangers.
"This is the sport that we're in," said Stubbs. "Nothing, speculation or anything like that, will affect my concentration, or the players' concentration, to achieve what we want."
Republic of Ireland assistant Roy Keane revealed in his book that he rejected the Celtic job before Deila's appointment.
However, Stubbs dismissed the notion the Celtic job does not hold the appeal it once did for managers.
"It's going to be a fantastic job for someone, whoever that is," he continued.
"They'll get a person who will be hopefully right for the football club. That will happen over the summer.
"I don't think they're going to have any problems filling the vacancy."
Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager John Hughes is a close friend of Celtic assistant manager John Collins but can understand why Deila is leaving.
"I feel for Ronny," he said. "It is part and parcel with what goes with the Celtic job.
"If you are not bringing success at least in terms of a treble or double each year then you live or die on your sword.
"Whoever goes in there is going to a wonderful football club with great history.
"It is not a cakewalk. You have to live with the pressure of winning every week and bringing silverware.
"If you don't, then it's inevitable you lose your job."
Celtic host Ross County on Sunday and the visitors' manager Jim McIntyre is surprised Deila has decided to leave.
"Obviously there's been huge speculation surrounding him and that's what happens when you are at a massive football club and the targets are so high," he said.
