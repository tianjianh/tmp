Klukowski played 29 times in his only season at York, helping them win the FA Trophy at Wembley, but could not help them avoid National League relegation.
The 30-year-old moved to York after his release by Newport, having scored eight times in 73 games for the Welsh side.
"He is a strong guy who can play anywhere down the spine of the team," Gulls boss Kevin Nicholson said.
