A pink woollen "pussyhat" that was worn at the Women's March on Washington has gone on display at the V&A in London.

The hat was one of thousands donned at January's protest in response to Donald Trump's controversial 2005 comments about grabbing women "by the pussy".
The garment forms part of the Victoria and Albert museum's Rapid Response collection of items reflecting current global and political events.
It was knitted by Jayna Zweiman, co-founder of the Pussyhat project.
The initiative aimed to turn the 21 January march into a "sea of pink" in protest against the Trump administration.
Other marches that took place around the world also saw widespread use of the garment.
According to the V&A's Corinna Gardner, the hat became "an immediately recognisable expression of female solidarity and symbol of the power of collective action".
Other items in the Rapid Response collection include a Vote Leave campaign leaflet distributed in the run-up to the UK's EU referendum.
