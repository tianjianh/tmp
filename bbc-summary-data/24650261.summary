Barry Rogerson, 45, from Bedlington, Northumberland, squared up to Bud, from West Yorkshire's mounted section, while wearing a scarf over his face.
Almost 100 Newcastle fans were charged following clashes with police after the game at St James' Park.
Rogerson pleaded guilty at Newcastle Crown Court to violent disorder.
He was also given a six-year football banning order.
Judge Paul Sloan QC, said Rogerson had "had plenty of opportunities to move away [from the horse]".
He added: "You stood your ground and attacked the horse by punching it in the head.
"There was a risk of serious injury, the officer could easily have been thrown from the horse and could have sustained serious injury."
Rogerson previously told the BBC he was "not a thug" and was wearing a scarf across his face to stop the cold wind getting into his mouth after a "filling had dropped out".
Ch Supt Gary Calvert said: "The images of Rogerson's behaviour were seen right across the country and further afield through the media and internet coverage of the disorder.
"His behaviour is clearly unacceptable and he was widely condemned by law abiding and right thinking members of the public for his actions.
"In particular, with the next derby just days away, I'm keen to stress that this demonstrates tough action will be taken against anyone involved in such behaviour."
Well-wishers sent Bud, who was not hurt in the attack, presents to his stables and his force's mounted section received messages of support for him on Twitter from concerned members of the public.
He will be on duty on Sunday for the Wear-Tyne derby at the Stadium of Light.
