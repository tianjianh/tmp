The Tynemouth RNLI lifeboat went to the aid of the Spirit of the Tyne at 23:30 GMT as it made its final crossing between North and South Shields.
Three passengers and two crew were rescued by the Port of Tyne pilot boat before the ferry, manned only by the captain, was blown into a riverbank.
The lifeboat then towed the ferry back to port.
An RNLI spokesman said the lifeboat almost became grounded itself because of the extreme wind caused by Storm Desmond.
There was further drama as the two vessels returned to the South Shields ferry landing when the two rope parted and the powerless ferry was once again carried away,
Eventually the lifeboat crew got the ferry under tow again and assisted by the crew of the pilot launch, got it safely tied up on the landing.
Adrian Don, spokesman for Tynemouth RNLI lifeboat station, said it was a "short but incredibly difficult and dramatic rescue in a howling gale".
He said: "Coxswain Michael Nugent and his volunteer crew used their extensive experience, training, determination, and every last reserve of the lifeboat's powerful engines to rescue the ferry and bring it and its skipper to safety.
"Thankfully, no-one was hurt in the incident."
Nexus, who run the ferry, said an investigation will now be held.
The firm said: "The Shields Ferry has a very good safety record and our crew train for these type incidents all the time.
"Our thanks go to the Port of Tyne pilot boat crew and the lifeboat crew for coming to our aid."
The BBC is running a Local Live page providing updates on the weather and flooding.
