Kyle Lowes' scooter was in collision with a car on North Road, Berwick at about 22:00 GMT on Friday.
The 16-year-old, from Eyemouth, was pronounced dead at the scene.
Berwick Liberal Democrat MP Sir Alan Beith raised the matter with the North East Ambulance Service which confirmed it was investigating the circumstances of the delayed response.
Sir Alan said he had been "calling repeatedly" for an additional emergency ambulance to be based in Berwick.
"The time it took to get an ambulance in this case underlines the need for that," he said.
"We need to know the full details of how the call to the ambulance service was handled and what could have been done differently in this very sad case."
Ambulance paramedics from Berwick arrived 26 minutes after the original emergency call and three minutes after the arrival of a community paramedic from Wooler, 17 miles (27km) away.
The call-out was categorised Red 2, which has a target response time of eight minutes.
Sir Alan has campaigned to keep two ambulances in the town, although the second emergency vehicle only runs from 10:00-22:00.
A 43-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving and released on police bail.
