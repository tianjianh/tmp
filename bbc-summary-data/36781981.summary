Damien Hirst's new gallery, a partly-underground house, three educational buildings and a London estate redevelopment have been nominated for the UK's top architecture award.

The six buildings make up the shortlist for the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) Stirling Prize.
Riba president Jane Duncan said they showed "the huge benefit well-designed buildings can bring to people's lives".
The winner of the prize will be announced on 6 October.
Hirst's Newport Street Gallery in Vauxhall houses his private collection.
It will face competition from Outhouse, located in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, which is the first private house to feature on the prize's shortlist for 15 years.
The other four nominees are the Riverside Campus at the City of Glasgow college, two buildings within the University of Oxford - the Blavatnik School of Government and the restored Weston Library - and Trafalgar Place, the first whole-scale redevelopment of London's 1970s Heygate Estate.
Duncan said the gallery and the south London estate showed "well-designed buildings can breathe life and kick-start regeneration in neglected urban pockets", while the educational spaces were new landmarks "to delight and draw in visitors, improve education potential, and increase civic pride".
She added that Outhouse provided "a fantastic model for a private house - one that delights its owners and responds exceptionally sensitively to its treasured rural position".
