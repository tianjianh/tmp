Ruby-Tuesday Hobbs underwent several operations after she was hit in Plymouth city centre on Christmas Eve, the city's magistrates court heard.
Ashley Godber, 27, from Plymouth admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving and was bailed.
He will be sentenced later this month.
The court heard he had 77 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.
Ms Hobbs, who was 18 at the time, was hit by the BMW as it mounted a central reservation on Charles Street outside Drakes Circus shopping centre at about 06:30 GMT.
Fire crews cut her free at the scene before she was taken to hospital.
Plymouth magistrates heard from a witness in Godber's car that it was doing more than twice the 30mph limit when ploughed through two railings.
The man said he was "really scared" as the car "launched off down the road" and that Godber "lost it" after he "turned violently" to the left and hit the railings.
The car ended up in a bus stop on the opposite side of the dual carriageway, magistrates heard.
Another witness described an "almighty bang like an explosion" and Ms Hobbs "skidded off down the road".
Sarah Ackland, defending, said Godber was "extremely remorseful" and "deeply regrets his actions".
Nicki Hobbs, the victim's aunt, said that since the incident her niece had been "a prisoner in her own home".
She said: "She's lost so much weight where she hasn't been able to use her legs and she's in horrific pain to this day.
"It's affected not just her, but the whole family."
In a separate incident, Ms Hobbs' iPhone was stolen as she lay in the street with two broken legs.
A 35-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident, but Devon and Cornwall Police said it ceased investigations due to a "lack of evidence and no witnesses".
Godber was remanded on unconditional bail for sentencing at crown court on 18 May.
