[SN]TITLE[SN]
Gateshead 4-1 Barrow

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead ripped up the form book to hammer Barrow in the National League.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Barrow had not suffered a defeat since August and made a confident start as captain Danny Livesey tapped in Akil Wright's cross from close range after seven minutes.
But the hosts - without a win in seven games - equalised on 26 minutes through Luke Hannant's classy finish and were ahead in the 39th minute after Nyal Bell found the bottom corner for his first Gateshead goal.
It got worse for Barrow four minutes after the break when Jordan Burrow slid the ball home at the back post and Wes York put the seal on their first defeat in 20 league games with a dinked finish on 70 minutes.
