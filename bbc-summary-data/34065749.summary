The former Watford and West Bromwich Albion player, who has won 65 caps, is understood to have agreed a one-year contract.
The 31-year-old announced the deal by posting a picture of himself on social media posing with a Bluebirds shirt inside Cardiff City Stadium.
Tamas is primarily a centre-back but can also play full-back and midfield.
He is manager Russell Slade's third signing of the summer, following the arrival of former Arsenal centre-half Semi Ajayi and loan forward Sammy Ameobi from Newcastle United.
Tamas suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in September 2014 while playing for Watford and went on to play for Steaua Bucharest.
