[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor's surgery in Stroud is to close after a failed attempt to recruit GPs to replace those who have retired.

NHS Gloucestershire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said St Luke's Medical Practice in Cainscross Road will shut at the end of September.
A spokesman said other deciding factors were the practice's finances and its relatively small number of patients.
Patients have been contacted to explain how they can register with another GP near to where they live.
Helen Goodey from the CCG said the idea of a merger with other local practices had been discussed but it had been ruled out.
"We believe that everything that could have been done has been done to secure the future of the practice.
"No solution has been achieved to allow NHS services to continue to be offered by the practice or from the premises."
A spokesman said there had been difficulties in recruiting GPs, including those with "anthroposophic expertise or interest" - which is a form of alternative medicine.
Dr Michael Evans, from the practice, said: "This has been a very difficult decision, but under the circumstances there really was no other option."
"St Luke's has been able to provide anthroposophic medicine within the NHS for 67 years.
"It has been a privilege to contribute to this service and sad that it can't continue."
