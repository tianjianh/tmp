Go Ape wants to run an attraction at a site in Temple Newsam Park known as Menagerie Wood.
The company had hoped to open a ropes course in Roundhay Park, but it was called off after a public consultation.
Following the scrapping, Leeds City Council said it aimed to help Go Ape find an alternative location.

The authority has asked for the public's opinions on the newly proposed site in east Leeds.
Ben Davies, head of business development at Go Ape, said: "We remain committed to bringing Go Ape to Leeds and we know there is a lot of support from the local community for our treetop adventure course.
"We believe that Temple Newsam would be an ideal site, allowing us to bring fun and adventure whilst making a positive economic contribution to the area."
More than 3,000 people signed a petition against the Roundhay Park plans, with some local residents concerned about car parking and noise.
Councillor Lucinda Yeadon, executive member for the environment and sustainability, said: "The feedback which we have received to the idea in principle of a Go Ape attraction opening in Leeds if the right location could be found has been extremely positive.
"When completed and assessed, the results of the [Temple Newsam] consultation will help form our position moving forward."
Go Ape has 31 high level ropes courses in the UK and 16 in the US.
