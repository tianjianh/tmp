Proof Neighbours is good for your career

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
For 30 years the residents of Erinsborough's premier cul-de-sac have kept us entertained in that awkward half-an-hour before dinner.

Shark attacks; a plane crash; and surreal interludes that delve deep into a dog's subconscious mind - no plotline is off-limits for Australia's longest running soap.
But although for devoted fans the likes of Karl Kennedy and Harold Bishop are the real stars of Ramsay Street, Neighbours has proved a steppingstone to profitable  global stardom.
Although it's never been confirmed many believe Crowe based his gladiatorial Maximus Decimus Meridius, on Kenny Larkin - the mulleted, ex-con who appeared on Ramsay Street for four episodes back in 1987.
Minogue's love of music can be traced back to her days spent under over a car bonnet as Erinsborough's resident mechanic.
The pint-sized pop star found fame dressed in dungarees and sporting a huge perm as Charlene Mitchell in 1986.
When her character married Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) in 1988, 20 million people tuned in to watch in the UK alone.
We reckon Miley first set eyes on her ex when he was playing Josh Taylor back in 2007.
Josh was involved in a classic soap love triangle. He fell in love with Bridget Parker, who was also being chased by Declan Napier. So, in a bid to win dear Bridget's heart he roped in Margot Robbie (more on her later) to make her jealous.
Her performance in The Wolf of Wall Street saw her working with Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill and director Martin Scorsese.
But it was as Donna Freedman that Margot Robbie made her name. Donna experimented with her sexuality, tried to track her biological father and then 'conveniently' went to study fashion in New York just before her Hollywood career took off.
A 1990s pin-up, Spencer's Billy Kennedy adorned the walls of many a teenage bedroom.
For six years he broke hearts and hung out with best-mate Toadie, before ditching Australia to play a young doctor alongside Hugh Lawrie in hit TV series House.
Proving soap stars can not only make it to Hollywood, but have the staying power to stick around too, Guy Pearce is arguably Ramsay Street's most successful export.
The Hurt Locker, LA Confidential and The King's Speech are amongst the titles in his impressive back catalogue.
His training for such prestigious roles? Playing Mike Young - the son of an abusive father who went on to train as a teacher and have an affair with one of his pupils. Classic soap stuff.
Holly Candy (formerly Valance) starred as Flick Scully from 1999 to 2005. Towards the end of the stint on the street she managed to rip the Scully family apart by bedding her sister's fiancÃ©e.
With their differences irreconcilable, Flick left the soap to follow in the footsteps of Kylie and pursue that well worn path to pop stardom.
It didn't quite work out, with a charity single Kiss Kiss about as good as it got.
Delta did manage a credible pop career.
She'd already signed a record deal with Sony when she started playing Nina Tucker in 2002 and went on to achieve multi-platinum-selling status, with eight number one singles and three number one albums in Australia.
She was also once engaged to Westlife's Brian McFadden, dated Nick Jonas and is now a judge on The Voice Australia.
OK. So he was only in for a solitary episode, but that's good enough for us.
He was by a much more regular presence in rival soap Home and Away, before swapping his floral shirts and boardies for a hammer and cape as Marvel comic's Thor.
She's said in the past she's in no rush to return to the soap, so we're unlikely to see the former X Factor judge in any of the 30th anniversary celebrations.
But the Torn singer was an Erinsborough resident for a couple of years back in the 90s.
