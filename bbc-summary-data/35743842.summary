[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Parents at two schools have set up a patrol to monitor "atrocious parking" and report repeat offenders to police.

Angel Road Infant and Junior schools, in Norwich, have given their backing to the volunteer wardens, who speak to drivers and take down number plates.
Parent Michelle Shepherd said: "People parking illegally put children's lives at risk, so it has to stop."
Offenders face a Â£100 fine and three penalty points if police take action.
Mother-of-two Ms Shepherd said: "The parking has been absolutely atrocious for the past year.
"We approached the school and said something needs to be done drastically before someone is hurt.
"Anyone parking on double yellows, yellow zigzags, dropping off, picking up, they are being noted down and spoken to."

She added: "I am sympathetic. It's hard to get to children to school, but they need to leave earlier."
She said number plates of repeat offenders are sent to police if drivers do not heed repeated warnings.
Chris Read, head teacher of both schools, said it was happy to support the wardens.
Asked if reporting offenders to police was elevating the issue too quickly, he said: "I don't think we are elevating anything, if people are parking illegally... the rules are there to keep children safe."
Norwich City Council said it tried to send its parking enforcement team to all 40 schools in Norwich as regularly as possible.
"When a particular parking concern is brought to our attention, we aim to follow up with a visit and will take action where necessary."
Norfolk Police is yet to comment.
