[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two candidates standing in mayoral elections in east London are hoping to get elected to the position so they can abolish the post.

UKIP's Nicholas McQueen and John Foster from the Green Party told BBC London 94.9, the current system was "totally anti-democratic".
It comes after former mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office after being found guilty of election fraud.
Ten candidates are standing for the position of Mayor of Tower Hamlets.
Frontrunners in the Tower Hamlets election race, Labour's John Biggs and Independent Rabina Khan, who is supported by Lutfur Rahman, did not express support for changing the council's system of governance, but did speak of a need for more transparency in the future.
But, Mr McQueen told the debate the executive mayoral role had "caused us so much trouble here and given us a bad image" and "to get rid of the role, first you have to become the role".
He said: "I think people now want rid of this executive mayoral role. We want the councillors to have the power back with committees."
Tower Hamlets has had an executive mayor since 2010 when local people voted in favour of the system in a referendum.
It is one of four London boroughs to have the role along with Hackney, Newham and Lewisham.
Executive mayors have more control over budgets and services than their counterparts in the leader and cabinet systems of governance.
Supporters argue they are more accountable because they are directly elected by voters.
But speaking at the hustings, Mr Foster said "I think the mayoral system is totally anti-democratic and putting too much power in the hands of one person.
"It's opening the door for corruption and it's opening the door for mismanagement".
A re-election, with 10 candidates, will take place on 11 June.
