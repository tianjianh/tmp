Peterborough doctor admits child sex image charges

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A doctor has admitted a string of offences involving indecent images of children and extreme pornographic images involving animals.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dr Michael Kennedy, 52, of St Pegus Road in Peterborough, was arrested in March after police found more than 800,000 images on devices at his home.
He pleaded guilty to seven counts including making indecent images of children and possessing extreme images.
The doctor, who practised at Millfield Medical Centre, was suspended in April.
Kennedy was detained after police received information from an internet provider that devices at his address were being used to download indecent images of children.

Police obtained a warrant at which point he admitted possessing the images.
Officers seized and examined more than 80 electronic devices containing hundreds of thousands of pictures.
Almost 840,000 category C images of children were found but a further 2,000 were classified as category A - the worst level.
Det Sgt James Weston, from the Paedophile Online Investigation Team, said there was no evidence of the former doctor "offending against any of his patients" or taking any of the images himself.
However, he added: "It is clear from what was uncovered that Dr Kennedy has an unhealthy interest in indecent images of children and extreme pornography."
Following his arrest Kennedy was suspended by the General Medical Council.
At Peterborough Magistrates' Court he pleaded guilty to one count of making category A indecent images of children, one count of making category B indecent images of children, one count of making category C indecent images of children and one count of possessing prohibited images of children.
He also admitted three counts of possessing extreme pornographic images.
He will be sentenced at a later date.
