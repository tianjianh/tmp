Hooker Hughes, 20, featured for Llandovery during the 2015-16 season while 19-year-old flanker Evans has played for Scarlets' Under-18 side.
Both players have been included in Wales' squad for June's Junior World Championship.
Wales play Ireland, Georgia and New Zealand in Pool A in Manchester.
"They both enjoyed a very successful Six Nations campaign and will take confidence into the forthcoming World Championships," Scarlets general manager of rugby Jon Daniels said.
