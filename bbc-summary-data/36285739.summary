Rolinson, now living in Llandrindod Wells, was jailed for four years after a trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

He was found guilty of 12 counts of of sexual assault and one of causing a person to engage in sexual activity.
West Midlands Police described Rolinson as "a predatory offender" who told the boys they would not be believed if they reported he assaults.
One victim told the BBC: "To congratulate you for doing something right, say checking a blind spot before pulling off, he would move his hands over and start to rub your leg.
"If you did something wrong he'd squeeze certain parts of your body."
He added: "It's been such a lengthy process. The amount of stress that's been put on me and my family has been unreal."
After the sentencing, Det Insp Sarah Booth said: "Some of the victims have also said that they felt embarrassed and that they didn't want to tell their parents, because they felt their parents would be upset because they had arranged Rolinson to be instructors for them."
Rolinson must also sign the sex offenders register for life.
