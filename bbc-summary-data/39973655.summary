SNP and Labour freeze out Tories in East Renfrewshire

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The SNP and Labour are set to run East Renfrewshire Council despite the Conservatives winning the most seats.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The two parties, along with a local independent councillor, have said they will work together to protect local services.
The Conservatives took seven seats to become the largest party at the recent elections.
However, the SNP with five councillors and Labour with four have excluded them from a deal to form an administration.
This is the latest example of a deal which cuts out the largest local group.
Labour are set to run North Lanarkshire Council although the SNP have more councillors.
The Conservatives have remained in opposition in South Ayrshire.
Meanwhile, the SNP have been frozen out in Aberdeen, Angus and Argyll and Bute.
New administrations are still to be agreed at a number of councils including West Lothian and Edinburgh.
Councillor Tony Buchanan, leader of the SNP group in East Renfrewshire, said:  "I am delighted that we have reached an agreement to build on the work and achievements of the last 10 years.
"East Renfrewshire is regularly quoted as being one of the best places to live in Scotland. The administration has a shared manifesto to continue to deliver our vision of a modern, ambitious council creating a fairer future for all."
Councillor Paul O'Kane, leader of the Labour Group, said:  "We have been working with the SNP group and Councillor Devlin for the last 10 years so in essence this is a continuation of that arrangement."
