David Haye: Dave Coldwell has sympathy after Tony Bellew win

David Haye's career has reached a "sad" position, says Tony Bellew's trainer Dave Coldwell.

Haye, 36, has had surgery on an Achilles injury sustained in Saturday's heavyweight defeat by Bellew in London.
Coldwell, who once worked for Haye, said the ex-world heavyweight champion produced his "bravest performance" in fighting on while injured in the bout.
"He will always be someone I looked at and thought 'wow'," Coldwell said. "To see how it's turned out, it is sad."
Coldwell was head of boxing for Hayemaker Promotions from 2008 to 2011, a period during which Haye became WBA world heavyweight champion.
"I feel sorry for him," Coldwell told BBC Radio 5 live's boxing podcast.
"When I worked with [trainer] Adam Booth and David, he was at his best, a special athlete with special potential. I just wish him all the best now."
Coldwell was the target of insults from Haye in an acrimonious build-up to the Bellew bout, which ended with opposing trainer Shane McGuigan throwing in the towel to save a stricken Haye after he was put down in the 11th round.
Haye's future is unclear but on Monday he said he had been told by medical experts he could make "a 100% recovery back to full fitness".
Liverpool's Bellew could now defend his WBC cruiserweight title or fight for a second time at heavyweight, potentially against WBO champion Joseph Parker or Deontay Wilder, who holds the WBC title.
"I've said all along, he can't compete with 6ft 8in beasts like [IBF heavyweight champion] Anthony Joshua," Coldwell said. "Joseph Parker on the other hand, he's still learning, he's not the beast people said at the beginning."
