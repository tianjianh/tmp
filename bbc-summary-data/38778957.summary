[SN]TITLE[SN]
Port Vale 0-3 Peterborough United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two goals from substitute Junior Morias helped Peterborough United to a hard-fought win over Port Vale.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The striker scored two stoppage-time goals, after Marcus Maddison had given the visitors the lead, to help Posh avoid a third consecutive League One defeat.
After an even start, Peterborough took the lead after 20 minutes when Maddison cut in from the right-hand side and curled the ball past Leonardo Fasan.
And it was the Vale keeper, making his debut after joining on loan from Celtic, who had kept the scores level a minute earlier, denying Maddison from the spot after Callum Guy fouled Tom Nichols.
Despite coming under heavy second-half pressure as the home side pressed for an equaliser, Morias made sure of victory in the first minute of stoppage time, burying the ball into the bottom corner.
And five minutes later, the 21-year-old Jamaican added gloss to the result when Maddison played him through following a Peterborough break and he slotted past Fasan.
