Witnesses said the two-storey house in Derwent Avenue, Kingston Vale crashed down shortly after 01:00 BST.
Emergency services were called and fire crews carried out an "extensive search" but nobody was in the property at the time.
Kingston Police said basement renovations had been taking place at the property.
Neighbour Sharon Gouhar said she "heard a big boom, my dog started barking and my children ran from their bedrooms saying their rooms had shook."
She said they called the police who "asked us to vacate... It was a bit distressing".
The average price paid for homes in Derwent Avenue is £1,375,000, according to property website Zoopla.
Kingston Council said a building application for work at the property had been submitted two days previously.
An investigation into why it collapsed will now be carried out, the local authority added.
