[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A drink driver who crashed into a teenage girl on Christmas Eve, breaking both of her legs, has been jailed.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ashley Godber, 27, from Plymouth, was more than twice the legal alcohol and speed limits when he crashed his BMW into 18-year-old Ruby-Tuesday Hobbs.
Godber, who admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving, was jailed for two years and four months at Plymouth Crown Court.
He was also banned from driving for five years.
More on this story and others from Devon
Godber mounted a central reservation on Charles Street outside Plymouth's Drakes Circus shopping centre at about 06:30 GMT.
Ms Hobbs was on her way to get breakfast at McDonalds at the time.
Godber was doing more than twice the 30mph limit when he ploughed through two railings and hit the teen.
He had 77 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms.
In a separate incident following the crash, Ms Hobbs's iPhone was stolen as she lay injured in the street.
A 35-year-old man was arrested in connection with that but Devon and Cornwall Police said it ceased investigations due to a "lack of evidence and no witnesses".
