[SN]TITLE[SN]
Auldgirth turbine appeal lodged too late

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An attempt to overturn the rejection of a wind farm has failed - because the appeal was lodged too late.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Dumfries and Galloway Council turned down the five-turbine Blackwood project east of Auldgirth in May this year.
An appeal was lodged by Force 9 Energy Partners and EDF Energy Renewables against that decision.
They argued the council's approach had been "unbalanced" but the Scottish government said the appeal was out of time and could not be considered.
The developers claimedÂ that "limited environmental issues" had been given a "disproportionate weight" in the local authority's assessment of the project.
However, the Scottish government said it had "no scope to accept or consider" their appeal.
It said it had been submitted after a three-month deadline from the original decision had passed.
