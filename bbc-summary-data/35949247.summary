Southampton eased to a comfortable win over desperate Newcastle, who edge closer to Premier League relegation.

The Magpies were woeful and conceded in the fourth minute when Shane Long ran past a hapless defence and slotted in.
Graziano Pelle swept home the second just before the break and Victor Wanyama drilled in to make it 3-0 after Pelle's shot was blocked.
Newcastle barely threatened but earned a consolation through Andros Townsend's stunning strike.
The result leaves the Magpies six points shy of 17th place Norwich, who have played a game more, with six matches remaining.

Reaction from Saturday's other Premier League matches
It says a lot about Newcastle's fans - many travelling more than 330 miles - that they applauded their side off after yet another insipid display.
They provided the only solace for the players, who slumped to their ninth successive away defeat. Rafael Benitez's side now have six games remaining to preserve their Premier League status. With four of those games at home, it is possible, but not even their passionate supporters will be confident.
Newcastle went into the game having only twice won at Southampton in 16 league attempts. And after just four minutes they looked set for a fourth successive loss at St Mary's when Long drifted past weak challenges from Vurnon Anita and Steven Taylor to open the scoring.
Anita was playing out of position at left-back, while neither Chancel Mbemba nor Steven Taylor impressed at centre-half.
The best of the defensive bunch, Daryl Janmaat, slipped and injured himself in the build-up to Pelle's goal before Mane exposed further frailties on Newcastle's left side after the break, resulting in Wanyama's strike.
Yes, but the defence has to improve markedly. Under Benitez's short tenure there had been initial improvements, but Newcastle have now conceded six goals in two games.
The saving grace might be the attack. There is enough firepower through Aleksandar Mitrovic, Giorginio Wijnaldum and Andros Townsend.
Townsend, who signed in January, scored a peach of a goal, having gone close moments earlier. Sadly for the Magpies, it came when they 3-0 down.
Good, but they probably only reached third gear. They pressed the Newcastle defence from the whistle, knowing that they could force a mistake.
Long troubled the backline with his pace, while Pelle pulled both Mbemba and Taylor - who was substituted at half-time - out of position.
Jordy Clasie was once again tireless in his closing down, with Newcastle playmaker Jonjo Shelvey failing to impose himself on the contest.
The Saints are within spitting distance of a European spot and they will assisted by the long-awaited return of Jay Rodriguez. The England forward made his first appearance since October after recovering from foot surgery.

Southampton manager Ronald Koeman, speaking to BBC Sport: "The performance was not everything I wanted, because I think in the second half, we had to score more goals. We created good chances. The key to winning was how we started, with a good spirit and a high tempo.
"It's all about how you start the game. We know the situation of Newcastle. If you give them the belief at the start, it can be very dangerous. A fast goal gave us the boost to continue. There was good movement and good goals.
"It's fantastic to see Rodriguez back, first of all for the player. He worked very hard to come back. It's up to the manager to give him that game time. He will be a very good player us in the future for us. It's important for Jay to get that game time to improve. That will not happen in one or two weeks. You need more time for that."

Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez, speaking to BBC Sport: "To be fair, the last three games have been the same. I've been saying the same thing. Second half we did much better but I'm really disappointed with the first half. Everyone needs to know that we have a lot of people behind us and so we need to give everything.
"Normally when you are in the position we are in, when you start the game conceding a goal, it's not the best.
"We have to show more character like we did in the second half. We have four more games at home and we will need everyone's support there. In the second half, the team showed we had character.
"It important that everybody continues to believe. The anxiety is killing us sometimes. If we can control these things then things will change."
Newcastle host Swansea next Saturday and Southampton are away at Everton on the same day.
