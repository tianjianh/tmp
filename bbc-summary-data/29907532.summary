Ben Reeves hit the bar before his Dons team-mate Jordan Spence deflected an Adam Yates cross into his own goal.
Afobe beat keeper Chris Neal in a one-on-one to level, with Carl Baker's 25-yard shot putting the visitors ahead.
Dany N'Guessan steered home an equaliser, only for Afobe to score from the spot and set Danny Green up before N'Guessan added a second of his own.
MK Dons manager Karl Robinson told BBC Three Counties Radio:

"In the first half I don't know why we were 1-0 down, I thought we were excellent.
''I'm really pleased with the way the players have conducted themselves, to be here without six key individuals and beat Port Vale, who are galvanised by their new manager
"It was a really good win and I can't ask for much more. To score four goals away from home anywhere in the country is a great achievement.
"We've got two weeks off from football now, and we can turn our thoughts and focus to other things."
