Stuart Greener, 41, cut the boy's head, neck and hand during the attack at a property in Hudson Street, Bicester, in January.
The victim survived but underwent surgery.
Greener, of no fixed abode, pleaded guilty to attempted murder on 10 March, and was sentenced at Oxford Crown Court on Thursday.
Det Con Darren Pomroy called it a "horrific attack" which was "made worse when the victim had his mobile telephone taken and was locked inside the property".
He added: "The defendant has taken responsibility for his actions... which was an isolated and targeted attack.
"I am pleased that the victim has not had to relive his ordeal by giving evidence in court.
"Thankfully because of prompt action from members of the public and the emergency services the victim is making a good recovery."
