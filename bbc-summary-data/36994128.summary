[SN]TITLE[SN]
Chesterfield 3-1 Swindon Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Ched Evans marked his Chesterfield home debut with a match-winning performance in a 3-1 victory over Swindon Town at the Proact Stadium.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Welsh striker scored for the second game running and was also involved in the other two goals before Darnell Furlong replied late on.
Evans had been denied in the fourth minute when he met a Dan Gardner cross only for Lawrence Vigouroux to push the ball against a post and grab the rebound.
Vigouroux made another superb save to push an Evans free-kick against the bar and then bravely blocked Sam Hird's follow-up but Gary Liddle headed the rebound in from six yards.
The 22-year-old rescued Swindon again when he turned a Jay O'Shea drive behind and then blocked a Gardner shot in the 33rd minute.
But he was beaten in first-half stoppage time when Nathan Thompson's shoulder charge on Evans was judged a foul and O'Shea fired the penalty into the bottom-right corner.
Swindon improved in the second half but conceded a third in the 64th minute when Gboly Ariyibi crossed low from the right and Evans got in front of the defence to turn the ball in.
Furlong scored with a rising drive in the 88th minute but it was too little, too late for Swindon.
