[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
No formal identification has taken place but the family of Jason Chung Wai-Ho, a kayaker missing from the Arisaig area since 13 January, have been informed.
Police officers and coastguard personnel recovered the body from Rum after the discovery was made by a member of the public.
Mr Chung Wai-Ho was last seen setting out in an inflatable red kayak.
An off-duty police officer warned him not to go out because of squally weather.
Mallaig and Eyemouth lifeboats, coastguard rescue teams and helicopter and police search dogs were involved in the search operation.
