A rented cruiser grounded by a stag-do party on mudflats in Norfolk has been recovered.

The group of nine men became stuck on Breydon Water, near Great Yarmouth, when they steered their boat away from a marked deep channel.
Lifeboat crews took five hours to rescue them one by one.
The boat's owners had expected the recovery to take three weeks, but expert John Cressey devised a way to retrieve the stricken craft in hours.
Mr Cressey and his team marked a route through the mud to aid its recovery.
He said: "We waded in dry suits and life jackets along a deep gulley that the boat must have followed and marked its route.
"I believe the men were trying to follow the river wall but were getting closer to the mudflats.
"When they stopped and the tide fell they became stranded.
"About 25 years ago a boat was stuck on Breydon Water mud for about three and a half months.
"It took us about four and a half hours to get this boat back."
But it also took several days planning and a reconnaissance trip in a rowing boat.
Langford Jillings, of boat owners Alpha Craft, said the cruiser was about 600 yards (550m) from the main channel.
"We expected recovery to take up to three weeks and that would have meant visitors losing their holidays," he said.
"But thanks to John the boat was ready for its next booking.
"It's hard enough to make a living so we're glad we did not have to lose any money."
The cruiser became stranded overnight on 29 May and was back in action by the Thursday.
"It was not damaged just very muddy," Mr Jillings said.
