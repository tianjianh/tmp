The 18-year-old was hit outside the Oakdale Social Club in West Bromwich.
Police believe the Vauxhall Astra  contained three or four Asian men who were involved in an earlier disturbance outside the club.
The car pulled away from the car park but moments later turned around "and was driven into the crowd" gathered at closing time, police said.
The injured teenager was taken to hospital with suspected spinal fractures and was later discharged to continue her recovery at home.
Det Con Luke Stephens, from  West Midlands Police, said: "Exactly what led to such a dangerous and violent act is not clear, but we do know that the men used a dark blue Vauxhall Astra to drive at the group outside the club.
"Their actions could have left people with much more serious, if not fatal, injuries and it is only good fortune that prevented the young woman from being badly hurt."
He said the car would have been left with front-end damage after the incident outside the club in Oak Lane at about 23:15 GMT on Friday 20 February.
"Make no mistake, this was a serious incident and we need to find those people involved."
Anyone at the Oakdale Social Club that night who may be able to help police is urged to call the force on 101 or contact Crimestoppers.
