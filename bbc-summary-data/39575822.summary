[SN]TITLE[SN]
Nasi Manu to leave Edinburgh and join Pro12 rivals Treviso

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh back row Nasi Manu will join Treviso when his contract expires at the end of the season.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The New Zealander, 28, has had an injury-plagued two seasons in Edinburgh, making only 16 appearances.
Manu has almost certainly played his last game for Duncan Hodge's side, as he continues his rehabilitation from shoulder surgery.
He co-captained the Highlanders to the 2015 Super Rugby title before his switch to the Scottish capital.
Edinburgh are ninth in the Pro12 with three games remaining after a league campaign that has yielded just four wins.
Treviso prop up the table, eight points behind Edinburgh. The teams meet in round 20 this Saturday at the Stadio Monigo.
