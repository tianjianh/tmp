A rocket attack on a United Nations base in northern Mali has killed three people and wounded at least 12 others.

A peacekeeper died when about 30 rockets struck the base in the desert town of Kidal, said the UN mission.
Some rockets missed their target, killing two civilians. It is not clear who carried out the attack. Islamist militants are active in the area.
Meanwhile an al-Qaeda-linked group said it carried out an attack in the capital which killed five people on Saturday.
Al-Murabitoun, an Islamist group led by Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar, said the attack on a bar in Bamako was a "revenge operation" against the "infidel West".
A gunman opened fire at La Terrasse bar, killing a French national, a Belgian security official working for the EU and three Malians.
The United Nations mission, Minusma, took over security duties from France in 2013. It regularly comes under attack from militants.
On Sunday Minusma said the rocket attack on its base in Kidal occurred at about 06:00 GMT. Peacekeepers returned fire.
At least one shell fell on a nearby camp for Tuareg and Arab nomads, killing two people and injuring several children, a witness said.
Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants and Tuareg rebels have been fighting the army in northern Mali for a number of years.
France, the former colonial power in Mali, intervened two years ago to stop their advance south of Bamako.
Militancy in Mali:
Peace talks with Tuareg rebels ended inconclusively in Algiers last week.
Northern Mali has been a flashpoint of conflict since Mali's independence from French rule in 1960, with Tuareg rebels campaigning for independence or more autonomy.
The conflict has become more complex with the emergence of jihadi groups, which roam freely across parts of the Sahara desert.
