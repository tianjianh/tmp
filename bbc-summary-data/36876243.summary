Swansea boss Francesco Guidolin says he is unsure about Andre Ayew's future, but hopes the forward will stay.

Ayew, 26, was linked with Sunderland during the January transfer window and there has been reported interest from West Ham and Chelsea in recent weeks.
"Andre is a good guy and a good player, I hope he stays with us but I don't know," Guidolin said.
The manager indicated that he was waiting to hear from chairman Huw Jenkins, who deals with transfers.
Jenkins will continue to fulfil that role following a recent US takeover.
Ayew was Swansea's top scorer with 12 goals last season after joining from Marseille on a free transfer in June 2015.
"It is important to keep him, but it is not my job," Guidolin said. "My job is to train and to get the team to play well and to get good results. I am confident he will stay."
Swansea are in the market for a new striker with Eder - who scored Portugal's winner against France in the Euro 2016 final - having left the club, along with Italian forward Alberto Paloschi.
Bafetimbi Gomis, who played no part in Saturday's 5-1 friendly win at Bristol Rovers, is also close to leaving the Liberty Stadium.
Guidolin wants a striker, but says he has no idea if a deal is close.
"I don't know if we are close to signing a striker, this is a question for the chairman and the new owners," he said.
"I speak with the chairman every week when there is the possibility and he knows what we need. It is a question for him."
Guidolin gave his seal of approval to the US takeover of the club, with US investors Steve Kaplan and Jason Levien purchasing a 68% stake in the Swans.
"The takeover is good, the new owners are with us and I am happy," he told BBC Wales Sport.
"I hope to see something in the coming weeks."
