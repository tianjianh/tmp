The pro-Leave minister is being interviewed and taking questions from the audience in a Sky News special.
Mr Gove was challenged at the beginning of the interview on the economy and one of the Leave campaign's key claims that the UK sends Â£350m a week to the EU.
Mr Gove said the important thing was "we don't have control of that money".
"Every year we give billions of pounds to the European Union, billions of pounds that we should be spending hereâ€¦ on our NHS and our priorities," he said.
The referendum takes place on 23 June.
Live: Michael Gove faces studio questions
When asked whether he could name any economic authority in favour of an EU exit, Mr Gove said the big names that had come out for Remain "have been wrong in the past".
He said 300 business figures had put their name to his campaign.
His interview follows Thursday night's show which had a similar format but featured Prime Minister David Cameron, who is campaigning for Remain.
Mr Cameron, whose party is split on the EU, has refused to take part in any head-to-head TV debates with fellow Conservatives who back leaving the union.
But a number of debates and live Q&As are planned, including the BBC's event at Wembley Arena on 21 June.
Ahead of the hour-long Sky News show, which started at 20:00 BST, Mr Gove said he was feeling "nervous" but was hoping to "allay people's fears" about leaving the EU.
In his appearance, Mr Cameron was pressed on immigration from within the EU, warning that voting to Leave in order to try to control it would "trash" the economy.
Mr Gove and the Leave campaign have been campaigning hard on migration in recent weeks, calling for a points-based system for EU migrants if the UK severs its ties with Brussels.
Vote Leave said ending the principle of free movement would create a "fairer" system - but Remain campaigners said it would mean leaving the single market and could increase migration into the UK.
