[SN]TITLE[SN]
Yeovil Town 3-2 Accrington Stanley

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Olufela Olomola's brace helped Yeovil to a home win over Accrington in League Two.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kayden Jackson got the opener for Stanley in the 12th minute with an easy tap-in after a Billy Kee shot from distance was parried into his path.
The Glovers made it 1-1 on 26 minutes when Olomola broke into the area to find Otis Khan and, when his shot was blocked, the forward was on hand to score.
Having already hit the bar, Francois Zoko then gave the hosts the lead in the 38th minute as the Ivorian turned in a knock-down at the second attempt.
Less than a minute later it was 3-1 when a long ball eliminated the entire Accrington defence and Olomola did well to loft it over the onrushing Aaron Chapman.
The visitors were given a lifeline after 53 minutes when a mistake allowed Jackson in to score again, but despite dominating the second half they could not find an equaliser.
