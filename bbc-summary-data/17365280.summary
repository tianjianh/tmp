Cpl Liam Riley was killed in Helmand Province attempting to rescue his friend L/Cpl Graham Shaw following an explosion in February 2010.
The steel statue has been installed next to a bench in his home village of Killamarsh.
His mother, Cheryl Routledge, said she was delighted with how the statue looked.
She said: "We're so chuffed with it. I'll be able to drive home from work and he's going to be standing there at the at the side of the road welcoming me home."
Cpl Riley, 21, and L/Cpl Shaw, 27, from Huddersfield, were on patrol with 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, when they stood on improvised explosive devices.
Prince Harry, who trained alongside him in Canada, described him as "a legend" after learning of his death.
His statue, which sits alongside the Trans Pennine Trail on Forge Lane, forms part of a national public art installation by cycling charity Sustrans, funded by the Big Lottery Fund.
It will stand between statues of Sheffield boxer Clinton Woods and Rotherham-born Colin Savage who has campaigned to make the countryside more accessible.
Sustrans has already organised similar installations along public paths in Hastings, Northampton and Port Talbot.
