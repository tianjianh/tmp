Two motorcyclists showed "utter disregard" for road users by reaching speeds of 140mph and pulling "wheelies" on country roads, a judge has said.

Michael Groves, 39, of Rhyl, and Andrew Bennett, 48, from nearby Abergele received suspended jail terms after admitting dangerous driving in Conwy.
They were prosecuted after police recovered a head-cam attached to Groves' helmet after they collided.
Judge Niclas Parry called their riding a "flagrant disregard" for road rules.
But both men were banned for two-and-a-half years and ordered to take extended tests during their hearing at Caernarfon Crown Court.
Prosecuting barrister Paulinus Barnes said four bikers in all had been riding at high speed and Groves reached 140mph (225km) in a 60mph zone and 110mph (177km) in a 30mph limit.
The pair admitted dangerous driving during a journey of 27 miles (43.5km) on the A470 through the Conwy Valley to Llandudno and then east along the coast to Llanddulas, near Colwyn Bay, where they collided in April last year.
Patrick Thompson, defending Groves, said the collision had changed his client's life and left him "disfigured permanently".
"He's learned an extremely bitter lesson for his behaviour on that day," he said.
Bennett's counsel also said the incident had severely affected his health.
Groves received an eight-month suspended jail term and he must do 300 hours unpaid work.
Bennett got a six-month suspended prison sentence with 200 hours unpaid work.
The judge said there was a "deliberate and flagrant disregard for the rules of the road" although there was no evidence of racing.
He said there were dog walkers, oncoming cyclists and speeding in areas where the potential for a collision was "blatantly obvious".
"What occurred was the inevitable," he said, referring to the men's collision.
