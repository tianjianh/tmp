Jean Paul Gaultier has said he would have no problem dressing Melania Trump, despite designers Tom Ford and Marc Jacobs saying they would not do so.

A number of designers have declared that they would refuse a request from America's future First Lady.
But others, including Tommy Hilfiger, Thom Browne and now Gaultier, have said they would not have a problem.
Asked whether he would dress Mrs Trump, Gaultier replied: "Definitely. It's not my objective but why not?"
Speaking at the British Fashion Awards on Monday, the French designer said it was "not a question of politics".
"She dresses very well by herself," he told the Press Association. "I have nothing bad to say against her.
"She was better dressed than Hillary [Clinton] when she went to vote. She was in her camel coat and white dress and was beautiful.
"I don't know who advises her or maybe it's herself, but if she asked me to dress her, why not?"
Last month Sophie Theallet published a letter on Twitter saying she would "not participate in dressing or associate myself in any way with the next First Lady".
Theallet, one of current First Lady Michelle Obama's favourite designers, wrote: "The rhetoric of racism, sexism and xenophobia unleashed by her husband's presidential campaign are incompatible with the shared values we live by."
"Personally, I'd rather put my energy into helping out those who will be hurt by Trump and his supporters," Marc Jacobs told WWD.com last month.
Derek Lam concurred, saying he would "rather concentrate my energies on efforts towards a more just, honourable and a mutually respectful world".
"I was asked to dress her quite a few years ago and I declined," Tom Ford told US TV show The View.
But that was less to do with politics and more to do with her style, he said, adding: "She's not necessarily my image."
Tommy Hilfiger, however, offered a different viewpoint when asked about Theallet's letter.
"Melania is a very beautiful woman and I think any designer should be proud to dress her," he said.
"I don't think people should become political about it. Everyone was very happy to dress Michelle [Obama]."
