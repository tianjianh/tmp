Boris Johnson backs Donald Trump on Nato spending

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Britain will support US President-elect Donald Trump's campaign to get Nato countries to spend more on defence, Boris Johnson has said.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
In a speech, he said it could not be "justified" that the US accounted for about 70% of Nato defence spending.
He also said the UK would not seek to prevent the EU from forming a closer common defence policy.
During his election campaign, Mr Trump was critical of Nato, describing the Western military alliance as obsolete.
He suggested that the US would think twice about coming to the aid of any Nato ally under attack if it had not paid its "fair share".
The UK, which meets the commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence, has also been urging other countries to increase their contributions.
Mr Johnson, in a speech to the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House, said the UK must "redouble our resolve to defend and preserve the best of the rules-based international order" to prevent a return to "an older and more brutal system where the strong are free to devour the weak".
"We have to acknowledge that in many respects the world is not in good shape. We have the cult of the strong man, we have democracy in retreat, we have an arc of instability across the Middle East from Iraq to Syria to Libya. What is the answer of the UK, is it to cower and put the pillow over our heads? Emphatically not."
He committed Britain to the concept of collective Nato defence: "At the heart of this institution - Nato, the most durable and successful defence alliance in history - lies the security guarantee contained in the North Atlantic Treaty Article 5, that an attack on any one member shall be considered an attack against them all.
"And in offering that guarantee, President-elect Donald Trump has a point. It cannot be justified that one Nato ally, America, accounts for about 70% of the alliance's defence spending while the other 27 countries manage only 30% between them. "
He said every Nato member should meet the agreed target of spending 2% of GDP on defence, and 20% of their defence budget on new equipment.
Mr Johnson said Britain would not oppose attempts by the European Union to form a common defence policy: "You know, if they want to do that, fine. Obviously they should also spend 2% of their GDP on defence, it might be the first thing to get right, but we are not there to block or to impede further steps towards EU integration if that is what they so desire."
And the foreign secretary said that strong defence did not preclude negotiations and that he believed pressure could be brought to bear on Russia - amid tensions with Nato over Crimea and the bombing campaign in Syria.
"We can't normalise relations with Russia or go back to business as usual. But as I've said time and again, Russia could win the acclaim of the world by halting its bombing campaign of Syria, delivering Assad to peace talks, abiding by the letter of the Minsk agreements in Ukraine."
