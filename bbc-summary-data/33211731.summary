Councillor Simon Carter in court on indecent images charge

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A Greater Manchester councillor has appeared in court charged with making indecent images of a child.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Labour councillor Simon Carter, who has represented Bury Council's Tottington ward since 2012, faces 16 counts.
Mr Carter, 53, of Rakewood Avenue, Littleborough, appeared before Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court.
An ex-member of the council's Standards Committee, he was bailed to appear at Manchester Crown Court on 10 July.
A Bury Council spokesman said: "We can confirm that a Bury councillor has been charged with making indecent images of children.
"As the matter is under police jurisdiction, it would be inappropriate to comment further."
