The International Development Committee (IDC) said £20,000 would go to UNICEF in the Philippines with £30,000 helping the Human Appeal International.
More than a million people were displaced when Typhoon Koppu struck in the Philippines last October.
In Greece, work is continuing to help provide food for those fleeing Syria.
IDC chairman Phil Gawne said: "These charities urgently need funding to deliver vital food, shelter and medical supplies in countries devastated by conflict and natural disasters.
"The support from the Isle of Man will add to donations from other nations to improve the lives of thousands of vulnerable people."
