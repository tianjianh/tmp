Technician Olivier Rochette died on Tuesday, in what police have called an "industrial accident", when he was struck by a telescopic lift.
The 43-year-old had been setting up for a performance of "Luzia" in San Francisco.
Rochette's father, Gilles Ste-Croix, was one of the founders of the world-touring circus.
"I am heartbroken," said Cirque du Soleil CEO Daniel Lamarre in a statement. "Olivier has always been a member of our tight family and a beloved colleague."
Rochette's death comes just days after a serious fall left a performer in a head brace.
Australian Olympic gymnast and acrobatic performer Lisa Skinner fell during her aerial hoop routine in Brisbane on Sunday.
She broke her vertebrae and her arm, her mother said.
In 2013, a performer died during a live show in Las Vegas. Investigators said Sarah Guyard-Guillot fell 28m (94ft) to the floor when a safety wire became detached due to her rapid ascent.
The company was fined.
Cirque du Soleil was founded in 1984 by Mr Ste-Croix and Guy Lalibert√©.
With headquarters in Montreal, Quebec, it was a Canadian company until 2015, when it was bought by US private equity firm TPG Capital and Chinese investors Fosun Capital Group.
