Staffordshire Police described the finds as "significant" and thanked the public for providing information.
Two men arrested after Tuesday's raid have been released on police bail.
Ch Insp Rob Taylor, from the force, said: "This is a significant find of cannabis in the south of the city which will no longer find its way on to our streets."
