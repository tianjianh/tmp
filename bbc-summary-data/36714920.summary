Wales play Portugal in Lyon at on Wednesday night for a place in Sunday's final against either Germany or France.
Wales go into the game having won four of their five matches at the Euros.
Portugal have failed to win a match within 90 minutes - beating Croatia in extra time and Poland on penalties.
But Rui Castilho Dias, who has lived in Cardiff with his wife for the past couple of years, believes his side will win.
"I could never imagine Portugal v Wales in the semi-final," he said. "I think Portugal will win, I think they have the better team.
"We will be watching at home with Welsh friends and Portuguese friends - about 15 people."
Portuguese bakery owner Filipe Brito is making a special cake which will be on display at his Nata & Co shop opposite Cardiff Castle.
"We are going to do a big cake with a Portugal flag and a Wales flag on top, " said Mr Brito who has three shops.
"Hopefully Portugal will win but to be honest I think Wales will win because they have the stronger team.
"If Wales go through, I will be happy."
Mr Brito will be joining a mixed group of friends in a bar in Cardiff city centre.
The bar's owner is Portuguese and also has bars in Swansea.
Bruno Nunes, who runs Peppermint and Brewstone in Swansea, said he had split loyalties with a Welsh wife, children and business partner.
He said: "Portugal are ever so slightly favourites - but I think I'm obliged to say that by blood.
"If Wales win, I will be happy. I think they've got a great chance. My friends have given me a lot of stick that Wales will smash Portugal."
Rafael Baptista, a PHD student at Aberystwyth University admitted he had not watched Wales before Euro 2016 but said they were playing at a "very high level".
He added: "I think Portugal will win because of their experience in knock out stages in previous tournaments. Portugal have not played very well so far, hopefully we will see something different in this match.
"There are three nationalities represented in our laboratory - Welsh, Portuguese and French - and the dynamics could not be better.
"We will be watching it together as a research group in a local pub in Aberystwyth. I am glad to have the opportunity to watch the game with Wales fans since they are very enthusiastic."
Andreia John, from the Algarve shop in Wrexham will watch the game at home.
"My husband will support Wales and I will support Portugal and my daughter said she would be in the middle because she's half Welsh and half Portuguese," she said.
