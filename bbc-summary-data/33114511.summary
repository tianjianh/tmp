About 1,000 people attended the rave at Twyford Wood near Bourne in Lincolnshire on 23 May.
Dozens of people were arrested and litter, broken glass and other items were left on the site.
A car rally planned for last weekend was postponed while contractors worked to complete a Â£4,000 clean-up.
Lincolnshire Police said a number of officers were injured after coming under attack from missiles, including bottles, thrown by about 200 people attending the event.
A police dog was also injured by a glass bottle thrown from the crowd.
A spokesman for the Forestry Commission said contractors had removed a large amount of broken glass, which was hazardous to visitors.
He said he was hopeful the site, a former Second World War airfield, would reopen early this week.
Signs warning people not to enter the site will be removed after a final inspection, he added.
The Mid-Derbyshire Motor Club said a rally planned for 6-7 June will now take place at a later date.
A total of 48 people were arrested by police at the illegal rave. Of those arrested, 13 were charged, with 26 released on bail, while the rest were released without charge or cautioned.
