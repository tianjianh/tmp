The 20-year-old is one of four new faces in the squad for the international friendly tournament in China, that begins next week.
Mead scored 12 goals for the Lady Black Cats in their debut campaign in WSL 1.
"Finishing top scorer in WSL 1 and getting in the England squad is a dream come true," Mead said.
"It's a new challenge, it's a different ball game" she told BBC Newcastle.
"It will be different to the WSL and the international level I've played at and I'm looking forward to it, but can't wait for the experience."
Chelsea players Hannah Blundell, Laura Coombs and Drew Spence were the other uncapped players to be included in Mark Sampson's squad.
In addition to the call-up, Mead was also included among the nominees for the England Women's Young Player of the Year along with Alex Greenwood, Fran Kirby and Jodie Brett.
"I'm quite excited to be on that list, it's a massive honour," she added.
"I've been lucky enough to play for England since I was 12-years-old and I played for boys teams which has helped me develop quicker."
