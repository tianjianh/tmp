Murray Thompson, 34, went missing on 20 April 2010. Forensic tests proved he was killed in a flat in St Albans Road, Watford in Hertfordshire.
James Evans, 26, was convicted of his murder and jailed for life in 2012.
The victim's father Tony Thompson said he wanted to "get through to" Evans and have "many questions answered".
Murray Thompson, of St Albans, worked as a courier for a Hemel Hempstead firm but also tended cannabis plants with Evans, from Bushey Mill Lane in Watford, until he vanished.
Evans, who was convicted of killing Mr Thompson at a flat being used to grow cannabis, was jailed for a minimum of 21 years. The motive for the killing is unknown.
He has never revealed anything about what happened but his trial at St Albans Crown Court heard he used two accomplices to try to cover his tracks and dispose of the body, which has never been found.
Sentencing Evans, Judge Stephen Gullick told him: "I have no doubt that you know the whereabouts of that body."
Mr Thompson's family have offered a Â£5,000 reward for information.
Tony Thompson said: "[Murray] has certainly not been forgotten and will never be forgotten by us.
"If only we had some clue as to exactly what happened and where he is, it would be some sort of closure for us.
"I'd like to get through to James Evans about what grief he has caused and to have our many questions answered, not least where Murray is."
Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: "[Evans] remains in prison and will do for a long time to come, so anyone who may have information about where Murray is can come forward, safe in that knowledge."
