Tom Jones fans were left disappointed when the power failed three times during his Alnwick Castle performance, forcing the show to be cut short.

One fan said the lights went out at the Northumberland venue just as the entertainer sang the line "turn on the light" from Leave your Hat On.
Organisers, Teesside-based Loose Cannon Events, said there was an "unforeseen major technical issue".
The performance ended after about 50 minutes.
Dave Moor from Seahouses, who was at the concert, said there was "a lot of anger" from fans.
He said: "When he came on, I've got to say for the 50 minutes or so that he was playing, he was very very good.
"Then at that opportune moment, that line, 'you can turn on the light', the lights went out and that was it.
"Everybody was hanging around for about five minutes or so and then we realised nothing was happening and then somebody came on and made an announcement and said that Tom Jones had left the arena so we all trooped out."
Conservative MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, was also there.
She said: "It was so exciting, the prospect of seeing Tom Jones.
"Just as it was all kicking off, the power went. Once is funny, twice is boring, three times, the lead artist goes home.
"Something needs to be sorted out. The organisers need to consider whether they want to actually give some sort of partial refund at least to those who would have saved up to go and see this concert."
Fans are thought to have paid between Â£45 and Â£100 for tickets.
Vivienne Milne from Jarrow, who was at the concert, said: "He apologised and his words were, 'it looks like the shilling didn't drop in the meter' and he said hopefully all will be well'."
Loose Cannon Events said in a statement on Facebook: "This evening's performance with Tom Jones was unexpectedly cut short as a result of an unforeseen major technical issue.
"This is currently being investigated by independent experts, and we hope to be able to provide further information as and when it becomes available."
