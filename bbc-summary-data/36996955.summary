Ashley Williams missed Swansea's final pre-season friendly against French club Rennes as uncertainty regarding the Wales captain's future continues.

Everton had a Â£10m bid rejected for the Swans skipper, 31, who has been given an extended break after Euro 2016.
Williams' Wales team-mate Neil Taylor and Iceland's Gylfi Sigurdsson, both of whom also played at Euro 2016, also missed Swansea's 1-0 home victory .
Swansea's Premier League opener is on Saturday at newly-promoted Burnley.
However, there was a first start for new signing Fernando Llorente after the Spain striker joined from Sevilla on Friday.
But the World Cup winning forward didn't start his Swansea career the way he would have wanted as Llorente missed a glorious opportunity in the first half, squandering an open goal by hitting the post from close range.
Swansea dominated the match and eventually won it thanks to a header from Jay Fulton, who had only been on the pitch a matter of seconds having come on as a substitute.
