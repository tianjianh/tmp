[SN]TITLE[SN]
Southport 1-1 Aldershot Town

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Struggling Southport came close to securing a much-needed win as they drew with Aldershot following a frantic end to their National league clash at Haig Avenue.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Southport led after 71 minutes when James Gray broke the deadlock, only for Will Evans to equalise eight minutes later.
The hosts had looked dangerous on the break in the first half and finally took the lead when Gray finished well past Jake Cole with a well-driven shot.
Southport then looked to sit deep as the Shots pressed for an equaliser. It didn't take long to come with Evans lashing home after a brilliant counter-attack involving Jake Gallagher and Shamir Fenelon.
Shots went closest to a winner as Walker and Fenelon again combined without finding the net.
