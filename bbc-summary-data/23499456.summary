[SN]TITLE[SN]
Bournemouth 1-0 Portsmouth

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Eunan O'Kane scored the only goal as Championship side Bournemouth beat League Two neighbours Portsmouth to reach the Capital One Cup second round.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
O'Kane netted on the rebound when a Ryan Fraser shot had been pushed out by Pompey keeper Phil Smith on 54 minutes.
The Cherries were the better side throughout and deserved their win.
Wes Thomas blazed a header over and Smith produced a fine save to keep out Andrew Surman's 20-yard shot, but the hosts did not need a second goal.
Tom Craddock came closest to netting for Pompey with a rasping strike that went just wide with the score 0-0.
