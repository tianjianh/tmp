The 24-year-old joined the Gulls from Dover in January for a second spell at Plainmoor, and played 18 league games.
Meanwhile, striker Nathan Blissett has agreed terms on a new contract to remain with the Devon side.
He scored eight goals after arriving at the start of the year on a deal which was initially until the end of the season, but had an extension clause.
"We offered Toby a new contract but it wasn't right for him," Torquay player-boss Kevin Nicholson told the club website.
He added on Blissett: "There is more to come from 'Bliss' because he has plenty of untapped potential. He was great for us last season."
