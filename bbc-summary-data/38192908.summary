Ahead of kick-off, the Scottish Professional Football League and Caley Thistle dismissed reports that the club had asked for the game to postponed as a result of a goalkeeping injury crisis, with both saying they had simply sought clarification of the rules.
First choice Fon Williams suffered a back strain this week, goalkeeping coach and reserve Ryan Esson also picked up an injury having replaced Daniel Hoban, who injured himself in a midweek under-20 match.
The other senior goalkeeper, Cammy MacKay, was unavailable as he is on loan at Elgin City.
So Fon Williams started despite not being fully fit and it appeared to play a part in Hamilton's goal as he was caught out by Crawford at his near post. The Wales goalkeeper had to do better.
Inverness responded well though and were rewarded by Cole, who produced a fine finish to find the top corner from an angle.
Boss Richie Foran will also point to a very strong claim for a penalty in the first half. Lonsana Doumbouya directed a header on target with Dan Seaborne clearly handling.
It wasn't given but to their credit, Inverness continued to press.
Jake Mulraney screwed wide from close range, Tansey dribbled through on Woods but couldn't finish before Draper fired over form a great position.
When Cole struck, the game opened up - and it turned into a very good watch.
Tansey thought he'd netted but his shot was blocked. Cole blazed over. Hamilton pushed back and might have nicked a winner.
The result arrests a run of four defeats for Inverness but they'll be disappointed not to have taken all three points as a first home win since September evaded them once more.
The point moves them off bottom place, into 11th, but perhaps not as far as they'd have wished. It remains very tight at the foot of the table.
There's a predictability about Hamilton; they draw a lot. That's eight in 10 games.
You could write this most weeks about Ali Crawford, but once again, he was simply top-drawer for Martin Canning's side.
As he sized-up a free-kick on the left everyone expected a cross into the crowded box, but Crawford saw the opportunity to catch out Fon Williams at his near post with a crisp strike low to his right-hand post which was perfectly executed.
It would be wrong, though, to simply highlight Crawford - Hamilton have a real team ethic and came close from other areas.
Greg Doherty flashed wide from distance and Darian Mackinnon was unlucky with Fon Williams tipping over.
They rode their luck at times with the penalty claim and the procession of great chances going unpunished.
Accies now face a very difficult run of games against Celtic, Rangers, Celtic again, then Aberdeen.
Tough by anyone's standards, but they've been consistently dogged and in Crawford they have someone who can produce moments of spark at vital times.
Inverness CT manager Richie Foran: "We didn't get a clear, clear penalty - not only has (Seaborne) hand-balled it, he's pushed it with his hand and the referee is in the best position to see it, looking straight at it.
"It's interesting. Very interesting. When you're down there, you probably don't get those decisions. But also, we've got to take our chances.
"Fon Williams is quite upset with the goal - he's been great for us so I can't be too hard on him, and he shouldn't even have played today, the way his back is.
"But our reaction from there, we could have easily folded, but we didn't, we took the game right to them, and we created so many chances, same we did against Dundee. How we didn't win today, I'll never know."
Hamilton Accies player-manager Martin Canning: "It seems to be the story of the season so far. I thought second-half they started on the front foot, they made it one-each, and from then I thought we were excellent.
"We created enough opportunities we should have made more of, and probably scored and won the game. But again, it's another point, another difficult place to come, and I think if we put a couple of wins in there, performance-wise, we're difficult to break down, difficult to beat, we'd be reasonably pleased.
"The fact we're missing two or three wins out of that group of draws, it means now it becomes vital we start picking up three points."
