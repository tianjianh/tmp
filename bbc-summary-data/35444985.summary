Cheryl James Deepcut inquest: Father to give evidence

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A second inquest into the death of a teenage army recruit at Deepcut Barracks more than 20 years ago is to hear evidence from her father.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Pte Cheryl James, 18, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in November 1995.
She was one of four soldiers who died at the Surrey barracks between 1995 and 2002 amid claims of bullying and abuse.
The inquest in Woking is expected to last seven weeks and hear evidence from more than 100 people.
In 2014, the High Court quashed the original 1995 inquest, which recorded an open verdict.
Her father Des James is due to be the first witness to give evidence before coroner Judge Brian Barker on Monday.
Mr James told BBC Radio Wales' Eye on Wales programme: "There's no wrong verdict for me in this.
"As long as the process is impeccable, as long as I can look back and say everything we could do, we've done, that's the important thing."
He said he would approach the hearing with an "open mind" and wanted questions about the events leading up to her death answered.
Last summer, the recruit's body was exhumed and a fresh post-mortem examination was carried out.
Metallic fragments were recovered which have been analysed by a ballistics expert.
The family had repeatedly called for her body to be exhumed to resolve a dispute over the ballistics evidence.
Pte James was one of four soldiers found dead at Deepcut, in Camberley, between 1995 and 2002.
Ptes Sean Benton, James Collinson and Geoff Gray also died from gunshot wounds.

This new inquest is the culmination of a battle by Cheryl James's parents, Doreen and Des, to find out about events on and before the November morning when their teenage daughter was found dead.
Together with the families of the other soldiers who died at Deepcut, Mr and Mrs James campaigned for a public inquiry. The families didn't succeed with that and so their lawyers began looking at the possibility of fresh inquests.
Cheryl James's parents who, like two of the other families, are represented by lawyers from the human rights organisation, Liberty, were the first to be granted a new inquest.
This was after Liberty had gained access to the material held by Surrey police: 44 volumes of statements, documents, notes and photographs. Now for the first time this will come under detailed scrutiny in a public forum.
