[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Leo McLoone will not be featuring for Donegal next season
The 27-year-old Naomh Conaill clubman confirmed his decision to the Donegal Democrat but did not wish to give a reason for opting out of the squad.
McLoone won the All-Ireland title with Donegal in 2012.
Once a regular starter, he made only three appearances from the bench for Donegal in the championship this year.
McLoone also took a break from the Donegal squad for the first half of the 2015 season.
