Brendan Rodgers insists there is "no leftover feeling" from Celtic's 7-0 loss in Barcelona as his side return their focus to domestic matters.

The defending Scottish Premiership champions and current leaders visit Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Sunday.
"It's important as coach and manager you intervene because if you leave it, it maybe can continue," said Rodgers.
"The first morning we were back in we were able to reflect on it and that's your lever to move on."
Celtic opened their Champions League group campaign at the Nou Camp having won four league games out of four, including last weekend's 5-1 defeat of Rangers.
However, Lionel Messi netted a hat-trick and Luis Suarez scored twice as Barca inflicted the third defeat of Rodgers' reign as Celtic boss with the other two losses coming during the club's Champions League qualifying campaign.
"For us there is no leftover feeling from the other night," said the former Liverpool boss.
"In the last couple of days it's just been about stabilising the emotion of the week really. The players have been absolutely outstanding since the day I walked in here and we've been given some harsh lessons in the Nou Camp the other night against arguably the world's best ever team.
"It was a difficult night for us and that 24 hours afterwards, it's disappointing and a very humbling experience when that happens to you.
"Make no mistake, they've made a real stride by qualifying for the Champions League because it's a real difficult process to come through and I think you look at the team we beat in the final qualification game, Hapoel Beer Sheva.
"They go to the San Siro and win 2-0 [against Inter Milan in the Europa League] so that tells you the level of task that you have over six games in order to qualify.
"So the players have done remarkably well with virtually the same group of players [as last season]. So my job is to manage the expectation within that and really make sure we improve going forward."
Celtic will again be without top scorer Leigh Griffiths in the Highlands on Sunday, the striker still recovering from injury.
And midfielder Stuart Armstrong said of Sunday's match: "A trip away to Inverness is a different sort of atmosphere than the last two games we played.
"We're ruthless in the league so far this season and we want to continue being so. It's vital we get the three points and everyone's willing for that to happen."
