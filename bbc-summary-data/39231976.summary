The 37-year-old ended his playing career last month after 735 senior appearances spread over 18 years.
He also played for Plymouth, Mansfield, Bristol Rovers, Crystal Palace, Leyton Orient, Bournemouth, AFC Wimbledon, and Gillingham.
As well as working with the first team, he will assist young players making the transition into the senior squad.
"He's got real drive and enthusiasm, which is key at an important part of the season for everyone," Millwall boss Neal Harris told the club website.
"Adam will be working at first team level but also with young players who are making the transition into the senior squad."
Meanwhile, Harris has been named League One Manager of the Month after the Lions, who face Tottenham in an FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday, went unbeaten during February.
