[SN]TITLE[SN]
Sutton United 2-0 Torquay United

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sutton United registered back-to-back wins as goals from Maxime Biamou and Nick Bailey secured them a 2-0 victory against 10-man Torquay.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Biamou struck in the fourth minute from close range after Torquay had failed to clear a corner and Bailey doubled their advantage when he converted a 55th-minute penalty.
Bailey coolly converted his spot-kick after Sutton forward Biamou had been brought down by Torquay defender Ben Gerring, who was sent off after receiving his second yellow card for the challenge.
Torquay were not without chances, with Nathan Blissett just inches high with his effort from Dan Sparkes' corner just before the break and Brett Williams just failing to latch on to Sparkes' early cross.
