Dortmund, missing top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang due to a family bereavement, fell behind to a 14th-minute tap-in from Alfred Finnbogason.
Henrikh Mkhitaryan poked the ball home to level at 1-1 just before the break.
Gonzalo Castro's deflected effort made it 2-1 before Adrian Ramos fired in at the second attempt in the 75th minute.
Bayern's 1-0 win at Cologne on Friday night had extended their advantage in the title race as they look to secure a fourth successive championship.
Dortmund, who last week knocked Tottenham out of the Europa League, struggled to respond with a poor first-half showing against an Augsburg side which had won just one of its previous nine league games as they battle to avoid the drop.
But once Mkhitaryan's deflected shot had beaten former Arsenal goalkeeper Alex Manninger, who was playing his first game of the season, they dominated the second half to secure their sixth win in seven league games.
