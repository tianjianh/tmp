The 26-year-old joined the Terriers from Dynamo Dresden in July 2016 and made 40 appearances in 2016-17.
Boss David Wagner said: "I think everyone can see how big an influence he is in the dressing room and how good of a character he is for the team."
The Terriers start their inaugural Premier League campaign at Crystal Palace on Saturday.
