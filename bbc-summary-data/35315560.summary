Langley Mill flat fire: Father threatened to 'body bag' people

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A father accused of murder after a baby and two teenagers died in a fire had threatened to "body bag" people during a row over a moped, a court has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Amy Smith, 17, six-month-old daughter Ruby-Grace Gaunt and friend Edward Green, also 17, died in the blaze at Langley Mill in Derbyshire last June.
Peter Eyre and his sons Simon, 24, and Anthony Eyre, 22, are alleged to have deliberately started the fire in an act of revenge.
All three deny three counts of murder.
Jurors previously heard Ruby-Grace's father, 18-year-old Shaun Gaunt, and another teenager who survived the fire were also inside the flat, but had escaped with the help of neighbours.
Nottingham Crown Court heard that prior to the fire, Mr Gaunt and a group of friends visited another of Peter Eyre's sons - Aaron Henshaw - after a friend told him he had stolen his Piaggio Zip moped, which went missing "in March or April".
Giving evidence, Mr Gaunt told the court he heard Peter Eyre on the phone to Mr Gaunt's friend during the row outside the defendants' home in Sandiacre, Derbyshire, when he said: "You need to sort this... out before I body bag the lot of you."
It is alleged Peter Eyre, 44, made the comments.
"I believe it was aimed at everyone," Mr Gaunt said.
A jury was told Mr Gaunt drank between 15 and 17 bottles of the tequila-flavoured beer Desperados, with Mr Gaunt saying he had been drinking "most of the day" before the fire.
Mr Gaunt and his friends continued to "drive around" in Mr Green's Peugeot 106 before going back to the defendants' house just before 01:30 GMT, because a friend was "adamant" Mr Gaunt's moped was there.
It is claimed by Mr Gaunt that after his friend demanded to know where the moped was, Peter Eyre came outside with a large lump hammer and said: "I'll show you".
Mr Gaunt said he responded by smashing a bottle of Desperados he was carrying "for protection".
Mr Gaunt then told the court as the group were driving off, he saw someone get into a black Skoda parked outside the Sandiacre house and begin to follow them.
The teenager said the car was driving just "a few feet" behind them, with the Peugeot itself travelling at "about 80mph" at the same time.
Shaun Smith QC, defending Peter Eyre, cross examined Mr Gaunt, and said any comment about body bags had not been made until Mr Gaunt and his friends had left the house.
The defence also disputed there was a car chase following the confrontation.
The trial continues.
