Head coach Alan Solomons had already committed himself until next May and welcomed the new deals.
"It will provide us with the stability and continuity which is needed to keep the club moving forward," he said.
"They are all good coaches and first class blokes, who have the interests of the club at heart. There is great synergy between us."
Edinburgh already have 24 players signed up for next season.
Forwards coach Scott, the former Scotland hooker, has been with the Pro12 club since summer 2013.
"I think the club's taken massive strides forward since I've been part of it, both as a player and a coach," he said.
"There's been a big emphasis on set piece and I see our scrum coming on really well.
"It was great to see our front row going into the Six Nations and performing well."
Backs coach Hodge, the former Scotland fly-half, switched to Edinburgh from the national backroom team last year.
"It's a massive thing for me to coach at my home side," he said.
"I've spent large parts of my life in Edinburgh and it's great to be able to influence what's going on at the club."
UK-born defence coach Wilkins joined Edinburgh in August after being in a similar position with Queensland Reds.
"I've enjoyed my first season here immensely," he said. "It's certainly a longer season than I was used to in the southern hemisphere.
"But that was part of the appeal - to be able to work through the ebbs and flows, to continue to improve and tweak the systems. I've really enjoyed that process."
