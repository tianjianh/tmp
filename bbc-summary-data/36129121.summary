The company is cutting more than 10,000 jobs across the world, with 2,800 of those connected with the BG deal.
Shell plans to close the Thames Valley Park campus by the end of the year.
All Aberdeen-based onshore operations will move to Tullos, with BG's offices at Albyn Place closing, as will Shell's Brabazon House office in Manchester.
Shell said the decisions were subject to the outcome of staff consultation.
The company is also planning to open a voluntary redundancy arrangement at Thames Valley Park.
Royal Dutch Shell shareholders approved the company's $49bn takeover of BG Group in January.
Of those who voted, 83.08% of shareholders were in favour of the deal, one of the largest in the energy sector in the past decade.
Shell announced last April that it had agreed to buy oil and gas exploration firm BG Group.
