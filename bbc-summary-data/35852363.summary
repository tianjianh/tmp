Dungannon midfielder Andrew Mitchell was sent-off for two yellows in the dying seconds but the win was secured and the Swifts moved up to seventh place in the Premiership.
Warrenpoint made a bright start at Warden Street and McMurray calmly slotted in the opener for the basement side.
The game turned on Moan's dismissal on 43 minutes after he handled from Johnny Taylor's header.
Jenkins saw his penalty saved by Jonathan Parr but he reacted quickly to net the rebound and equalise.
United squandered second-half chances while Warrenpoint remained a threat on the counter-attack.
Faulkner proved to be an inspired substitution by Jeffrey, who was in charge of the Sky Blues for the first time at the Showgrounds after he began his reign with a draw at Crusaders last weekend.
The substitute fired home in the final minute before sealing the points with a close-range finish in added time.
