Now Miranda Hart is making her West End theatre debut in the musical Annie.
The Call the Midwife star, who will play orphanage owner Miss Hannigan, described it as "a dream role" that she never thought would become a reality.
"But here we are and I have a newly found musical theatre-esque spring in my step," she said.
Set in 1930s New York during the Great Depression, Annie tells the story of an 11-year-old girl who wants to escape from a life of misery at Miss Hannigan's orphanage and find her parents.
The score includes the songs It's A Hard Knock Life, Tomorrow and Easy Street.
"I hope people will leave the theatre feeling life is a little better and dreamier and jollier after watching it, as much as we feel that performing it," added Hart, who broke the "fourth wall" by addressing the audience directly in her sitcom Miranda.
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have some leg-warmers to put on."
The show will begin previews at London's Piccadilly Theatre on 23 May. Further casting will be announced shortly.
