Anas Sarwar launches bid to become an MSP

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Scottish Labour's former deputy leader Anas Sarwar has announced he is launching a bid to become an MSP.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The ex-Glasgow Central MP said he would stand for a place on the Glasgow regional list for the 2016 Holyrood election.
Mr Sarwar was one of several prominent Labour MPs who lost their seats to the SNP in May's general election.
He said he still "cared passionately" about both Scotland and the Labour party.
Speaking on STV's Scotland Tonight programme, the 32-year-old said: "I genuinely believe the best vehicle of change for our country is still the Labour Party.
"I wanted to put myself forward to fight for my city, fight for Glasgow, but also fight for Labour values right across the UK."
Voters will go to the polls in May to elect 73 constituency MSPs with the first-past-the-post system and use their second vote to elect 56 regional list MSPs by an additional member system.
