The £150m casino and shopping complex Resorts World has opened, hoping to turn Birmingham into a global holiday destination.

The 12-storey, 538,000 sq ft (50,000 sq m) building is based on the shape of a cruise ship and houses 18 bars and restaurants, 50 outlet shops, a cinema, casino, spa and hotel.
Built on the NEC site, it sits next to the Genting Arena gig venue.
The resort is opening gradually, with shops trading from Wednesday.
An 11-screen Imax cinema opens on Friday, and the casino and night-time bars will open on Monday.
Birmingham or Bahamas: How does Resorts World compare?
Operations manager Barry Clemo claimed the resort will appeal to shoppers, concertgoers and casino players.
The resort is the first of its type in the UK, according to Mr Clemo, in that visitors will not have to leave the building.
He said it was aimed at people "too young to sit at home watching telly, and too old to push through the crowds in the city centre".
The resort, which will employ 1,200 staff, can accommodate about 12,000 people at any one time.
