Kenneth Edward Usher, 77, was riding his trike in the Lincolnshire village of Whaplode Drove when he was in a crash with a Suzuki Wagon.
Mr Usher, from Crowland, had been a member of cycling clubs which met in areas including Spalding, Peterborough, Cambridge and Icknield.
Police are appealing for witnesses to the crash which happened on 3 February.
In a statement Mr Usher's family said: "It is with the greatest sadness that our father and husband was tragically killed on his trike in an accident.
"Cycling was his life and in his 77 years he held a few good records, including the Mersey 24-Hour.
"He died doing what he loved best and is sorely missed by wife, Gladys, son, Paul, and daughter, Jayne.
"We would like to thank everyone for their support and comfort at this sad time."
Mr Usher's family said he started in the Crouch Hill Cycling Club and joined many others, including the Witham Wheelers and BEC Cycling Club.
He died at the scene of the crash, which happened in Broadgate shortly before 13:00 GMT.
The driver of the car, an 80-year-old Spalding man, was uninjured.
