Two PSNI officers disciplined after boy suffers injuries

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two PSNI officers have been disciplined after the Police Ombudsman found failings in the way police investigated an incident which left a teenager fighting for his life.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The boy severed an artery on a plate glass window in County Antrim in 2011, suffering life changing injuries.
His mother complained to the Ombudsman's office several years later.
She alleged police had failed to properly investigate if her son had been deliberately pushed.
An initial 999 call made by one of five friends, who were with the teenager at the time, indicated that he had been pushed through the window. However a second 999 call, made several minutes later, reported that he had kicked it.
The teenager's mother told the Ombudsman that the police investigation had been closed down after two week, despite her being told that her son had denied kicking the window and had a memory of being pushed.
She also alleged that police had failed to ensure her son's phone was properly examined, and that officers may have missed evidence.
When interviewed, the investigating police officer accepted that the case had been quickly suspended pending new evidence. However, he said he had done so only after making a series, after which he was satisfied no further investigation was needed.
The officer also told the Ombudsman's investigation that the only indication the teenager had been pushed was the initial 999 call. He added that the friend who made the call had explained that the injured boy did not want to get into trouble for kicking the window and had asked him to say he was pushed.
However the Police Ombudsman's investigation found a number of issues with how the officer dealt with the case.
It said there was a "limited examination of text messages" exchanged between the boys who had been at the scene.
The investigation also found that photographs of the scene were lost and that there was no forensic examination of the window to establish whether the damage caused was consistent with the boy having been pushed through it,.
The officer's supervisor was also found to have not properly supervised the investigation.
The Ombudsman found no evidence that the police investigation had been compromised as a result of links between police officers and the families of two of the boys who had been at the scene.
The PSNI has since implemented the Ombudsman's recommendation that the investigating officer and his supervisor should both be disciplined for their handling of the case.
