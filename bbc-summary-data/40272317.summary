Hundreds of pelicans there have been seriously poorly due to a poisonous algae that has been growing far too quickly in the waters where they live.
While small amounts of this algae are fine, the pelicans have big appetites and too much of the green stuff makes them so ill they can't swim or fly.
So wildlife reserves are nursing them back to health and then setting them free when their tummies are better.
Check this out.
