Detectives investigating the murder of former senior IRA man Gerard 'Jock' Davison in Belfast are taking part in the BBC Crimewatch programme in a renewed appeal for information.

The 47-year-old was shot a number of times at Welsh Street in the Markets area at 09:09 BST on Tuesday 5 May.
The gunman made off on foot.
Police have said they hope the opportunity provided by Crimewatch will "generate calls from people who can help us apprehend the killer".
Detective Superintendent Kevin Geddes, from the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch, said the investigation was progressing but they needed more information.
Police have said they do not believe dissident republicans were behind the attack, and do not believe Mr Davison's murder was sectarian.
So far, three people have been arrested over the murder, but all of them have been released without charge.
It is understood Mr Davison was involved in the fight in a Belfast bar in January 2005 that led to the death of Robert McCartney. It was one of Northern Ireland's most high profile killings.
Mr Davison's uncle, Terence, was later acquitted of Mr McCartney's murder.
Crimewatch will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Tuesday at 21:00 BST.
