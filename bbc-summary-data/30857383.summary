Police said the group took delivery of packages of the drug sent from Pakistan totalling 5kg, between April 2013 and April last year.
The boxes were filled with clothes and restaurant menus to conceal the heroin.
All earlier admitted a variety of drug importation, supply and possession offences at Manchester Crown Court.
Lesley Anne Ball, 23, of Higher House Close, Oldham, was ordered to complete 200 hours of unpaid work for allowing her house to be used in the supply of Class A drugs.
Det Con Gary Lamont said the gang had packages delivered to an array of addresses in Oldham and Burnley and used various aliases and couriers.
He said: "It was a sophisticated and complex importation case and these sentences are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our officers on the ground."
