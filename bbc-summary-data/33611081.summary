She was giving evidence to the Lords' communications committee on the future of the BBC.
Now a BBC 6 Music presenter, she said she left in 2007 because she wanted her children to have access to advert-free public service broadcasting.
She said the BBC was a "true window on the world".
The House of Lords communications committee is looking at what the public purposes of the BBC should be and who should set the level of the licence fee.
Matthews, the former lead singer of Catatonia, was giving evidence alongside the chairman of the Arts Council for England, Sir Peter Bazalgette.
She said you needed to spend time in Australia, where people are "very envious of BBC" and the United States, where she lived for six years, to appreciate the broadcaster.
"It was during those years that I truly felt the true value and extent of what the BBC gives us culturally," she said.
"This disparity between the rich and poor and black and whites in America is shocking and I truly believe it's because they lack a well-funded and easily accessible public broadcasting provider that these disparities exist."
She said American TV bombarded you with adverts and she decided to come back to Britain in 2007 "because she missed the BBC so much" and wanted her children to have access to advert-free broadcasting and a "true window on the world".
"It's allowed to take the risks that the commercial sector can't take. The BBC has a completely different agenda, it's there to provide high quality entertainment and unbiased and informative programmes for everyone in the UK, whatever their interests."
Matthews also spoke about how her own band's growth was helped by BBC radio.
The UK government has launched a green paper on the future of the BBC, ahead of the renewal of its royal charter in 2017.
