The Australian defeated 11-time world champion Kelly Slater, but fell out of the semi-finals to Brazilian Adriano de Souza, who claimed his first WSL crown.
Mr de Souza paid tribute to Fanning saying "he deserved it more than me".
There has been strong support after a grieving Fanning won his Pipeline quarter-finals heat on Wednesday.
The Australian broke down in an interview after his winning heat, not long after learning of his brother's death.
He later posted on social media that it was one of the most challenging days of his life.
"I am so grateful for the incredible love and well wishes that have come my way since learning of my eldest brother's passing," Fanning said on Instagram.
"Like all my big brothers, Peter will always be a hero to me... I knew I could find the strength to take part in the final event of the season because that's what Pete would want."
It has not been disclosed how or where Peter Fanning died.
Mick Fanning came close to losing his own life in July after being forced to fight off a shark during a competition in South Africa.
Mick's mother, who is currently with him in Hawaii, said she was overwhelmed by the live televised footage of his close encounter with the shark.
"I just saw my boy going down. That was absolutely terrifying because I have lost a son before," Liz Osborne told Fairfax media.
Fanning's other brother, Sean, died in a car accident in 1998.
Immediately after clinching the Pipeline Masters title, Adriano de Souza spoke of conflicting emotions going into the final day of competition.
"I wish so much to give a hug to Mick's mum, but it's kind of scary as we are in a world title race and I didn't want to mix it up," de Souza said.
"I think Mick deserved it more than me, he's such a strong man, a three-time world champion. The strongest man I have met in my whole life."
