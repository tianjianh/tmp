[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Scott Diver, 16, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, was last seen at his home on Saturday 17 September.
The teenager, who is 5ft 7in tall, with a slim build, dark hair and blue eyes, is said to need regular medication.
The CCTV images show Scott walking in Clydebank's Dalmuir Park, towards the Mountblow Road entrance, at about 14:53 on the day he went missing.
Insp John Mullen said: "The two images we are issuing today have been identified as Scott - this is the last confirmed known sighting of him.
"As the weather was favourable that day, there were a number of people within the park who may have seen Scott.
"I would urgently ask anyone who remembers being in the park and who might have seen Scott to get in touch with us. Even if you don't believe you may have seen Scott in the park please contact the police as you may have information that is pertinent to our inquiry."
Insp Mullen said that given the length of time Scott had been missing police and his family "remain concerned for his welfare".
He added: "His family and friends are very distressed at his disappearance. He is a young boy who is vulnerable and needs to be home with his family."
Insp John Mullen said that anyone with information could contact police at a dedicated email address: scottdiverinquiry@scotland.pnn.police.uk
