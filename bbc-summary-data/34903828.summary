The violence increased in recent weeks, with bodies found on the streets on a daily basis.

The White House said it had received "multiple, credible, and ongoing reports of targeted killings, arbitrary arrests, torture, and political repression by security forces, as well as violence and abuses by youth militia affiliated with the ruling party".
"Recent dangerous rhetoric by government officials has further contributed to the climate of fear and risks inciting further violence," the statement added.
"At the same time, some of those opposed to the Nkurunziza government have resorted to violence against the government."
Earlier this month, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the escalating violence.
The French-drafted resolution also paves the way for a possible deployment of blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers.
Burundi's constitutional court backed Mr Nkurunziza's third-term bid, as his first term as president did not count towards the constitutional two-term limit because he was chosen by MPs, rather than in a popular election.
Mr Nkurunziza was duly re-elected with 70% of the vote in July.
