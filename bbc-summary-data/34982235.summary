Kyren Wilson says only reaching the third round of the UK Championship is "not good enough".

The world number 22, who won his first ranking event at the Shanghai Masters in September, was beaten 6-1 by world number 52 Tom Ford.
"It's not me being pig-headed, I am a very determined young man and I want to be winning tournaments," he said.
"I beat two very good players to start with but I wanted to kick on. The last 32 is not really good enough any more."
Kettering's Wilson, 23, beat Paul Davison and Mike Dunn to secure his place in the last 62, but he trailed Leicester's Ford 3-0 before getting on the board with a fine break of 84.
However, Ford won the next three to earn a convincing win.
"I missed a silly ball in the first frame and let Tom settle very early," Wilson told BBC Sport.
"You have to put players like him under pressure.
"He is a fluent, attacking player and if you don't put him under pressure he can get in to his stride.
"We both had a bit of good fortune in places, but Tom seemed to have some good fortune at what seemed to be crucial times. But I can't take anything away from him.
"I felt I was in first in pretty much every frame but it was one of those games where things just kept landing awkwardly and I had to play safe. But Tom played great so good luck to him."
