The Whites are challenging for the Championship play-offs after finishing 20th last season under the Serb, who took charge in December 2015.
Jokanovic, 48, signed a new contract until 2019 on 23 February.
"The manager and the staff have got to take a lot of credit. He has stabilised the club and transformed the way we play," Cairney, 26, told BBC London.
"The fans are enjoying our style of football and the club have given him a new contract, which is great to see."
Fulham are seventh in the table, five points behind Sheffield Wednesday and with a game in hand on the Owls.
The west London club are looking to return to the Premier League for the first time since their relegation from the top flight in 2014.
"The play-offs are definitely within our grasp," midfielder Cairney added.
"I think we've got enough ability in the squad, and the right staff in place, to creep into the top six.
"It could go down to the wire as we play Sheffield Wednesday away in our last game of the season. If it does, it will be an amazing game to be involved in."
Cairney's form this season has been crucial to Fulham's play-off bid, with the former Hull and Blackburn man scoring seven goals and making nine assists in 32 league appearances.
His form has seen him nominated for the English Football League Player of the Year prize at the London Football Awards, alongside team-mate Sone Aluko.
"It is a massive achievement," Cairney said. "To be nominated on the shortlist is fantastic. I am really proud, as are my family.
"I really enjoy playing with Sone. If one of us win it it will be great for Fulham - but hopefully it will be me."
