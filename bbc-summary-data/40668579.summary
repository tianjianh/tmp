Regal rules: The dos and don'ts for meeting the Queen

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Canada's governor general has been forced to defend his actions after a "slippy" carpet led to a breach of royal etiquette with the Queen. But how do you avoid a protocol slip-up?

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
David Johnston raised eyebrows on Wednesday as he was seen to be lightly touching Her Majesty's elbow as she descended some steps, at an event in London.
Mr Johnston said he was simply concerned about the Queen's safety and made the judgement that a breach of protocol was appropriate "to be sure that there was no stumble".
To avoid any future mishaps, however, here is a reminder of the traditional dos and don'ts.
These rules aren't steadfast and those in breach need not fear exile. The official website for the British Monarchy states "there are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting the Queen or a member of the Royal Family".  It hastens to add: "Many people wish to observe the traditional forms." The choice is yours.
