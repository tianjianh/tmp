An "external platform" at Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) in Banbury caught fire at about 23:50 BST on Saturday.
Fire crews from Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire brought it under control overnight and there were no injuries to staff.
The cause is currently unknown and an investigation is under way.
Police cordons were put in place along Ruscote Avenue, with a large road closure in place between Tesco Extra and The Musketeer pub. They were removed at 01:45.
A JDE spokesman said: "The onsite team made a decision to proactively evacuate the relevant section of the site in accordance with strict safety procedures.
"The production process on site was shut down but is being restarted following the action and guidance of the fire service and the onsite JDE incident management team.
"JDE would like to thank the local fire service for their fast actions and for how they worked closely with our incident team to minimise the fire and disruption to the site."
Incident commander Simon Sumners, from Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue, said: "Crews quickly got firefighting jets on to the fire, and working closely with the site engineers the fire damage to the building was limited."
A Thames Valley Police spokeswoman said: "We received a report from the fire service that a factory in Ruscote Avenue, Banbury, was on fire.
"Officers attended the scene to assist the fire service with road closures... the fire service will carry out the initial investigation then advise police if arson is suspected or not."
