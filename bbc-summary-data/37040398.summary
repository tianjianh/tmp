It broke out at Good Shepherd Primary and Nursery School on Dungiven Road just before 20:00 BST on Wednesday evening.
The fire is understood to have started in a wooden equipment shed at the school and spread to the roof.
The blaze is being treated as deliberate at this stage.
Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) Group Commander Colm McGuigan said up to five appliances dealt with the incident.
"We're very lucky that this fire was discovered in the early stages, had this damage not been discovered very early, a lot of damage would have been done to the school," he said.
Sinn FÃ©in councillor Christopher Jackson visited the scene.
"It's very worrying that this fire has taken place just a few weeks before the new school term starts," he said.
"I would appeal to anyone in the community who has any information on how this fire started  to bring it forward to the investigations team."
