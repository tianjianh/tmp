Motherwell have released Louis Laing after the defender spent the first half of the season on loan to Notts County.

The 23-year-old played 27 times for the English League Two outfit, but his contract with the Scottish Premiership club has ended by mutual consent.
Laing had joined Well from Nottingham Forest, initially on loan, in January 2015 and made 31 appearances.
He had previously had a loan spell with County, playing 12 times for the Magpies.
Transfer deadline day passed without any major changes to Mark McGhee's Motherwell squad.
They failed in an attempt to sign Turkish striker Nadir Ciftci from Celtic on loan.
That could have allowed Well to accept an approach A-League club Western Sydney Wanderers for Scott McDonald.
But the Australian will remain at Fir Park until at least the end of the season.
Motherwell did make two additions to their squad on deadline day, with midfielder Shea Gordon joining from Sheffield United and goalkeeper Oliver Pain on loan from Sunderland.
The 18-year-old Gordon, who has captained Northern Ireland youths, and 19-year-old Pain will initially join Motherwell's development squad.
Australian-born Pain signed for Sunderland in September after leaving Crystal Palace and is a replacement for Well under-20s goalkeeper PJ Morrison, who needs an operation following a wrist injury.
In addition, Well midfielder Tom Fry has joined League Two outfit Annan Athletic on loan, while defender and fellow 19-year-old Luke Watt has joined East Fife after the end of a similar loan move to League One rivals Stranraer.
