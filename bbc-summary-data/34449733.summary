India v South Africa T20 match stopped twice after crowd trouble

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
India's Twenty20 match against South Africa in Cuttack had to be stopped twice because of crowd trouble.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Fans threw bottles onto the field after the home side were all out for 92 in game two of a three-match series.
The match was halted for periods of 20 and 25 minutes during the South Africa reply, and English match referee Chris Broad ordered organisers to improve security before it could resume.
The touring side reached their victory target in 17.1 overs.
Seamer Albie Morkel was the pick of the South Africa bowlers, taking 3-12 as only four India players reached double figures.
In reply, JP Duminy hit 30 not out as South Africa reached 96-4 to take an unassailable 2-0 lead.
