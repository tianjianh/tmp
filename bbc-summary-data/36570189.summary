A family fund set up by friends passed its Â£2,000 target within hours of confirmation of her death.
The 30-year-old had disappeared last Sunday after leaving a social event for deaf people in Glasgow city centre.
Police are not treating her death as suspicious.
Friends of Kirsty launched an online fundraising drive, asking for contributions towards her funeral service costs and "supporting Kirsty's children future".
By Sunday evening, more than Â£7,000 had been raised.
The JustGiving page reads: "We have lost a beautiful lady - Kirsty Aitchison. A lovely mum to four beautiful children. She was only 30 years old.
"Kirsty was a fantastic mum to her four children, they were her world. She always had something positive and funny to say about her children. They will be truly devastated.
"Kirsty is well known and loved by her many friends and family members. It's kinda like one of our own who has been taken away from us.
"Our heart breaks for her family and most importantly her four children. They've lost a daughter, sister, cousin, mum, a best friend and someone they could have fun with.
"Kirsty's death is a great shock, it was unexpected.
"She always had a smile on her face and she will be solely missed by everyone. She was young so no provision had been made for a funeral at this time in her life. Any contributions will help greatly.
Condolences have been pouring in to Kirsty's family via social media.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was among many who expressed their sorrow.
She wrote on Twitter: "A sad end to a very sad week. My deepest condolences to Kirsty Aitchison's family and friends."
One Facebook user wrote: "God bless kirsty, may you fly free angel, love and condolences to your family, may they find peace in time x."
Another said: "So sorry to hear the tragic news of such a beautiful girl. i cannot begin to think how ur family r feeling. Rip Angel."
Kirsty's body was recovered by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service near to the Kingston Bridge on Saturday afternoon, close to where she went missing.
After leaving the Campus bar in Sauchiehall Street at about 03:00 last Sunday, Kirsty was seen on CCTV images heading towards the Broomielaw, holding her high-heeled black sandals and walking barefoot.
It had been reported she may have been planning to meet friends at a casino moored on the river.
During the week, police divers were brought in to search the river, and an air support unit was used to assist community policing officers as they conducted inquiries.
