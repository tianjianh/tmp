The Northern Premier League Division One North outfit had reached the second round after a shock 1-0 win over League Two Exeter City.
They fell behind to an early goal from Matty Pattison, the forward sweeping home Rob Ramshaw's cutback.
Pattison and Danny Wright both hit the woodwork before Wright sealed victory in the last minute.
The substitute capitalised on an error from Yellows goalkeeper Karl Wills to put the ball into an empty net.
Lee Gaskell's acrobatic volley that went just wide was as close as the visitors came.
