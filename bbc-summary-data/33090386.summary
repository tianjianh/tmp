Thousands of drivers fined for using a street in York at restricted times should get their money back, the council leader has said.

The authority lost an appeal in April over issuing fixed penalty notices to drivers using Coppergate.
The Traffic Penalty Tribunal said errors in the signage meant the restrictions were not enforceable.
Conservative leader Chris Steward said a formal decision would be be made in July.
"We will be looking at the executive to approve a process to refund the fines and draw a line under the whole debacle," he said.
Mr Steward took control of the authority in coalition with the Liberal Democrats following elections in May.
The previous Labour administration had installed an automatic number plate recognition system on Coppergate in August 2013.
It came as a trial closure of Lendal Bridge began, which was also ruled to be unenforcable.
The schemes were both abandoned in April 2014 and the council has already refunded thousands of drivers for driving over Lendal Bridge.
About 13,000 motorists were issued automatic fines for driving on Coppergate during the scheme.
The council said the revenue from fines - about Â£350,000 - had been ring-fenced in the budget in case refunds had to be made.
