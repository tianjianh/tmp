Wales and British and Irish Lions flanker Justin Tipuric will miss Ospreys' Pro12 trip to Zebre on Friday as he recovers from concussion.

Tipuric came off as unbeaten Ospreys won 19-14 at Munster on Saturday.
Ospreys pack coach Chris Gibbes said: "He's probably going to miss this week. There are no after-effects in terms of his concussion or his head knock."
The Welsh Rugby Union guidelines on concussion state Tipuric could return six days after his blow.
Fellow Wales cap James King replaced 25-year-old Tipuric on Saturday, who has won 24 caps for the national side.
The WRU has joined a global International Rugby Board drive to improve care for concussed players.
If Tipuric was involved at lower levels of the game, the WRU guidance is not to return to play for at least two weeks.
But the specialist care available to professional players means they can make more rapid returns to the field of play.
The WRU recently launched a "zero tolerance" initiative aimed at educating players and coaches about the potential dangers of concussion and brain injuries.
