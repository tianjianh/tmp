[SN]TITLE[SN]
Belfast brothers guilty of attempted murder

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Two brothers have been found guilty of attempted murder after a man was stabbed in Belfast over four years ago.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Joseph Henry was hit over the head with a crowbar and stabbed in the neck and remained in hospital for 25 days after the attack at a house in Eliza Terrace.
Hugh McCormick, 50, from Rosevale Street and his 46-year old brother James McCormick, from Teeling Avenue in Dunmurry, were found guilty of attempting to murder Mr Henry on 2 July 2011.
The brothers will be sentenced next month, and despite a request that they be released on continuing bail, they were both remanded in custody.
During the week-long trial, Mr Henry, whose sister has four children with James McCormick, said he was attacked by the brothers outside his home in the Markets area of south Belfast.
He told the jury he went out for a cigarette at around 8am, when he heard a voice from behind asking the whereabouts of his nephew.
Mr Henry said: "I turned round to see who the voice was, and it was Hugh McCormick. I knew him all my life as he has lived in the same area as me."
Skin splitting
Mr Henry said a bar was "protruding from the top'' of Mr McCormick's jacket and he "hit me on the top right hand side of my head and to my back".
Mr Henry said he then saw James McCormick coming out of his front door.
When asked how he knew him, Mr Henry said that he had gone to secondary school with him and had once been married to his sister.
Mr Henry said: "He had his right hand in his pocket the whole time. Then he pulled out a long steel butcher's knife, about 12 inches long in his right hand.
"He never said a word to me. Then he stuck the knife in my neck and ripped it up the side. I heard my skin actually splitting open.
"He then retrieved the knife from my neck and I heard Mr McCormick say: 'That's enough. Come on'.
"They went in through the front door of my house and then out the back door."
Eyewitness account
Mr Henry said that following the attack, he went back into the house and told his elderly mother: "I have been stabbed, phone an ambulance.'
He added: "I had my hand over my throat so she couldn't see my wounds."
Several of Mr Henry's relatives, including his mother and several sisters, gave evidence and said they thought he was going to die.
The brothers both denied any involvement in the attack, and during the trial, legal teams for both men spoke of a series of inconsistencies given by the Henry family in the aftermath of the attack - including one which appeared in a local newspaper.
Other issues the defence teams raised with the jury was an eyewitness account given by a man who was walking past the area, who saw the assault and who gave assistance to Mr Henry at the scene.
This independent eyewitness account included descriptions of both men, one of whom he said was around six feet tall. This, the defence legal teams pointed out, didn't match the height of either James or Hugh McCormick.
The jury were, however, reminded that Mr Henry was in the best position to identify the men who attacked him, and these were two men he had known all his life.
