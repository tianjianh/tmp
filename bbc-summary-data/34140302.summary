Rugby World Cup 2015: Williams, Jones & Lee 'fit for Wales duty'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Wales coach Warren Gatland says lock Alun Wyn Jones, Liam Williams and Samson Lee are expected to be fit for World Cup duty.

Full-back Williams and tight-head prop Lee have not played in Wales' warm-ups.
Lock Jones injured a knee while leading Wales to a 16-10 win over Ireland last weekend.
Gatland said that is a "one-week" issue so Jones could face Uruguay in Wales' World Cup opener on Sunday 20 September in Cardiff.
Williams underwent foot surgery in the off-season while fellow Scarlet Samson Lee has not played since rupturing ankle ligaments against Ireland in the 2015 Six Nations.
Gatland said: "They're all goodâ€¦ at the moment it's the fittest that we've been so Liam Williams is taking a full part in training next week, so he's there.
"I made a comment this morning - Samson Lee's full-out scrummaging in training so that's a huge positive so he's going to be fit and available, which is great.
"Alun Wyn's fresh and ready to go so it was sort of a one-week injury, but he's basically fit now."
Gatland also said tight-head prop Aaron Jarvis will cover the two hookers in the squad - Ken Owens and Scott Baldwin - if one is injured.
Tournament rules mean a player called into a squad because of injury cannot take the field within 48 hours of his arrival.
Gatland admits having only two specialist hookers is "a risk you take".
But he says title-holders New Zealand have done likewise by selecting only three recognised locks.
And Australia have also named only two specialist hookers in a pool that also includes Wales, Fiji, Uruguay and hosts England.
Cardiff Blues hooker Kristian Dacey was discarded from the Wales squad.
But he is on the bench as Sam Warburton returns from a shoulder blow to lead Wales in their final World Cup warm-up against Italy in Cardiff on Saturday.
Locks Jake Ball, Dominic Day, back-rower James King and centre Cory Allen also return against the Azzurri.
