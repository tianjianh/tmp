Oldham Athletic should be able to exit their transfer embargo within a week, says manager Stephen Robinson.

The League One side have been under the embargo since November because of a Â£300,000 bill with HM Revenue & Customs and fees owed to other clubs.
The Latics are bottom of the table, three points from safety, and are the lowest scorers in the Football League.
"As far as I'm led to believe it should be cleared at the latest next week," Robinson told BBC Radio Manchester.
"There is money coming in from the league so hopefully we can clear that and we can try and crack on with things."
Oldham have not won a league game since 18 October in what is Robinson's first season in charge after arriving last summer.
"We've got plans," the 42-year-old added. "We've had plans since November or December time and we've spoken to a lot of players
"Obviously it is not an ideal situation as we've not been able to press the button on things. When we get the green light to go and sign people we'll see if they're still available."
