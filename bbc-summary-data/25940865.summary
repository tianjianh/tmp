Lancashire Fusiliers Gallipoli Victoria Cross sought by museum

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A museum's search for the last of six Victoria Crosses "won before breakfast" by the Lancashire Fusiliers in the WW1 Gallipoli landings has begun.

The Fusilier Museum in Bury, Greater Manchester, wants to show the medals in 2015 on the centenary of the landings.
It owns two and has been loaned three, but the remaining VC, won by a major from East Sussex, was last heard of at auction in the 1980s.
Col Brian Gorski said finding it would be the "last piece of the puzzle".
He added that the hope was to "re-unite" the VC, won by Maj Cuthbert Bromley, with the other five medals "so we can tell their story to this generation".
The major, who had been temporarily promoted from captain, received Britain's highest award for bravery along with Cpl John Grimshaw, Pte William Keneally, Sgt Alfred Richards, Sgt Frank Stubbs and Capt Richard Willis in recognition for their actions when the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers landed at Gallipoli in Turkey on the morning of 25 April 1915.
The battalion lost more than half of its men as they landed on W Beach, which was later renamed Lancashire Landing.
Sarah Stevenson, collections officer at the museum, said the major's family was from Seaford in East Sussex, where he has been honoured in the local church, St Leonard's, and had a road named after him.
She said there had been no trace of the medal since the late 1980s, but that "someone must still be in possession of the missing medal".
"Our mission is to find it so it can take its place alongside the other VCs in the exhibition."
Lord Ashcroft, who has loaned three VCs to the museum for the exhibition, said the "'Six before Breakfast' comprise one of the most celebrated batches of gallantry medals from any action of the entire Great War".
In total, 18 men from the Lancashire regiment were awarded the VC for their actions during World War One.
