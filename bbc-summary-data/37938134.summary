[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Edinburgh prop Allan Dell will make his Scotland debut in Saturday's opening autumn international against Australia at Murrayfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Club-mate Ross Ford will win his 100th cap at hooker, while Glasgow's Zander Fagerson - on his second international appearance - completes the front row.
Stormers centre Huw Jones also wins his second cap.
Will Genia replaces Nick Phipps at scrum-half in Australia's only change from Saturday's 32-8 win over Wales.
Dean Mumm, Will Skelton and Tom Robertson take up places on the bench with Phipps, while James Slipper, Scott Fardy, Nick Frisby and Sefa Naivalu drop out of the squad.
Only full-back Stuart Hogg, second-row brothers Jonny and Richie Gray and back-row forwards John Barclay and Ryan Wilson featured in Scotland's most recent starting line-up, June's 21-16 win over Japan.
Ford, 32, becomes only the third Scotland player after Chris Paterson and Sean Lamont to reach 100 caps, while South Africa-born 24-year-old Dell qualifies for Scotland through grandparentage.
Saracens wing Maitland switches from left to right to accommodate Harlequins' Tim Visser, with Jones and Glasgow's Alex Dunbar taking over at centre from Matt Scott and Peter Horne, the latter on the bench. Wing Tommy Seymour is not involved, having started in Japan.
Captain Greig Laidlaw and fly-half Finn Russell replace Henry Pyrgos and Ruaridh Jackson in the half-back roles, Russell returning to the side after a serious head injury sustained on club duty this year.
Moray Low drops to the bench, while his front-row partners in Japan, Rory Sutherland and Stuart McInally, are not in the squad.
Scarlet's Barclay moves from open-side to blindside flanker in Josh Strauss' absence and Edinburgh's Watson comes in at seven and Warriors' Wilson remains at eight.
Uncapped Glasgow scrum-half Ali Price could make his debut off the bench.
After Saturday's Test, Scotland host Argentina at the same venue on 19 November and Georgia at Kilmarnock FC's Rugby Park on 26 November.
The Wallabies travel to face France on 19 November, Ireland on 26 November and England on 3 December.
