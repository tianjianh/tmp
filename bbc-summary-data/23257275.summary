Plans have been unveiled for a statue of Sir Isaac Brock to be placed outside Guernsey's St Peter Port markets.

The Brock Memorial Foundation submitted the plans to the Environment Department earlier this week and anticipates a decision by September.
A maquette of the statue has been produced by Canadian artist Adrienne Alison, who has told the BBC the statue should be ready by the autumn of 2014.
The statue is intended to mark the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812.
The conflict, in which Canada repelled US attempts at invasion, ended in February 1815.
Guernsey-born Brock died early in the war - during the Battle of Queenston Heights in 1812 - but became known as the Saviour of Upper Canada, having readied Canadian troops for the prospect of invasion.
Distant relative Oliver Brock, who is leading the statue project, said Â£50,000 remained to be found in order to pay for it, after sponsorship was secured from RBC Wealth Management.
Images of the proposed 7ft 6in (2.3m) statue were displayed on the market terrace on Tuesday.
There will be further public displays on Saturday and on 10, 17 and 24 August.
Mr Brock said he wanted feedback from islanders on the orientation of the statue.
It could be placed facing the Town Church Square below, facing the public space to the north or facing west towards Canada.
An online poll has been set up to establish the most popular option.
