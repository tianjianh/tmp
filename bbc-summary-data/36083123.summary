Mackie, who will miss the rest of the campaign, suffered a second long-term hamstring injury this season during the draw at Leeds earlier this month.
He was previously sidelined for more than three months, and has started just six league matches since returning to Rangers last summer for a second spell at the west London club.
The 30-year-old was due to undergo an operation on Tuesday.
Mackie became a fans' favourite during a three-year spell at Loftus Road, during which he played a key role in QPR's promotion to the Premier League in 2011.
He was sold to Nottingham Forest in 2013 and spent last season on loan at Reading, helping them reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup.
