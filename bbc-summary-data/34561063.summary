While Wales ended their 57-year wait to qualify for a major tournament, the Netherlands failed to reach the Euro 2016 finals in France next summer.
BBC Wales will broadcast the match live on television, radio and online.
Wales lost 2-0 when they last faced the Netherlands in a friendly in Amsterdam prior to the 2014 World Cup.
"We produced an excellent display when we last met the Netherlands," Wales manager Chris Coleman said.
"We look forward to welcoming the Dutch to Cardiff for what I'm sure will prove to be a valuable and entertaining match as we begin preparations for Euro 2016 in France."
