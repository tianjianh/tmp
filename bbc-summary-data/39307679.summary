Prime Minister Theresa May indicated this week that she would not allow a new Scottish independence vote before spring 2019.
Now Ms Sturgeon has offered to discuss with Mrs May what date might be suitable.
She told the BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith: "We have got a disagreement. What I am saying today is let us try and work our way through that disagreement."
