Workers are being recruited on temporary contracts to work over the busy Christmas period.
The internet company is hiring more than 15,000 extra people across the UK in the run-up to December.
Amazon said it expected "many hundreds" of the seasonal workers to move into permanent posts as a result.
The Swansea base, which opened in 2008, has more than 1,000 permanent staff.
During its busiest day last year, Amazon said customers ordered a total of 3.5m items in 24 hours - a rate, it said, of 44 per second.
In 2012, Amazon created more than 10,000 seasonal jobs in the run up to Christmas across the UK, including 1,000 in Swansea.
