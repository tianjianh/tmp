The 18-year-old starred at the 2015 Under-17 World Cup, helping Nigeria to win a record fifth title.
"I'm excited to have the opportunity to prove myself at a top club," Okonkwo told BBC Sport.
He is the third player from the 2015 Nigeria U17 side to join European clubs after Victor Osimhen went to Wolfsburg and Kelechi Nwakali joined Arsenal.
