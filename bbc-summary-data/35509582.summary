[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Ajose slotted in from Nathan Thompson's pass to put the Robins ahead, before placing the ball beyond Elliot Parish to double the lead after the break.
Doughty powered in Swindon's third from outside the box, but Joe Edwards' half-volley gave the hosts hope.
Town sealed the points shortly after as Bradley Barry found Doughty, who turned and fired home his second goal.
The result means Colchester are eight points adrift of safety at the bottom of League One, having failed to win in 16 league games.
