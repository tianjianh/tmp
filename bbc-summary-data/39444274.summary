Surrey have re-signed Australia all-rounder Moises Henriques for part of this season's T20 Blast competition.

He will provide cover while Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara is away at the Caribbean Premier League.
Henriques joined Surrey for the 2015 T20 Blast, but played only three times because of a fractured jaw suffered in a collision with team-mate Rory Burns.
The 30-year-old seam bowler has played in nine T20 internationals, scoring 89 runs at 22.25 and taking four wickets.
"It's great to have Moises back at Surrey after his injury in 2015," director of cricket Alec Stewart said.
"As well as being a quality individual, he has great T20 experience from all around the world and will add plenty of balance to our side."
Henriques' compatriot Aaron Finch will be with Surrey for the entire T20 competition, and earlier this month the county also re-signed former England batsman Kevin Pietersen.
