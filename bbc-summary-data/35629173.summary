The midfielder, 26, was dismissed when he clipped defender Adam Henley, who was looking to race clear at goal.
"Yes, we will appeal Kouyate's red card, which we believe was a mistake by the referee," Hammers co-chairman David Gold wrote on Twitter on Monday.
"The Blackburn player wasn't going to get the ball anyway so he wasn't denied a goalscoring opportunity."
West Ham have been drawn away in the quarter-finals to the winners of Monday's match between Shrewsbury Town and Manchester United.
