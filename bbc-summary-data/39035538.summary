[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gateshead's six-game National League winning run was brought to an end as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Macclesfield.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The visitors made the brighter start and almost went ahead in the fifth minute, with Gus Mafuta freed by Danny Johnson to win a corner that James Bolton narrowly put wide.
The Silkmen were having the best of the possession but they were struggling to convert it into chances until two minutes before the break. Chris Holroyd latched on to a long ball and got round Gateshead goalkeeper James Montgomery - but Manny Smith was on-hand to clear.
Defender Smith opened the scoring in the 75th minute, stabbing home after Scott Flinders had initially saved Paddy McLaughlin's effort.
However, the home side rescued a point just seven minutes later when John McCombe rose highest to head home a free-kick.
Meanwhile, Macclesfield have re-signed Bury winger Jack Mackreth on loan until the end of the season.
The 24-year-old, who was previously at the club between 2012 and 2014, spent the first half of the current season with the Silkmen, making 25 appearances in all competitions after returning on a free in June, before leaving for Bury in January.
