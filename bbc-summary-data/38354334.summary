At Glebe Park, Ally Love fired Brechin ahead on the quarter-hour and that lead was doubled by Connor McLennan's free-kick before half-time.
Stranraer had Steven Bell sent off in the second half for two bookings.
Queen's Park went ahead away to Alloa through Ross Millen's 62nd-minute shot, but the hosts were level within seven minutes through Greig Spence's strike.
The Fifers moved out of the bottom two after scoring two second-half goals against Peterhead, Jason Kerr then Kevin O'Hara firing in.
Smith's side were replaced in ninth by Stranraer, who are only two points ahead of Stenny.
