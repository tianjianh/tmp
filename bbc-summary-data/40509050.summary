Burns was dropped twice - on 98 and 154 - as he batted throughout the entire day to move the hosts on from 113-1.
He shared a 104-run partnership with Dominic Sibley (57) but, despite the flat pitch, Hampshire, led by Kyle Abbott (2-45), kept chipping away.
A 62-run stand with Tom Curran (35 not out) saw Surrey reach stumps 89 runs short of the follow-on target of 499.
Burns batted superbly for his first Championship century of the season, striking 22 boundaries all around the ground, although he was fortunate that Sean Ervine and Rilee Rossouw could not hold edges in the slip cordon off Fidel Edwards and Mason Crane.
Hampshire began the day looking for 19 wickets to win and started well when Crane, who bowled unchanged for the entire first session, had nightwatchman Conor McKerr lbw.
Scott Borthwick feathered Abbott behind and Jason Roy (27) was trapped by an inswinger from Gareth Berg before Burns and Sibley steadied the innings with an important stand.
Abbott had Sibley lbw and a pacey and aggressive burst from Edwards shot out Ben Foakes and Sam Curran before Tom Curran and Burns secured a fourth batting point and reached the close.
