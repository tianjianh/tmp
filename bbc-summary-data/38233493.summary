Abuot 400 old vehicles are on fire at the Moorfield Drive Industrial estate in Altham, near Accrington. More than 80 firefighters are at the yard.
Lancashire Police said smoke drifted across the M65 between Rishton and Accrington. Two lanes were closed eastbound.
Residents are being asked to keep their windows closed and avoid the area.
Lancashire Fire and Rescue said crews were starting to have a "significant effect" on the blaze after being called to the yard at about 04:40 GMT.
The blaze quickly spread due to a "strong breeze", it added.
A hazardous materials unit has joined firefighters to advise on protecting the environment and public health.
The Environment Agency said it was working with the fire service.
