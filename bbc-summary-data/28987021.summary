England face India in the third one-day international at Trent Bridge on Saturday bidding to recover from a 133-run loss in the second ODI at Cardiff.
Hales hit 40 on his ODI debut and is set to bat with Cook for only the second time on his home ground.

"I hope our games can feed off each other, and we can get that partnership going," Hales said.
As England seek to level the five-match series, Hales, 25, is bidding to consolidate on his encouraging start.
His half-century stand with Cook offset an otherwise miserable performance from the home batsmen.
Cook's ODI record has come under criticism from former England team-mate Graeme Swann but Hales has backed his skipper.
"I really enjoyed the start we had, and hope there are more of those partnerships to come," he said.
"He's a very technically sound guy and he's the right guy at the top of the order.
"I hope he'll show everyone in this series what he can do."
Hales believes India deserve credit for their skilled and clever bowling last time out but expects them to find it more difficult on a different pitch.
"They were just very cunning," he said. "Once I got past 30, they were one step ahead of me.
"So it's up to me to put that right, and have that game smartness.
"We feel a lot more prepared now, and this pitch will be a lot easier to score on and take the game back to their bowlers."
India have suffered a setback ahead of the the third ODI with the news batsman Rohit Sharma has been ruled out for the rest of the tour of England with a broken finger.
Sharma, 27, was injured during India's win on Wednesday.
Test opener Murali Vijay has been called up as a replacement, but is unlikely to arrive in time for the ODI at Trent Bridge.
Sharma was promoted to the top of the India batting order in January 2013, and made 52 against England in Cardiff.
In a statement, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said: "Rohit Sharma has sustained a fracture on the middle finger of his right hand, and has been ruled out of the ongoing ODI and T20 International Series against England as a result."
The middle-order batsman featured just once in the five-match Test series over the summer, scoring 28 and six in the third Test at Southampton in England's 266-run victory.
