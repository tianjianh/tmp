The alleged offences were said to have happened at Underley Hall boarding school in Kirkby Lonsdale, which closed in 2012, Cumbria Police said.
The arrests were made in Cumbria, Lancashire and West Yorkshire.
Supt Rob O'Connor said it was a "complex investigation" involving people "across the country and abroad".
The seven men and one woman were arrested as part of Operation Tweed, launched by the force in 2014.
Five of them have been released on bail while three are still being questioned by police.
The allegations date back to the 1970s, '80s and '90s.
