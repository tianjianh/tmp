[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Twelve people have been jailed over the deaths of four people whose quad bike was hit by a car travelling at 140mph.

The four died when they were hit by Daniel Raynor's Nissan 350Z which was racing on the A6201 Hemsworth bypass in 2015.
Raynor, 24, from Barnsley, admitted four counts of causing death by dangerous driving.
Passenger Matthew Todd, 23, from Barnsley was also jailed for nine years after admitting the same offences.
Ten other people were sentenced at Leeds Crown Court for between 42 and 52 weeks for encouraging the dangerous driving which resulted in the deaths of Ryan Beal, 20, Brandon Brown, 20, Alexandra Binns, 18, and Terrie Kirby, 16.
The scenes that led to the deaths were likened to the film The Fast And The Furious during the trial.

In a joint statement, the families of the victims said: "No sentence will ever make up for what was done to our families on September 27, 2015.
"We lost sons and daughters just entering the prime of their lives. We lost the chance of seeing the people they would have grown into, and the family lives they could have had.
"The pain of that loss may lessen but it will never go away, and our families will always be left with the knowledge they will never again be whole."
Det Insp Richard Holmes of West Yorkshire Police said the crash had been an "absolute tragedy" for the victims' families and had "seriously affected" the officers who handled the case.
"On that tragic night, the car driven by Raynor with Todd as a passenger was recorded at a speeds of 140mph when it hit the quad bike the four were on, causing the devastating injuries we sadly saw," he said.
"Driving at this speed, on a 60mph road, was an act of utter stupidity and extreme recklessness which frankly beggars belief.
"Raynor posed a massive danger to anyone else he came into contact with on that road and tragically, when he did, the consequences of his actions were devastating."
Stephen Hebden, 23, and Nathan Jackson, 21, both from Barnsley, were each jailed for 12 months after being found guilty of encouraging dangerous driving.
