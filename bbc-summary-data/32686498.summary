A woman who claimed her car was moved by council workers on to newly painted double yellow lines said it was "crazy" she had been given a parking ticket.

Clair Morris insisted she parked her Mazda MX-5 legally near her home in West Didsbury, Manchester, on Thursday.
In order to allow fresh yellow lines to be painted that day, she believed her sports car was moved to a spot over the road, which had parking restrictions.
Manchester City Council has apologised and said the ticket would be cancelled.
Ms Morris told BBC News that she discovered a parking ticket on her windscreen on Sunday, when she went to Northern Grove to pick up her vehicle, which she calls "Tracey".
Alongside the parking ticket - which had been issued earlier that day - she said there was a vehicle "re-position notice" from Manchester City Council which was dated 7 May - the day she had left her car on the other side of the road.
"It is crazy," said the 33-year-old. "I know traffic wardens have a job to do but you would have thought common sense would have prevailed.
"Someone passing told me they saw my car being lifted by a tow-truck and moved across the road.
"They thought I was being towed away."
A Manchester City Council spokesman told BBC News: "The car should not have been moved to a location with double yellow lines, and this ticket should not have been issued and will be cancelled.
"Our contractors apologise for this error and we are now insisting that they follow our strict codes of conduct."
Ms Morris said she was "relieved and pleased that they've cancelled the ticket... it will save me a lot of bother".
