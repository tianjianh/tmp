Welsh Cup Semi Finals: Pontypridd edge out Cross Keys in thriller

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Former Wales international Ceri Sweeney carried Pontypridd to the final of the WRU National Cup with a virtuoso display in a 42-37 win over Cross Keys.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Sweeney scored 22 points as Pontypridd withstood a spirited Keys comeback.
The game seemed secure for the hosts at 39-16, but three tries in four minutes from the Gwent side set up the most unlikely of comeback victories, before Sweeney's late penalty settled nerves.
RGC 1404 will meet Pontypridd in the final after they beat Merthyr 24-20.
