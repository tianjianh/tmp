[SN]TITLE[SN]
New Fair Isle bird observatory opening

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A famous bird observatory on Fair Isle, off Shetland, is set to reopen after a Â£4m rebuilding programme.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
There has been a local facility for 60 years and it is the lynchpin of the island's economy due to its key role for bird watchers and research.
Funding sources include the Scottish government's rural development fund, Shetland Islands Council and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.
It is hoped even more visitors will now come to Fair Isle.
