Conlan failed to make a senior appearance for Burnley, but played in 16 games for the Shrimps last season after joining on loan in January.
The 20-year-old has also previously spent time on loan with Scottish Championship club St Mirren.
"Luke came in on loan last season and put in some strong performances," Morecambe manager Jim Bentley said.
"He's young, got plenty of potential and will only get better the more he plays and adapts to football at League Two level."
Morecambe finished 21st in the table last season, 12 points clear of the relegation zone.
