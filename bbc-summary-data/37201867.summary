Kieran McDade was taken to hospital after collapsing while on the pitch at Dunbeth Football Club in Coatbridge on 18 August.
The club confirmed on Facebook that the teenager died in hospital on Friday morning.
It is now raising funds to help Kieran's family through a JustGiving page.
His sister, Amy, has said that Kieran donated some of his organs, which had already saved the lives of two other people.
A statement posted on the Dunbeth FC Facebook page said: "It is with a broken heart that I have to inform you all that Kieran McDade of our 2003 squad passed away this morning.
"Kieran collapsed at training last Thursday and although all efforts by coaching staff, paramedics, doctors and all the prayers that people said it just wasn't enough.
"This is the most heartbreaking situation that any parent could go through and all the people connected to Dunbeth FC send their condolences to Bernie, Gemma, Amy and all extended family and friends."
The club said Kieran was a "big happy go lucky boy and all his team mates and coaches will miss him terribly."
It added: "A popular boy who gave his all for his team and will forever be remembered for the League Championship he proudly won with his team mates and all the good memories that came with that.
"He was a founder member of the 2003 squad and secured his place as our No 8 which we all knew he treasured dearly.
"It doesn't matter what words I use they will never explain the feeling we have for Kieran or the loss that we share with his family.
"He has left us all with cherished memories but ones that will forever be tinged with sadness that he is not here to relive them with us. Rest in peace KM8."
The Forth Valley Football Development Association (FVFDA) announced on Facebook earlier that as a mark of respect a minute's silence will be held at all youth games on Saturday and no games will be cancelled as "Kieran loved his football".
Following the incident last week messages of support from friends, family and Scottish football players flooded in for the youngster, hoping that he would pull through.
Kieran's sister Amy paid tribute to her brother on Facebook earlier and revealed that he donated some of his organs which have saved two lives.
She wrote: "My family would like to thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts for the overwhelming prayers and support you have given us.
"Our beautiful boy is now with the angels and will forever live on in our hearts.
"Would also like to let everyone know that Kieran has remained the most sensitive and generous boy that he is and donated some of his organs which has saved two peoples lives today. What a brave soldier, he will be truly missed."
