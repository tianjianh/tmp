The GB team, who were third overnight, ended the weekend in Gateshead on 338 points, 9.5pts behind Germany and 16.5 behind winners Russia.
It was Britain's best points total in the four editions of the new format of the competition.
But they missed departing head coach Peter Eriksson's aim of a top-two spot.
The blustery and wet conditions caused all sorts of problems with the men's pole vault and women's high jump having to be held indoors.
Britain's third place was definitely above my expectations, and their overall tally of 338 points our highest ever score in the tournament.
But we should also marvel at the power of Russia who retained their title despite experimental selections in many events and without their household names like Borzakovskiy, Isinbaeva and Savinova. They are going to be even tougher to beat in Moscow in August.
On the track, Porter ran an impressive 12.62 seconds in the blustery and wet conditions to win the 100m hurdles - an improvement on her European leading mark of 12.74, although there was an illegal following wind of +2.6m/s.
"I'm really pleased with that race," she said. "I'm feeling good, I've been working on certain elements of my race and it's all coming together. I'm pretty confident about the rest of the season."
The women's relay quartet of Eilidh Child, Shana Cox, Meghan Beesley and Christine Ohuruogu led from start to finish as they crossed the line in three minutes and 28.60 seconds, nearly a second clear of Russia.
The men were equally dominant as Michael Bingham, Conrad Williams, Rhys Williams and Richard Buck won in a European leading time of 3:05.37.
Teenager Emelia Gorecka held off the challenge of the experienced German Sabrina Mockenhaupt to finish second in the 5,000m while Sophie Hitchon set a new British hammer record of 72.97m to finish third in her event.
"I've been chasing that 72-metre barrier for a while now so I'm really pleased to have finally got it," she said.

There were also third-place finishes for Shara Proctor (long jump), Anyika Onuora (200m), Andrew Osagie (800m and Nathan Douglas (triple jump).
Eriksson, who is leaving to return to his native Canada for family reasons, was full of praise for the younger members of his team.
"I think it was good; we had more points than we expected and a lot of the youngsters stepped up with really great performances," he said. "We were unlucky with a couple of injuries to Holly Bleasdale and in the men's 3,000m steeplechase but we did the best we could.
"All of the youngsters really stepped up, with Emelia Gorecka today and Jessica Judd and Charlie Grice yesterday putting in excellent performances."
