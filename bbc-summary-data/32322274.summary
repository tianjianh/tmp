The father-of-two's body parts were found over several days on 1 April last year in White Hart Lakes in Dagenham.

The pair were also found guilty at Blackfriars Crown Court of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

A sixth man, Colin Bushaway, 61 of Eltham, south London, was acquitted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.
The victim had last been seen alive on the evening of 13 March 2014 when he was with the men at Quye's flat.
While there, Mr Buchel, who was staying at Hunt's flat at the time of his death, was brutally assaulted and died from his injuries.
