A fresh appeal to find the killer of a teenage girl who was raped and murdered in Manchester 45 years ago is to feature on BBC One's Crimewatch.

Dorothy Leyden's body was found hours after she had been to a Jimmy Ruffin concert at the Golden Garter nightclub in Wythenshawe in April 1971.
The 17-year-old's body was found on waste ground in Collyhurst.
Her sister Pat Atkinson has made an emotional appeal for more information on her death.
The teenager spent the evening of 24 April 1971 at the concert before heading into central Manchester.
At about 02:30, she got out of a taxi she had shared with friends at Piccadilly Gardens bus station and it is thought she decided to walk home.
Her body was found the following day behind the now demolished Spread Eagle pub.
A reconstruction will show some of Dorothy's last known movements before she was attacked.
Previously, it had been thought she may have been murdered by serial killer Trevor Hardy but, this was dismissed in 2008.
Det Supt Martin Bottomley, from Greater Manchester Police, said forensic evidence proved he did not kill Dorothy.
"The suspicion that Hardy was responsible may have allowed the real killer to hide for all of this time."
Dorothy's sister recalled the moment officers broke the news of her sister's murder.
She told Crimewatch: "I remember the police coming to the front door and I just went out playing and when I came home my mum called me into the living room.
"I think she told us all one at a time and she just told me that Dorothy had been beaten and she'd died."
The appeal will be shown on Crimewatch later on BBC One at 21:00 BST.
