The Blue Brazil's Kyle Miller was the culprit for the spot-kick miss after Fabio Capuano was judged to have handballed in the box.
Earlier, Kilby's Joao Victoria had hit the crossbar with a header in what was an evenly matched contest.
Central Park is the venue for the return game next Saturday.
Kilby will be heartened that there was nothing to suggest a major gulf in the level the two sides were at on the pitch.
Fraser Mullen's fine shot after only 20 seconds made it look like Cowdenbeath would control things.
But East Kilbride settled and had an equally good chance when Victoria set up Sean Winter. The talisman's effort was well saved by Jamie Sneddon.
Dale Carrick had a couple of half-chances for the visitors, who struggled at times to cope with the trickery and pace of Portuguese striker Victoria.
He guided his header on to the junction of post and crossbar when Craig McLeish supplied a decent cross.
The real drama came five minutes from time when Capuano was penalised for a handball that did not seem deliberate.
Initially, referee Gavin Duncan looked like he was not going to award the spot-kick, but one of his assistants flagged and, after a brief conversation, Cowdenbeath had a great chance to take an advantage back to Fife.
Miller struck it low to the left, but PE teacher McGinley sprang to his right to repel the spot-kick.
East Kilbride manager Martin Lauchlan: "The game had everything and it was exciting. I was a wee bit frustrated we didn't make the breakthrough.
"One linesman, from 40 yards, gets involved (in the penalty award) in something that looks like absolutely nothing, although I'll need to see it back. We had a penalty shout of our own that nobody got involved in.
"I always knew it was going to be tight. Hopefully it doesn't go to penalties and we can do it in normal time."
Cowdenbeath manager Gary Locke: "That's the sixth penalty we've missed in a row but it was a good save by the goalkeeper to be fair. Penalties are a problem for us.
"It was an end-to-end game and I thought a draw was fair. We know we'll be in for a game next week.
"There's nerves in both sides because it means so much."
