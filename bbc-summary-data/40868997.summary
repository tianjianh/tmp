Following on from their 23-10 Challenge Cup win in April, they again restricted Leigh to two tries, from Daniel Mortimer and Atelea Vea.
But Rovers ran in three themselves from the experienced Shaun Lunt, who got two, and winger Ryan Shaw.
Jamie Ellis kicked four goals for Rovers, as did Leigh's Josh Drinkwater.
Both sides had won their opening game in The Qualifiers, but only Rovers and Warrington, who beat Catalans Dragons, now have 100 per cent records.
Leigh coach Neil Jukes:
"Ultimately it was a game of inches - both teams competed high and kicked pretty well. Nobody gave each other an inch.
"There was a clear knock-on in the build-up to Lunt's second try and even though it went to the screen they (the video ref) didn't even look at it.
"In a game of that magnitude, you can't get those things wrong. It's a tough competition. Losing has not made it impossible. It has just added pressure on the next few games."
Hull KR coach Tim Sheens:
"To win two out of two and one against a Super League side certainly helps, there's no doubt about that. Leigh completed at a very high rate and they battered us in the middle.
"We got lucky on the play the ball for Lunt's try on the try-line. And we hung in right till the end. We were not as clever as them with our kicking options but we managed to keep turning their fellahs around.
"We will enjoy the win but it means nothing if we don't come out with the right attitude next week. London at home will be a tough game again."
