National Living Wage has not led to job losses - survey

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Employers have responded to the new National Living Wage (NLW) by raising prices or reducing profits rather than cutting jobs, according to a new survey from the Resolution Foundation.

The wage, which requires employers to pay staff aged 25 and over at least Â£7.20 an hour, was introduced in April.
This report is the first snapshot of how firms have reacted to the NLW.
It comes after the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted it would lead to 60,000 job losses by 2020.
Five hundred companies, covering a range of UK businesses, were questioned just before the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.
Some 36% of those affected by the NLW said they had put up their prices to compensate for the higher wage cost, while 29% said they had reduced their profits.
Despite reports of some employers cutting back on staff terms and conditions, the survey found that only 8% had cut paid breaks, overtime or bank holiday pay.
Separately, the not-for-profit Resolution Foundation think tank warned the UK's decision to leave the EU could affect the government's new wage policy.
It said the so-called Brexit would likely reshape the landscape in which many low pay sectors operate, creating huge uncertainty about the outlook for earnings over the coming years.
Weaker wage growth, it said, could reduce the current projected real terms value of the NLW by up to 40 pence an hour by 2020.
The policy was announced in last summer's Budget by Chancellor George Osborne, in what he said was a move to create a higher-wage, lower-welfare economy.
Workers aged 21 to 24 continue to be paid the National Minimum Wage of Â£6.70 an hour.
The DIY chain B&Q, supermarket Tesco, coffee chain Caffe Nero and the John Lewis Partnership have all this year reduced some staff payments or perks, but most have said the moves were unrelated to the 50p-an-hour increase in the National Living Wage (NLW).
