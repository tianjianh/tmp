EU referendum: Labour urges its voters not to back Brexit

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Many Labour voters don't know the party backs remaining in the EU and it could lead to a Leave vote in the referendum, senior party figures have warned.

Former leader Ed Miliband said the referendum result was "in question" and urged Labour supporters not to use it as a protest vote against the Tories.
The party's top brass is warning Labour voters would be hit hardest by Brexit.
But backbenchers John Mann and Dennis Skinner have both rejected the official position and joined the Out campaign.
Mr Mann said Labour voters disagreed with the party leadership on the EU issue and a "people's revolution is underway".
Labour's deputy Tom Watson and other senior party figures presented figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which he said showed Â£18bn of spending cuts and tax rises would be in the pipeline in the event of the UK leaving the EU.
The figure - dismissed as "fanciful" and "ridiculous" by Vote Leave - is based on Labour's claim that a post-Brexit Conservative government would "look to announce further austerity if they are to balance the books by the end of the Parliament" - due to their predicted "hit to the UK economy" of a Leave vote.
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
Mr Watson said Labour was "clear that Britain is better off in Europe" and said that a "Tory Brexit budget" would "hit working people hard" while Ms Cooper said the Leave campaign was "being led by the hard right of the Tory party" who had "never been friends to public services or low-paid workers".
There have been reports suggesting that many Labour voters do not realise the party is in favour of remaining in the EU.
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said several senior figures had told her they were genuinely worried that many Labour voters would vote to leave the EU.
Mr Watson said the "Labour Party is about as united as it possibly can be in asking people to Remain" but added: "The one thing that does concern me is that the polls seem to say that about 40% of Labour supporters don't yet know our position ... There are two weeks to go, we need to get that message out, we need to redouble our efforts."

And Shadow Business Secretary Angela Eagle urged Labour voters not to use the 23 June referendum to give the Remain-supporting Conservative government a "bloody nose".
"I have fought the Tories all my life but this not a referendum on the government. It is about the future of our country and the Labour Party believes passionately that our future lies in Europe."
In further efforts to win over Labour voters to the Remain cause, former leader Ed Miliband claims that senior Leave campaigners want to abolish measures protecting workers' rights.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme ahead of his speech, Mr Miliband said "the referendum is in question and that's why the Labour message has got to be heard" - amid a focus on "blue-on-blue" Conservative in-fighting.
He added: "We haven't done enough yet, we've got to do more. But people know where Labour stands."
It follows comments by shadow home secretary Mr Burnham, who told BBC Two's Newsnight: "We have definitely been far too much Hampstead and not enough Hull in recent times and we need to change that. Here we are two weeks away from the very real prospect that Britain will vote for isolation."
But Mr Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, in Nottinghamshire, told the BBC on Friday: "It's not that Labour's not getting its message across, it's that Labour voters are fundamentally disagreeing."
And former Labour minister Frank Field, who is also campaigning for a Leave vote, warned that the party risked losing votes to UKIP with its Remain stance. He said the party should be encouraging supporters to vote "as they believe is in the best interests of our country" instead.
"In trying to scare Labour voters to back Remain, our leadership is on course to lose another one million votes to UKIP, just as we did in 2015," said Mr Field.
On the claims that Â£18bn of cuts would follow a "Brexit" vote, a  Vote Leave spokesman said: "As support drains away from the Remain campaign, they are getting ever more desperate and hysterical with their fanciful Leave predictions."
