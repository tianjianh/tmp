Gareth Maybin misses out on European Tour Card in Spain

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gareth Maybin was unable to summon up any final-days heroics at the European Tour School as he missed out on a card for 2015 by six shots.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Maybin, six shots off a qualifying spot overnight, started promisingly with two birdies but then bogeyed the third before double-bogeying the fifth.
The Ballyclare man managed five further birdies but never seriously threatened to win a card as he signed for a 71.
Peter Lawrie missed out by one with Simon Thornton a further shot adrift.
In the high-pressure final round, Lawrie would have sneaked into the top 25 had to managed to play his final six holes in one under but six pars didn't prove enough for the Dubliner as he also shot a 71.
Thornton's steady closing 71 proved two shots too many for him as his second bogey of the day on the 15th effectively sealed his fate.
Kevin Phelan endured a chastening final day as his seven-bogey 76 dropped him back to level par and a shot adrift of Maybin.
After failing to secure cards, the Irish quartet will probably have to confine most of their competitive efforts to the Challenge Tour although they can expect to secure a number of starts on the main tour.
Northern Irishman man Maybin finished in 124th in this year's Race to Dubai standings some 44,000 Euro outside the 111th spot which would have ensured safety.
Maybin secured his European Tour six years ago after an impressive 2008 season on the Challenge Tour.
He finished 40th in the European Order of Merit in 2010 but has had to battle to hold on to his card in recent seasons before losing his playing privileges last month.
Finland's Mikko Korhonen won the qualifying school on 20 under after firing an impressive closing 67.
Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalez was runner-up on 18 under with Italian Renato Paratore next on 16 under.
English talent Matthew Fitzpatrick secured on the precious cards after finishing on 10 under while Northern Ireland Open Challenge winner Joakim Lagergren also progressed on nine under.
