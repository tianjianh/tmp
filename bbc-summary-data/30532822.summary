The Interview: Things that should outrage North Korea more than a Seth Rogen film

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Sony's film The Interview has been pulled after hackers threatened a 9/11 style attack on any cinemas which screened the comedy.

The movie, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, features a fictional plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un.
A leaked scene from the film showed the leader's head engulfed in a slow-motion fireball.
Hackers, calling themselves the Guardians of Peace, warned of a "bitter fate" for viewers of the "awful" film.
There has been speculation that North Korea is behind the attack, which revealed scripts from upcoming movies as well as stars' salaries and employees' personal emails.
Although North Korea deny involvement, they have said the movie is an "act of terrorism" and promised  "merciless" retaliation if it was released.
Most recently they described the hack as a "righteous deed" and said may have been carried out by its "supporters and sympathisers".
However, perhaps North Korea has more to worry about than a movie described by one critic as "muddled muck".
It may want to start by looking at these very real problems its citizens are facing.
WARNING: this article contains details some may find disturbing.
More than a quarter of all North Korean children have had their growth stunted from malnourishment.
Two-thirds of the population, approximately 16 million people, don't know where their next meal is coming from, according to the UN.
This lack of food means than North Korean men are, on average, between 3 - 8cm (1.2 - 3.1in) shorter than men in South Korea.
North Korea has built up its military arsenal and nuclear programme instead of helping feed its people, another United Nations report found.
The situation has been made worse as families' movement is strictly controlled by the state, making it hard for them to source food.
Earlier this year, Michael Kirby, who led a UN Commission of Inquiry into North Korean human rights violations, told BBC World Service that families were being forced to use the ashes of their relatives as fertiliser due to lack of other resources.
Meanwhile large amounts of government money is spent on the Supreme Leader and "the advancement of his personality cult."   Kim Jong-Il, Kim Jong-un's late father, reportedly spent Â£700,000 a year on Hennessy cognac.
The horrific conditions in North Korean gulags or work camps are beyond what even the most sadistically minded screenwriter could imagine.
Inside these compounds, prisoners are forced to carry out back-breaking labour, tortured if they don't obey the rules, left to die when injured and deliberately starved to death.
Former inmate Jeong Kwang-il, who fled North Korea in 2003, told a UN panel he dropped a third of his body weight in three months at a detention centre.
"Then they hang you so you would not be able to stand or sit," he said.
"If you are hung like that for three days, four days, you urinate, you defecate, you are totally dehydratedâ€¦ [it] was so painful that I felt it was better to die."
Prisoners are forced to bury the bodies of those who died.
Except in winter they can't because the ground is frozen hard, so they are stored in a warehouse until March.
Jeong Kwang-il wrote in The Guardian: "When we got into the warehouse to remove the corpses, it was really horrible since the bodies were rotten and eaten by rats. We buried corpses as if they were trash. No one knows or remembers who they were."
Parents, grandparents and children are all punished for the "sins" of one relative. Shin Dong-hyuk, 30, is believed to be the first person born in a prison camp who managed to escape.
Shin thinks that he and his family were imprisoned because two of his uncles defected to South Korea during the Korean War. He saw his own mother executed.
Despite multiple reports condemning North Korea for how it treats its citizens, the country brushes these aside as misunderstandings.
Earlier in September North Korea published a 50,000-word report saying its citizens "enjoy genuine human rights" and there had simply been "serious misunderstandings."
On Tuesday North Korea's UN ambassador, Ja Song-nam said that "the so-called 'human rights issue' in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is politically fabricated" and instead asked for the United Nations Security council to look into reports of CIA torture.
