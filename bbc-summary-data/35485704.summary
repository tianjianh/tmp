Kike: Middlesbrough striker signs for Spanish side Eibar

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Middlesbrough striker Kike has left the Championship club to join Spanish side Eibar for an undisclosed fee.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Kike scored 16 goals in 75 appearances for Boro after joining from Real Murcia in July 2014.
The 26-year-old featured in 24 games for Aitor Karanka's side this season, but has scored only once since August.
Middlesbrough, who signed striker Jordan Rhodes and Enrique Sola in January, are second in the table, one point behind leaders Hull.
BBC Tees understand that Kike, who has signed a two-and-half-year contract with Eibar, will not be able to play until the start of next season due to a delay in processing the paperwork.
