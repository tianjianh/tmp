[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Premier League leaders Manchester City continued their 100% start to the season with an injury-time winner over Crystal Palace.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Nigerian teenager Kelechi Iheanacho stabbed home his first senior goal after Samir Nasri's shot was saved.
After a scrappy first half, Jesus Navas shot wide of an empty net for City after rounding keeper Alex McCarthy.
Sergio Aguero limped out with a knee injury, three days before Juventus's Champions League visit.
Club-record signing Kevin de Bruyne was brought on in his place as a first-half substitute, with managers Manuel Pellegrini and Alan Pardew having a heated argument over the incident.
Palace defender Scott Dann received a yellow card for the late challenge on Argentine Aguero as City spent a large part of the match struggling to create offensively.
A well-organised Palace came closest when Dwight Gayle volleyed wide.
Reaction to this match and the rest of Saturday's action
Read how Man City snatched a late victory here
The 18-year-old Nigerian striker had previously played three minutes and 49 seconds for Manchester City, in the 2-0 win over Watford.
He came on for Wilfried Bony with a couple of minutes remaining on Saturday and just 54 seconds later was alert enough to tap home a close-range rebound after Alex McCarthy spilled Samir Nasri's shot.
Having signed for City in 2014, from Taye Academy in Nigeria, he impressed on the club's pre-season tours of Australia, Vietnam and Germany.
He played five times, scored twice and could now be considered as City's third-choice striker.
Without the Argentine on the field, City struggled to create many clear-cut chances despite dominating possession, until Iheanacho's late intervention.
Their start to the campaign - five wins from five and no goals conceded - suggests they have the confidence to finally test the best in Europe, ahead of Tuesday's visit of the Italian champions.

But, with Aguero now surely a major doubt and Raheem Sterling missing Saturday with a slight hamstring injury, City could have to rely on Wilfried Bony to show why £28m was paid for the Ivory Coast striker last season.
After the loan departure of Edin Dzeko to Roma, Bony is City's only other out and out forward, although City boss Manuel Pellegrini has hinted Iheanacho could be much more involved this season.
"He's just 18 and started working with our squad last season, but he was unlucky and had a big injury in the last three months of the season," he said.
"This year he started pre-season with the squad and will be a very important player for the future. He's one of the reasons I didn't bring another striker in when we sold Edin Dzeko.
"He deserves that chance."
Results in the Premier League so far this season have shown the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal have struggled to see off teams they would be expected to beat.
But Manchester City have had no such problems and on Saturday dominated a battling Crystal Palace - who beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last time out.
City are now 11 points clear of champions Chelsea in the Premier League and five ahead of second-placed Arsenal. Far from over but ominous signs for their rivals.

Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew: "Even though we beat Manchester City last season this was a better performance.
"It's a shame about the injury to Aguero because we are not a malicious team. We both knew this was going to be a tough game and it was."
Manchester City host Juventus in their Champions League opener on Tuesday night, while Crystal Palace travel to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday.
