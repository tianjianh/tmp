Islamic State (IS) militants have released a video purportedly showing the killing of up to 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Footage shows one group of men being beheaded on a beach and another group being shot in the head in a desert.
The victims are believed to be members of the Ethiopian Church seized in Libya by IS-linked militants.
The video is similar to previous ones posted by IS, including the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians in February.
The latest tape is 29 minutes long and bears the official logo of the media arm of IS. Its authenticity has not been independently verified.
In the video, a masked militant with a gun is seen making a statement threatening Christians if they do not convert to Islam or pay a special tax.
IS has in recent months published a number of videos apparently showing the killing of its hostages, drawing condemnation around the world.
The militants control large swathes of Iraq and Syria, but have also won the backing of jihadist groups across the Middle East and North Africa, including Libya.
