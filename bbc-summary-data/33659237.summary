L/Cpl Michael Campbell, of Colwyn Bay, north Wales, was shot while on patrol with 3rd Battalion, The Royal Welsh.
The Army reservist died at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Thursday. Colleagues described the 32-year-old as an "outstanding soldier" who was "determined" and "courageous".
It means 454 UK service personnel died as a result of the Afghanistan mission.
Paying tribute to him, the MoD said : "L/Cpl Campbell epitomised everything a reservist in 3 R Welsh should be - dedicated, professional and willing to volunteer on operations wherever he was required, a true Welsh warrior.
"The battalion has lost a charismatic and loyal friend and our thoughts and condolences are with his wife Chrissy and his wider family at this very difficult time."
Colleagues have also paid tribute to L/Cpl Campbell, who they called a "true reservist".
Retired Lt Col Stephen Webb said: "He was an outstanding soldier and very talented junior commander: skilful, determined, measured and very courageous: he set an excellent example to those around him."
Maj Charlie Carver said L/Cpl Campbell was "one of life's true characters".
He said: "One of the reasons that he was able to fit seamlessly into the company was his keen sense of humour; he excelled at the banter which only soldiers seem to understand."
L/Cpl Campbell had joined the Army Reserves in April 2002 and was deployed with the 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, as a platoon radio operator in October 2011.
He was struck in the stomach while crossing a road in Helmand in April 2012, having been confronted by "accurate, heavy and sustained enemy fire".
Members of his convoy returned fire, with L/Cpl Campbell engaging the enemy firing position, the MoD said in a statement, adding: "Despite being wounded, L/Cpl Campbell continued to suppress the enemy, drawing fire on to himself so that the remainder of the multiple could cross an open and exposed area to get into better cover."
He was evacuated first to Camp Bastion and then to the Birmingham hospital, where he was readmitted earlier this year.
Before being deployed to Afghanistan in late 2011, L/Cpl Campbell had served on a number of other tours, including in Iraq, and proved to be a "highly capable soldier", the MoD said.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon described L/Cpl Campbell as "proud and professional" and a "dedicated family man".
He said: "The tributes of his comrades describe L/Cpl Michael Campbell as a popular and committed soldier devoted to his regiment and a dedicated family man.
"Proud and professional, he epitomised the ethos of the Army reservist and he had completed numerous tours duty in Afghanistan and Iraq.
"It is particularly tragic that Michael Campbell should die of wounds after such a period of time and I send my deepest condolences to his family and loved ones at this sad time."
