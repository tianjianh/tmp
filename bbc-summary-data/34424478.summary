Better signage call for Dartford crossing, MP says

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Improved signage at the approaches to the Dartford crossing would help to solve congestion, the local MP has said.

Gareth Johnson, Tory MP for Dartford, was speaking after a summit meeting called to discuss traffic problems since toll booths were removed.
He said congestion at the River Thames crossing also caused traffic delays elsewhere in the Dartford area.
Highways England said progress was being made at the crossing.
The free-flow payment system, which saw barriers removed and motorists charged through number plate recognition cameras, came into force in November.
Thursday's meeting included officials from the Department for Transport, Kent Police, Kent County Council and Dartford Borough Council.
Mr Johnson said no one claimed to have a magic wand to solve traffic problems at the Dartford Crossing but getting all parties responsible for running the crossing working together was important.
He called for a review of road signs on the approaches to the crossing "making it clear which lanes are better for lorries".
He said congestion on two roundabouts on the approaches to the crossing also caused "big traffic issues" in Dartford town centre.
"These problems will not be completely resolved until another bridge is built which, in my opinion, needs to be located east of Gravesend," he said.
After Mr Johnson raised the issue in parliament last month, Highways England said journey times had "improved significantly".
