[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Newport County boss Graham Westley believes an FA Cup third-round clash at Liverpool could transform the club.

The Exiles, who are bottom of the Football League, will travel to Anfield if they can beat Plymouth in a second-round replay at Rodney Parade.
The two teams drew 0-0 at Home Park, but Westley warned there is still work to do if the Exiles are to enjoy the benefits of facing Jurgen Klopp's side.
"Financially, it's a game-changer." Westley told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
Westley has had previous experience of success in the FA Cup, but has warned Newport to focus squarely on their replay with Plymouth.
"When I was at Stevenage, the FA Cup runs were the reason the training ground got built," he said.
"I know the difference that FA Cup runs can make that's why I've always placed such importance on it in my managerial career.
"It's a great opportunity, but it remains just that, we have to focus on the replay. It does not pay in these circumstances to start dreaming, you've got to keep your mind on the job.
"It's an unbelievable draw for a small club, but we won't put the cart before the horse."
As a fan-owned club County have had to operate on a limited budget for a long time, but chairman Gavin Foxall says a trip to Anfield could safeguard the future of the club.
"It would absolutely be a massive financial boost for us," said Foxall.
"Certainly for a club like ours it would secure the future for a season or two at least. It would be extremely welcome and would boost the coffers enormously.
"We are delighted, but there is a very difficult game with Plymouth first.
"A game at Anfield against Liverpool would rank right up there in the club's history."
As for Westley, who joined the club in October and has overseen an upturn in the Exiles' League Two fortunes, the real third-round draw proved a lot more satisfying than one his young son had insisted on conducting the day before.
"My little boy wanted to do the FA Cup draw on Sunday," Westley added.
"He pulled us out against Eastleigh or Halifax away so it was a bit of a better result for us when it went out for real.  It's a big prize, it's a great opportunity.  From our point of view it's a great motivation for the replay."
That replay will take place at Rodney Parade on Tuesday, 13 December.
