The BBC spoke to three people who were robbed after they advertised their properties on the accommodation-booking service.
The scammers hijacked accounts with verified badges and changed some of personal details to pull off the thefts.
Airbnb said it had already been working on the changes – which include sending text warnings if profiles are altered – when the crimes were brought to its attention.
"Unfortunately there have been some incidents where hosts and guests have suffered," said Nate Blecharczyk, co-founder of Airbnb.
"This is not acceptable to us, therefore we’re working around the clock to do everything we can to improve our detection and prevention methods."
