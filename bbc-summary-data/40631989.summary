Nell Ryder, of Chester, travelled to Liverpool on Saturday to carry out the final wishes of her Toxteth-born husband John by spreading his ashes on the River Mersey.
When they returned to the car from a family meal, the urn had been taken.
Mrs Ryder appealed for the "lowlife" who took his ashes to return them.
"I don't want to think of him dumped somewhere. We just want him back please."
Mrs Ryder said she couldn't believe it when they returned from the restaurant and saw the car window had been smashed.
The theft had left the family "devastated" and she has been crying ever since, she said.
"It was just awful. We were gutted. We've no closure."
Mrs Ryder said family members including his son and daughter had gone  for a meal at Toby Carvery on Aigburth Road while they waited for the high tide at 15:00 BST.
The container holding the ashes of Mr Ryder, who was a carpenter, was taken along with presents for her grandchildren.
Mrs Ryder pleaded with the thief to return the container which she said may have been mistaken for a whisky presentation box.
Funeral director Stephen Johnstone from Saltney, Chester said anyone with information can call him "in confidence" with a location.
Merseyside Police believe the items were stolen from a parked blue Nissan Qashqai between 13:30 and 15:00.
The force asked the offender to "search their conscience" and return them.
