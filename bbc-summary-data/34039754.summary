Newsquest cuts 20 jobs at The Herald and Evening Times

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Up to 20 editorial jobs are to be cut at the Glasgow-based newspapers, The Herald and Evening Times.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The papers' owner, Newsquest, said savings were needed to safeguard the business amid a period of "substantial weakness" in advertising revenue.
It said it regretted the action and had begun a voluntary redundancy programme.
The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said this was the third round of job cuts at the titles this year and called for Newsquest to change its strategy.
In a statement, Newsquest said that The Herald and Times Group was "making savings in its editorial department following substantial weakness in newspaper advertising revenue and anticipating continued income challenges ahead".
The statement said: "The company continues to make good digital progress but has to contain costs to ensure the long-term success of the business.
"The company has advised staff that some 18 to 20 roles are affected and has opened a voluntary redundancy programme."
Newsquest said it regretted the move but it was needed.
The company said it was determined to maintain the most competitive editorial operation it can based on a cost base it can sustain.
NUJ national organiser Paul Holleran described the job losses as "unacceptable" and said a change in management strategy was needed.
"This is the third round of job cuts in the last year in The Herald and Evening Times," he said.
"It is not sustainable to meet budgets and maintain newspapers by constant cuts and savings.
"Other groups have grown profits in recent years by investment and using basic methods of running newspapers and Newsquest needs to change direction as the current route is all downhill."
He added: "The scale and frequency of job losses is unacceptable."
