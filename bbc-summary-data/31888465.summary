Why Pi Day doesn't work in the UK but does in the US

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Saturday is the day when a love of maths and making pies comes full circle.

It's Pi Day, a once-a-century calendar date, but one which only works if you use the American way of writing dates out.
In the US the month and day are round the other way - so Saturday is 3-14-15 and so are the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653.
The next time that happens in that way will be in March 2115.
But in the UK we write down dates with the day first, so Saturday is 14-3-15 and Pi Day doesn't work.
But hey - who are we to burst the #PiDay bubble.
For everyone else, University of California mathematician Edward Frenkel explains why they're celebrating.
"It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics," he says. "Pi is special."
Pi, if you were wondering, is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics.
Welshman William Jones became the first person to use the Greek letter Ï€ to represent Pi in 1706.
And it is a basic atomic building block for maths, according to Temple University mathematician John Paulos in America.
In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie.
"It's a real exciting moment for maths enthusiasm," said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University maths professor.
He's called it a time for people to "remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school".
One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns.
"We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time," said Frenkel.
"How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?"
