Police Scotland said it received calls describing an explosion while images posted on social media showed the wall and roof of the first-floor flat largely destroyed.
One man is being treated for burns and another suffered smoke inhalation.
Police and the fire service are investigating the cause of the fire and some nearby properties have been evacuated while gas mains in the area are checked.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: "Emergency services remain at the scene and a joint investigation with police and the fire service is to be carried out.
"West Dunbartonshire Council has set up a rest centre for those evacuated from their homes."
