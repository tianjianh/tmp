The Open 2016: Jordan Spieth says criticism of his performances this year is unfair

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Jordan Spieth feels he is being unfairly criticised after failing to replicate his successes of 2015.

The American, 22, won the Masters and US Open, missed out by one shot on a play-off at The Open and finished second in the US PGA Championship.
Spieth has won twice in 2016 but blew a five-shot lead at the Masters in April.
"Most of the questions are comparing to last year and that's unfair because that's happened less than a dozen times to anybody in golf," he said.
"I would appreciate if people would look at the positives over comparing to maybe what would hopefully happen to me a few times in my career, a year like last year.
"So it seems a bit unfair, at 22, to be expecting something like that all the time."
Spieth made four birdies in the first seven holes at The Open on Saturday but dropped five strokes in seven holes as he finished five over for the tournament after three rounds.
