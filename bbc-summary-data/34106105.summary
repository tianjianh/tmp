Usually over 12 months the team would expect to be deployed on 70 to 100 occasions.
The 100th call-out came on Friday when the team went to the aid of a walker with a dislocated shoulder on the West Highland Way.
Lochaber MRT went on to deal with two more incidents over the weekend, one an overdue hillwalker.
Members of the rescue team resumed their search on Monday morning for the man who had failed to return from a walk up Ben Nevis on Sunday.
The search was stood down when he turned up at a campsite.
