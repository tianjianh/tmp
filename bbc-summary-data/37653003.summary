Racist remarks claims 'false', says Dame Lowell Goddard

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The former head of the child sexual abuse inquiry has strenuously denied a newspaper report of allegations of misconduct and racism made against her.

Dame Lowell Goddard is alleged to have said Britain had so many paedophiles "because it has so many Asian men", according to a report in the Times.
The senior New Zealand judge has hit back at the claims, calling them "false" and "malicious".
The Home Office said it had received no formal complaint about Dame Lowell.
She resigned as head of the inquiry on 4 August, after 18 months in the role.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is investigating the extent to which institutions in England and Wales have failed to protect children from sexual abuse.
The Times also reported allegations that Dame Lowell had expressed shock at the size of the UK's ethnic minority population and mentioned having to travel 50 miles from London to see a white face.
The paper said senior Home Office staff and advisers knew about the alleged derogatory comments and other complaints.
Dame Lowell said: "I confirm my absolute rejection of this attack. I am confident that in New Zealand my known reputation from my work over many years will provide its own refutation of these falsities."
In a detailed statement issued later, she added: "The specific allegations of racially derogatory remarks are totally false. I categorically never said that 'Britain has so many paedophiles because it has so many Asian men'.
"I never expressed shock at the number of ethnic people in Britain. I have never held the views and opinions attributed to me, nor is the language in these allegations vocabulary which I either used or would consider using."
Dame Lowell said any suggestion that she "threatened at any time 'to take this inquiry down with me'" was "totally untrue". She also rejected claims of being rude and abusive to staff.
Andrew Norfolk, chief investigative reporter at the Times, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the sources for the story were "several people who are at a senior level and have a detailed awareness of what has been going on within the headquarters of that inquiry".
"These people, over many months, were thinking 'what can we do about this? This judge is seriously impacting on the work of the inquiry,'" he said.
"They forwarded those concerns to a place they thought was a fit place for them, the Home Office, and Theresa May had the power to terminate her contract. The frustration intensified as nothing was done."
The Home Office said it had been "made aware of concerns about the professionalism and competence of Justice Goddard" on 29 July, six days before she was to resign.
"The permanent secretary advised the inquiry that as they were independent they should raise this directly with the chair," its statement said.
"It is understood that they did this. No formal complaint was made to the Home Office."
Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mrs May and her former department had "serious questions to answer" over "suggestions that Home Office officials turned a blind eye to allegations of impropriety".
"How can the victims expect this inquiry to uncover child abuse when it has faced multiple setbacks of its own?
"After years of waiting for justice, they deserve better. It is crucial that this inquiry gets on with its vital task."
Labour MP for Streatham Chuka Umunna, some of whose constituents are among the abuse victims, said concerns about the scale of the inquiry could be addressed by giving it a "federal" structure, with a national body overseeing the work of several smaller investigations.
"That's the way to change the scale of the inquiry, but to change the scope would very much worry the survivors," he said.
Peter Saunders, a member of the Victims and Survivors' Consultative Panel, which forms part of the inquiry, said the accusations reported by the Times were not behaviour he "recognised" with Dame Lowell and he worried about the effect the claims would have.
"[The inquiry] has had far too many setbacks, far too many people sniping at it," he told Today. "There are people out there listening to this programme who most definitely want this inquiry to fail.
"It has evolved a lot in the last few weeks. It has turned a big corner and there is a determination."
Norfolk said: "I know for certain that the people who have been speaking to me and my colleague only have an interest in ending the deep frustration of people, men and women, who for years, for decades, have been waiting for the institutions that turned a blind eye to their abuse to be held to account.
"I think what really compounds all of this is the sense that an inquiry set up to oppose a culture of secrecy and cover-up has become itself an exemplar of the sins it was supposed to expose."
