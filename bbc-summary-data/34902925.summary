Bedfordshire policing cuts 'may hamper counter-terrorism work'

Further cuts to community police in Bedfordshire could hamper the flow of intelligence to security agencies, the police and crime commissioner claims.

Olly Martins has issued a statement in advance of the government spending review later this week.
Bedfordshire had a high concentration of potential extremists, he said.
"Neighbourhood police underpin counter-terrorism strategy because they can pick up local intelligence about radicalisation and plots," he said.
"If this local intelligence is not passed on, national agencies are not going to be able to deal with threats."
The Home Office declined to comment ahead of the spending review.
But, Chancellor George Osborne refused to rule out cuts to the number of frontline police officers in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, from the UK government's Counter-Terrorism Policing Network, has called on members of the public to provide "information needed to defeat terrorism", Mr Martins said.
Mr Basu described information-gathering at street level as a "lifeline".
"The level of the threat is complex and ranges from lone attackers intent on carrying out crude, simplistic and violent attacks to sophisticated networks," he said.
"There is now an increased desire among these terrorists to spread terror by attacking civilians at their most unguarded moments."
Mr Martins said Bedfordshire had one of the lowest ratio of police officers to population in England and was regarded as a rural force, but its crime statistics reflected a largely urban character.
Further cuts would make intelligence-gathering at neighbourhood level on the scale needed "inadequate".
An online petition he has raised on the government website has already attracted 10,000 signatures, which will secure a written answer from the government.
However, 100,000 signatures are needed to trigger a parliamentary debate, his main objective.
During his interview with Andrew Marr, Mr Osborne said the counter-terrorism budget was being increased and more money would be spent on defence.
