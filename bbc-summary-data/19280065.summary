[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The park will form part of the North Bay Sands development and could be open by late 2013.
The scheme had been put on hold by developers Benchmark Leisure in 2009 due to the economic downturn.
Borough councillors approved the plan on Thursday. The complex will also feature a family restaurant, 29 holiday lodges and 124 holiday homes.
The Conservative-controlled council's planning committee was told the scheme should become a focal point for tourism and leisure for the town.
The water park will include indoor and outdoor swimming pools, water rides and flumes, a spa, changing facilities and a car park.
The developers said the park could attract up to 300,000 visitors a year.
