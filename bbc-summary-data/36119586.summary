[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Emergency services were called by a passer-by at 10:33 BST to rescue the man from the water behind the ASDA supermarket.
Devon and Cornwall Police said they believed the man had fallen into the river.
A member of the public kept the man's head out of the water until the emergency services arrived.
A spokesman for the police said the man had been in the water for 40 minutes before specialist crews were able to rescue him.
He was then taken to Torbay Hospital for treatment.
Police are investigating how the man came to fall into the river to "rule out any foul play".
