[SN]TITLE[SN]
Brentford 0-0 Norwich City

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Brentford and 10-man Norwich played out a disappointing goalless draw in the final Championship match of 2016.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Canaries striker Cameron Jerome should have scored after the break but scuffed his shot over while unmarked.
Norwich substitute Jacob Murphy also saw a low effort well saved by Bees goalkeeper Dan Bentley at Griffin Park.
The visitors had to play the final 15 minutes a man down after Robbie Brady was controversially sent off for a sliding tackle on Ryan Woods.
Republic of Ireland international Brady seemed to go in for a 50-50 challenge with the Bees midfielder, but was shown a straight red after catching Woods on the leg.
Brentford, and 13-goal top scorer Scott Hogan, mustered little threat in front of goal until Norwich were reduced to 10 men and failed to register a shot on target throughout.
Striker Hogan appeared to be clean through in the 90th minute but was denied by a superbly-timed tackle by Ryan Bennett.
Norwich, who were second in the table in mid-October, have now only won twice in 12 Championship games and end the year in 12th, while Brentford stay 15th.
Brentford manager Dean Smith:
"I'd like to have seen us pose more of a threat in the final third, but the two sides cancelled each other out pretty much all game.
"They had the better of the chances but apart from that there wasn't a great deal in it. The clean sheet is a positive and I felt we were tough to beat, but we definitely need to create more than we did."
Norwich boss Alex Neil:
"Robbie [Brady] clearly isn't going in to injure the lad and both of them are sliding at impact, but we're not getting the rub of the green right now and that's just another example.
"But you can't feel sorry for yourself, you just need to roll your sleeves up and keep going. The one thing about football is you've always got a chance to make it better."
