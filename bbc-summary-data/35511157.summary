"They were on a good run of games - 13 unbeaten - so we knew it was going to be a tough match, but I thought the boys dug in today and showed quality when needed and fully deserved the win.
"The way Cheltenham are playing as well, we need to keep winning games.
"We've had two really good runs during the course of the season and we want to keep it going."
