Thomas, 29, and Martin, 26, join on free transfers after leaving Birmingham City and Coventry City respectively.
Both players have signed two-year contracts at the club, who finished second in League Two last term.
Ex-Bournemouth striker Thomas worked under U's manager Michael Appleton in spells at Blackpool and Portsmouth.
"Knowing a manager and knowing that he knows me as a player sort of made up my mind," Thomas told BBC Radio Oxford.
Ex-Southampton centre-back Martin added: "It ticked a lot of boxes for me, especially with the way the club is going.
"Looking at Burton Albion last year, it goes to show exactly what a club like this can do and there's no reason why we also cannot go up again."
Appleton made former Blackburn goalkeeper Simon Eastwood his first summer signing on Thursday.
