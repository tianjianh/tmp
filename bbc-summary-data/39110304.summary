Robin McGreer, 35, allegedly approached the victim, verbally harassed him and left him with a "significant face wound" in the 27 November 2016 attack.
He is charged with bias-related malicious bodily injury in relation to the incident in a Washington DC suburb.
The victim was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
The accused, who was arrested on Monday, allegedly left the scene at the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia before police arrived.
Fairfax County Police have not identified the 31-year-old victim or his race and religion, citing privacy concerns.
Hate crime watchdog groups say such bias-related attacks are on the rise in the US.
Last week two Indian men were shot in a bar in Kansas City by a patron who reportedly shouted "get out of my country" before opening fire on them.
