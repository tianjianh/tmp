The Mexican government said almost 100 raids had been carried out in 12 countries.
Three girls aged between nine and 15 were rescued in Mexico, a government commission said in a statement.
Computers were seized that were allegedly used to post indecent videos on the internet.
The Mexican National Security Commission said searches were carried out in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Spain, the United States, Uruguay and Venezuela.
"Operation Without Borders" was aimed at "breaking various structures dedicated to the distribution of pornographic material of children via the internet", the commission said in a statement.
A fourth girl was rescued as part of the operation but the commission did not specify in which country.
The raids come two months after Spanish police arrested more than 80 people in raids targeting images of child sex abuse.
