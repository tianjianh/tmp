[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The funeral of Labour MP Jo Cox will take place in her constituency on Friday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Batley and Spen MP, 41, was shot and stabbed shortly before she was due to hold a constituency surgery in Birstall, West Yorkshire on 16 June.
Her death prompted memorial events around the world to mark what would have been her 42nd birthday.
The cortege will stop at two locations to allow members of the public to pay their respects.
In a statement, her family said they were "overwhelmed and touched" by the support they have received since her death.
They said: "Now, particularly for the children, we have decided that Jo's funeral will be a very small and private family affair.
"Anybody from the local community who would like to pay their respects is welcome to gather along the areas outlined as we make this last journey."
The location of the funeral has not been publicised.
Mrs Cox, a mother of two, had been an MP for just over a year when she was attacked outside Birstall Library.
A fundraising appeal to raise money for causes she had supported has raised more than Â£1.48m in donations.
An inquest into her death was opened and adjourned last month after hearing she died from multiple stab and gunshot wounds.
Thomas Mair, 52, from Birstall, faces charges of murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the attack on Mrs Cox.
