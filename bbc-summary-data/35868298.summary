The rule also applies to Coleman so Sky Sports presenter Charlotte Coleman will also not be allowed into their camp.
"There will be no family, no girlfriends, no wives in our hotel in the first period of the group stage," said Coleman.
"We have three games in 10 days and there's no time."
Wales, who will be at their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup, play group matches against Slovakia, England and Russia.
Coleman said there was a six-day period after the group stages when players can "spend some time with the family".
"We have been desperate to get to a camp," added Coleman as his side prepared for two warm-up friendlies, facing Northern Ireland on Thursday in Cardiff, before a trip to Ukraine four days later.
"If one of the players say they have a bit of cabin fever, then good. We have waited long enough. We are out there to make sure we do Wales proud and to do that we have to prepare properly."
"When you are in the hotel it is us and that's it. It's a small sacrifice."
Coleman will also forego celebrating his 46th birthday on the eve of their opening match against Slovakia, which takes place on 11 June
"My birthday won't happen," said the former Fulham, Real Sociedad and Coventry boss. "I won't be thinking about anything else other than our game."
