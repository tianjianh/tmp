The 14 volunteers from the Glasgow Ahlulbayt Association set off on Friday.
They had packed a van with blankets, sleeping bags, medicine and warm clothing.
Speaking after their arrival on Saturday morning, group leader Azzam Mohammad told BBC Scotland conditions at the camp were very tough.
"It is absolutely bad," he said.
"The people don't even have shoes. They don't even have blankets. There are three or four of them getting covered by one blanket.
"We are trying to give them as much as we can. We have jackets, we have some shoes, we have gloves, we have sleeping bags. But really the need if far, far more than what we have got here."
The team from Glasgow includes two doctors, who will provide health care to the migrants in northern France.
Before setting off, the volunteers said they have been "overwhelmed" by the generosity of the public in giving to their appeal.
Dr Sonia Allam is a consultant anaesthetist who works in Forth Valley. She is returning for a second time to the camp.
She said: "Last time we had only limited equipment and supplies.
"This time we've had a chance to understand what their needs are and be able to collect more appropriate medication and so on."
Another volunteer who has been to the camp before is Mary Macleod.
"They are camping in fields," she said.
"It's muddy, it's winter. Would you take your family camping right now, even for one night? The refugees are living there."
