Dutchman Mac-Intisch, 26, from SC Cambuur, Pereira, 24, from Epernay Champagne and de Freitas, 22, from Monaco, have all signed two-year deals.
New Vale boss Bruno Ribeiro has now made five signings inside three days.
Defender Kjell Knops was followed in by striker Rigino Cicilia from Roda JC.
Pereira began his career on the books at French top-flight side Socheaux before moving to Reims in 2012.
De Freitas started out at Monaco before making his professional debut while on loan at Portuguese second division club Varzim in January 2016.
Frenchmen Pereira and De Freitas have options for a further 12 months on their deals.
Amsterdam-born Mac-Intisch, the second Dutch defender to arrive in Burslem following Knops, came through the youth system at Ajax before getting his chance at Dutch second-tier sides Haarlem and Telstar.
Bruno Ribeiro has been working hard on strengthening his depleted squad since taking over on 20 June.
After a number of players opted not to renew their deals on reduced terms, Ribeiro was faced with having only 10 contracted players for 2016-17 season.
But his recruitment drive has helped ease the situation, BBC Radio Stoke having reported that the Portuguese boss is set to announce more new arrivals over the next few days.
