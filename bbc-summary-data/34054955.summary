Ex-MP Harvey Proctor denies child abuse claims

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
A former MP has said he is "completely innocent" of claims of child abuse and murder, a day after being questioned by police for a second time.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Harvey Proctor said the claims had "wrecked" his life and called for senior police officers to resign.
He was interviewed under caution as part of Operation Midland, an inquiry into claims powerful men abused children in the 1970s and 1980s.
He called the Metropolitan Police inquiry a "homosexual witch hunt".
"I'm a homosexual. I'm not a murderer or a paedophile," said Mr Proctor.
He held a press conference to address the issue, saying he wanted to end the "drip, drip, drip" of information in the media.
Mr Proctor, Conservative MP for Billericay until 1987, said he met officers from the Metropolitan Police voluntarily on Monday, following a similar interview in June.
The Met said it would not be commenting following Mr Proctor's press conference.
During the conference in central London, Mr Proctor said he believed all the claims against him came from one complainant - protected by legal anonymity and known only as "Nick".
The former MP said:
Mr Proctor added: "I should be arrested, charged and prosecuted for murder and these awful crimes immediately so I can start the process of ridiculing these preposterous allegations in open court - or 'Nick' should be stripped of his anonymity and prosecuted for wasting police time and money, making the most foul of false allegations and seeking to pervert the course of justice."
He also said that "Nick" should be "medically examined to ensure he is of sound mind".
Mr Proctor said police had asked him if he knew his "eight alleged co-conspirators".
He said this alleged "gang" contained people he knew, as well as people he had heard of and people he did not know.
"None of the allegations were alleged to have taken place at my home, and I have not visited the homes of any of the 'gang'," he said.
Mr Proctor said the list of names included those of former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, former chief of the defence staff Lord Bramall and former Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath.
He said he and Sir Edward "despised" each other and that he had never been to Sir Edward's home - which he pointed out would have had CCTV and numerous security and household staff.
"It is so far-fetched as to be unbelievable. It is unbelievable because it is not true," he said.
"My situation has transformed from Kafkaesque bewilderment to black farce incredulity."
