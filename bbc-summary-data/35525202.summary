Fiorentina 2-1 Inter Milan

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Fiorentina went third in Serie A thanks to Khouma Babacar's injury-time winner against Inter Milan in a match with three late red cards.

The Senegalese striker, brought on for the final three minutes, bundled in after keeper Samir Handanovic fumbled.
Marcelo Brozovic gave Inter a half-time lead, but Borja Valero made it 1-1.
Inter's Alex Telles and Geoffrey Kondogbia were both sent off, with Babacar's winner and a red card for Fiorentina's Mauro Zarate in between.
Full-back Telles, booked in the opening minutes, was perhaps unlucky to see a second yellow card with eight minutes left when he was judged to have brought down Federico Bernardeschi.
Zarate, whose introduction as a second-half substitute had sparked Fiorentina's comeback, could have little complaint, though, as he was dismissed seconds after the winning goal for grabbing Jeison Murillo around the neck in an off-the-ball incident.
Midfielder Kondogbia was sent off after the final whistle for dissent, with television footage showing him applauding referee Paolo Mazzoleni sarcastically.
Victory extended Fiorentina's unbeaten Serie A run to five matches as they moved above Roma into the third and final Champions League qualification spot.
They dominated the opening 25 minutes - with only a brilliant Telles clearance denying Josip Ilicic an opening goal - but were deflated when Brozovic finished a brilliant Inter counter-attack by firing Rodrigo Palacio's cross high into the net.
Valero headed Fiorentina level from Ilicic's deflected cross after an hour, and the home side had the better of the match after that; coming out on top in a crazy finale as Inter suffered a defeat that leaves them in fifth place.
