Company Sgt Maj Nelson Carter, 29, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his bravery in the Battle of the Boar's Head, in which he died on 30 June 1916.
A memorial paving stone was unveiled in Eastbourne Pavilion Gardens and at the war memorial in Hailsham High Street.
He was educated in Hailsham but lived most of his life in Eastbourne.
He was survived by his daughter and wife, who accepted the Victoria Cross on his behalf from King George V.
Councillor Pat Hearn, the mayor of Eastbourne, said: "Nelson Carter was a true hero who showed incredible bravery in leading his men under intense fire.
"It's very fitting that we honour his memory almost 100 years to the day since his death and that his family and the people of Eastbourne will have the chance to remember him and the sacrifices he made."
A plaque commemorating his life can be found on his home at 33 Greys Road, Old Town in Eastbourne.
Hailsham mayor, Councillor Nigel Coltman, added that the town was proud to commemorate his "heroic actions and the commemorative stone will provide an enduring legacy for him".
