Mr Prescott had been on the campaign trail in Rhyl, Denbighshire, before the 2001 general election when the incident with a demonstrator occurred.
The plaque has a Quick Response (QR) code which allows the public to read about the incident on their smartphone.
Other plaques in Rhyl with QR codes include the town's oldest house.
When scanned with a smart phone or tablet, the QR codes download a concise account from the HistoryPoints website.
Mr Prescott had been walking towards the entrance of Rhyl's Little Theatre to speak at a Labour rally when the incident happened.
It was filmed and photographed by the media who were covering the event.
Ruth Pritchard, of Rhyl History Club, who has contributed information about many of the locations in Rhyl which HistoryPoints has featured, said: "The incident when John Prescott visited Rhyl in 2001 has passed into local folklore.
"I find it fascinating that a QR code can show people where it all happened and tell the story on the spot.
"These codes are helping to illustrate Rhyl's wonderful, colourful history from the recent as well as distant past."
