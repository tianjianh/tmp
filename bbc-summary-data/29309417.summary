Microsoft has cancelled this month's Chinese launch of the Xbox One, two days before it was due to take place.

The console was due to be formally launched and go on sale in China on 23 September.
So far, Microsoft has not given any reason for the cancellation or given a date for when the launch will go ahead.
Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are gearing up to enter the Chinese market after a 14-year ban on foreign consoles was lifted in January.
"Despite strong and steady progress, we are going to need a bit more time to deliver the best experiences possible for our fans in China," said Microsoft in a statement given to games industry news site CVG. It said the launch would take place before the end of 2014.
People who pre-ordered the console and were expecting to receive it this week would get an "added bonus" said Microsoft's general manager in China Enwei Xie.
When it goes on sale the console is expected to cost 3,699 yuan (Â£370, $600) without the Kinect motion detector, and 4,299 yuan with it. Launch titles were expected to include Forza Motorsport 5, Zoo Tycoon and Max: The Curse of Brotherhood.
The delay comes as Microsoft is being investigated by Chinese authorities who have accused it of violating its anti-trust laws.
The delay might mean that Sony is the first to launch a console in the country though it too has yet to name a launch date for its PlayStation 4.
When China lifted its ban, it said anyone wishing to sell consoles in the country had to team up with a local manufacturer to make the gadgets locally. Microsoft signed up with BesTV, and Sony struck a deal with Shanghai Oriental Pearl.
