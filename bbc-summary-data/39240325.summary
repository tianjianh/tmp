[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
Guiseley, looking for their fourth straight win, had to dig in early on with two clearances on the line as the hosts flew out of the blocks.
Boreham Wood continued to press, but a combination of Femi Ilesanmi missing a glorious chance and great work from goalkeeper Jonathan Maxted kept it 0-0 at the break.
The visitors came into the contest more in the second half but both sides struggled in front of goal as Boreham Wood drew 0-0 for the third time in four games.
