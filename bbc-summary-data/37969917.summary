[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The former US Open champion from Portrush finished the Playa del Carmen event in joint 24th after a round which included six birdies and three bogies.
Waterford's Seamus Power started the day in fourth place but slipped down the field after a disappointing 76 left him on 10 under.
American Pat Perez won by two shots on 21 under.
McDowell was five under for his round before falling back with dropped shots on 16 and 18.
He has five top-10 finishes in 2016 but some poor results this year have seen him fall to 81 in the world rankings.
