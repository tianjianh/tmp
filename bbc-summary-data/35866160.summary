Teachers in West Dunbartonshire to resume strike action

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Secondary teachers in West Dunbartonshire are to resume strike action amid an ongoing dispute about cuts to principal teacher posts.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) suspended a third set of strikes earlier this month to ballot members on a revised offer from the council.
Strikes are to resume in March and April after members rejected the offer.
The council urged the EIS "to reconsider the significant compromise that has been offered".
The EIS said that unless a deal could be agreed its members would stage strike action on 30 and 31 March and 26 and 27 April.
EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan said: "The EIS has written to West Dunbartonshire Council today, advising that the industrial action campaign has been reinstated.
"We remain open to further dialogue in the hope of agreeing a resolution to the dispute, and would urge the council administration to rethink their latest proposal in order to better address legitimate concerns over the educational impact of their plans."
The union said its members had voted two-to-one against the revised proposal from the council on a turnout of 88%.
A spokeswoman for West Dunbartonshire Council said: "Following months of negotiations, proposals were jointly developed with the EIS to address all of the points the union raised in relation to the new management structure.
"We believed this compromise, which would have introduced an additional 18 principal teachers and two centrally-deployed staff, would bring the dispute to a positive end for the benefit of our young people, parents and staff.
"Around 50% of our secondary school teachers do not want to strike. We urge the EIS to reconsider the significant compromise that has been offered."
The row centres on moves to cut the number of principal teachers of individual subjects.
Instead there would be so-called "faculty heads", whose roles would cover a number of subjects.
For instance, a school might have one "head of humanities" in charge of subjects such as English and modern languages.
In January and February, all five main secondary schools in West Dunbartonshire were closed for a day after EIS teachers went on their first strike since the 1980s.
