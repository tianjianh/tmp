Gordon Brown urges halt to tax credits cuts 'mistake'

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Gordon Brown is urging the government to abandon cuts to tax credits completely, warning that to press on would lead to "one of the biggest poverty problems in the western world".

In a speech, the ex-prime minister will defend the large increase in tax credits he presided over as chancellor.
To cut them now by £4.4bn would hurt the working poor and "undermine everything Britain stands for".
George Osborne is to announce revised proposals later this month.
The chancellor argues the bill for tax credits, an income supplement paid to millions of families - many of which are in work but on low incomes - ballooned by billions under the last Labour government and the government says it needs to be brought under control as part of £12bn overall cuts to welfare.
It is one of a series of measures the government has taken since Labour left office to, as David Cameron puts it, "sort out the mess" of the huge deficit left by Mr Brown's government.
But Mr Osborne is facing growing calls to change tack following a defeat in the House of Lords and amid concerns that plans to lower the threshold at which people can start to claim working tax credits from £6,420 to £3,850 a year in April will leave working families on average £1,300 worse off.
In a report published on Tuesday, the cross-party work and pensions committee urged Mr Osborne to postpone reforms for a year to enable debate about the future of working-age benefits.
And in his first major intervention in domestic politics since the general election, Mr Brown is to take issue with the government and defend the legacy of his decade as chancellor, which saw a huge expansion of tax credits between 1997 and 2007.
Writing in the Daily Mirror ahead of the speech to the Child Poverty Action Group, Mr Brown said only a full U-turn from the government would be enough, urging Mr Osborne "not to take it out on the family, and the children".
Tax credits are a series of benefits introduced by the last Labour government to help low-paid families. There are two types: Working Tax Credit (WTC) for those in work, and Child Tax Credit (CTC) for those with children.
Under the government's existing proposals, the income threshold for Working Tax Credits - £6,420 - would be cut to £3,850 a year from April.
In other words, as soon as someone earned £3,850, they would see their payments reduced. The income threshold for those only claiming CTCs would be cut from £16,105 to £12,125.
The rate at which those payments are cut would also get faster. Currently, for every £1 claimants earn above the threshold, they lose 41p. This is known as the taper rate. But from April, the taper rate would accelerate to 48p.
There would be similar reductions for those who claim work allowances under the new Universal Credit.
Tax credits, pensions and the generation game
Who will be the winners and losers?
A high-stakes battle
The cuts, he said, would undermine "everything Britain stands for: hard work, independence of spirit, savings and compassion for children" and worsen "staggering" projections for poverty.
Rejecting ministers' arguments that the losses would be offset by measures such as a new £9-an-hour national living wage, he said it would need to be £12 an hour to compensate two-child families and £14 for those with three.
"No phasing in, no temporary halt or slower pacing of the implementation of the Osborne tax credit proposals will make a fundamental attack on the working poor and on children much fairer," he wrote.
"Why? Because the reforms arise from wrong assumptions - that we have a Britain divided between strivers and skivers."
Mr Brown said none of the alternatives to tax credits mooted by the Conservatives and other parties, such as raising personal income tax allowances or introducing a so-called citizens income, would cost less or be as effective in helping poor children in working families.
The government, he claimed, should be focusing on the "lack of good paying jobs in advanced economies such as ours" rather than penalising what he described as "the new poor", a generation of twenty-somethings struggling to get by.
"Britain is about to have one of the biggest poverty problems in the western world and it is government-induced poverty stemming from the Conservatives," he wrote.
"And so if the current or pending proposals penalise work and penalise families and children - and are against everything Britain stands for - it's not enough to massage them with a few amendments.
"They are a mistake, root and branch, and in the interests of Britain's hard working families and their children the Autumn Statement on November 25 has to see them abandoned once and for all."
Former Conservative Sir John Major has also joined the debate on how to tackle entrenched poverty and disparities in life chances by warning that levels of income inequality in Britain are "shocking".
In a speech on Tuesday, Sir John warned that some UK communities were "among the poorest in all Northern Europe".
While poverty would not be ended "by benefits alone", ministers "must understand how hard it is to escape from such circumstances" and have an "equal concentration on those who are failed by the system" as those who cheat it.
