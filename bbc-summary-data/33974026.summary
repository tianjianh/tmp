[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
An inquest into the death of a Cardiff woman on holiday in south-east Asia should be completed within three months, a pre-inquest review has heard.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
BBC Wales picture editor Johanna Powell, 37, died in Laos on 11 April.
She was on holiday with friends when the cruise boat they were on capsized on the Mekong River near Pak Beng.
On Tuesday at Aberdare Coroner's Court, Coroner Andrew Barkley said he had not received a final report from overseas so was not in a position to proceed.
He asked Ms Powell's family if they would prefer to wait for the conclusion of investigations abroad, which he warned could take years, or go ahead with an inquest based on statements to be obtained from the European witnesses involved.
Ms Powell's parents Teresa and Donald indicated that they would prefer the latter.
