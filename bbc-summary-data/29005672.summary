Adam Nash, 35, told the Huddersfield Daily Examiner his son Isaac had been in the water with brother Xander, 10.
Mr Nash saved Xander from the waves but his father Paul - Isaac's grandfather - had been unable to hold on to Isaac.
The search for Isaac continues, after the incident at Aberffraw on Friday afternoon.
Father-of-three Mr Nash, from the Huddersfield area, said the family were on holiday and as they had been to Aberffraw "many times before" were familiar with the area.
He said the two boys found walking along the beach "boring" and "stripped off and ran into the sea".
He said he "told them not to go too far," and although the waves were big he believed it was "perfectly safe".
Shortly after, the brothers got into difficulty.
Mr Nash said: "My dad had been waving at them and shouting but they couldn't hear him. He got a little bit concerned and stripped off.
"He swam out to where they both were near the rocks. As he swam towards them Isaac was shouting. He knew he was in trouble.
"He was getting closer to the rocks. When I saw that my dad had got to Isaac I realised that they were having trouble. Everything got loud and there was spray coming off the sea. I could sense they were panicking."
While his father tried to help Isaac, Mr Nash headed for his younger son, Xander.
"I got hold of him about three times to get him back," he said. "He was grabbing me round the neck. He said he couldn't swim anymore. I was exhausted too. I was having problems myself let alone supporting him. I thought I just don't want to let go of him.
"Fortunately some white water was hitting us, and I thought it might help us travel back to shore despite the massive waves.
"When I got my feet on the ground I was massively relieved. Xander said to me: 'I thought I was going to die.'
"As soon as I got my feet down I turned round and looked for my dad. He was washed up on to the rocks and just laid flat."
Mr Nash continued: "My dad came round and his face was just screwed up and there was blood dripping down him from his arms and legs. And he said: 'I couldn't save him, I couldn't save him'."
He told how the pair were hit by a "massive wave" and Isaac's grandfather was unable to hold on to him.
He and other members of the family were taken to hospital in Bangor but later returned to search for Isaac.
On Monday, police and coastguards were spending a fourth day searching.
North Wales Police have confirmed the search for 12 year old Isaac Nash from Huddersfield continued this morning, Monday 1st September 2014.
Ch Insp Simon Barrasford said: "This morning the joint emergency service response resumed with a helicopter from North Wales Police joining HM Coastguard in an area around the west coast of Anglesey. Specialist Police divers and land borne colleagues are also conducting searches particularly during low tide."
