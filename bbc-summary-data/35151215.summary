It was taken from Lloyds Bank in High Street, Cleobury Mortimer, during the early hours.
A JCB was thought to have been used in the incident as one was found abandoned nearby.
An eyewitness said he saw what he described as a "cherry picker" being driven by a masked man and rang 999.
The vehicle was believed to have been reported stolen, a spokesman for West Mercia Police said.
