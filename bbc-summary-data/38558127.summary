Mansfield Town manager Steve Evans says the club will continue to bolster their squad in the transfer window.

The Stags have already made four signings since the start of January.
Evans told BBC Radio Nottingham: "We're hopeful (this week), but there'll certainly be more signings in the transfer window.
"Even the chairman was getting withdrawal symptoms, he was on the phone to me asking if we'd signed anyone. There's one or two close."
The Stags have already signed striker Yoann Arquin and midfielder Joel Byrom, while goalkeeper Jake Kean and midfielder Ben Whiteman have joined on loan.
Arquin and Whiteman scored in Saturday's 3-0 victory over Crewe Alexandra, which saw Mansfield move up to 14th in League Two, just six points adrift of the play-off places.
"They (further signings) may not be in for Tuesday, but certainly before we go to Notts County on Saturday," continued 54-year-old former Rotherham and Leeds boss Evans.
"For me personally, I would be disappointed if we have not got one of two additions to the group. That's what we are trying to do as we have a great group."
