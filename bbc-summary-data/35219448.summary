Connor Williams, 17, and Conor Tiley, 18, both from the Aberbargoed area, died on Sunday.
The car they were travelling in on New Road, Tir-y-Berth, Hengoed, crashed just before 19:30 GMT.
Connor Williams' parents said he was "our breath, our happiness, our life", while Conor Tiley's family said he was loved by all who knew him.
"His big smile would always light up any room," they added.
"He will be sadly missed, but will never be forgotten and will always be in our hearts and memories."
A statement from Connor Williams' family read: "One of the best things in the world isn't things, it's every moment that we were blessed to be with our son.
"He was our breath, our happiness, our life."
The boys were sixth form pupils at Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, a Welsh language high school in Caerphilly.
Head teacher Owain ap Dafydd said the "popular, pleasant and decent pupils" would be "sorely missed".
Mr ap Dafydd said: "Both Conor Tiley and Connor Williams were popular, pleasant, decent pupils at Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni.
"Conor Tiley was in the final year of his studies and had plans to study business at university. Quite the entrepreneur, he worked as a local DJ and loved music.
"Connor Williams completed his studies with us at the end of last year, and he will always be remembered as a happy boy, with a good sense of humour, who was a great friend to many.
"Both will be sorely missed by all at the school and in the wider community. We send our deepest condolences to both families at this most difficult and painful time.
Cameron Nicholas , 18, who was also travelling with the teenagers is being treated at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales with serious injuries.
Gwent Police said all three were travelling in a dark purple Ford Fiesta.
They collided with a silver Vauxhall Astra, but the driver of that car was not seriously hurt.
Anyone with information has been asked to contact police on 101.
