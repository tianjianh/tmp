The 34-year-old Argentina international made 246 appearances for Tigers, winning four Premiership titles.
He played his last game in November against Harlequins and has been advised to retire because of a back injury.
"I have been extremely proud to represent Leicester and Argentina for so many seasons," Ayerza said.
"I'll miss a lot but it is time to face new challenges in my life, turn over the page, as hard as that is, and I wish the Tigers all the very best for the future."
Ayerza, who played 66 Test matches for Argentina, joined Leicester from his home country in the summer of 2006.
He appeared in three World Cups and helped the Pumas to third place at his first tournament in 2007.
In 2015, Ayerza played for both teams during a testimonial match between Leicester and Argentina.
Tigers chairman Peter Tom added: "Marcos has had the respect of team-mates and rivals around the rugby world, as well as from the pundits and journalists who follow the game closely.
"He has been without doubt one of the leading players in his position in the world game."
