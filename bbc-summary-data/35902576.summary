The vital goal came after St Johnstone goalkeeper Alan Mannus fumbled Ryan Dow's shot into the net in 22 minutes.
United finished the match with 10 men after Coll Donaldson denied Chris Kane an obvious goal-scoring opportunity.
Murray Davidson hit the bar for Saints, but United held on for what could turn out to be an important three points.

The performance from United should also give their manager Mixu Paatelainen renewed hope that they can still pull off a great escape from relegation, as they narrow the gap on second-bottom Kilmarnock to five points. They also have a game in hand.
United sprung a surprise at the start of the game as they opted for a back four, rather than the three-man defence that has been their norm for several months.
The visitors also had the better of the early stages and should have scored after 40 seconds as Dow used his pace to get in behind the St Johnstone defence. His cross found John Rankin in the penalty area but his first touch let him down and the chance was gone.
In the 18th minute Mannus saved superbly to keep out Donaldson's header from Paton's free-kick. A minute later Mannus was in action again, this time saving Henri Anier's shot with his legs.
But Mannus would go from hero to zero as his slip gave Dundee United a deserved lead on the balance of play. The keeper looked to have saved a weak effort from Dow, but then somehow he managed to fumble it over his own goal line.
In the 35th minute Rankin then drove through the centre of the St Johnstone defence, the ball cannoned off his shins and just wide of the post.
United were by far the better side but just before half-time St Johnstone almost equalised. From a corner Davidson headed towards goal but his effort was blocked by his own player, Steven MacLean.
With an hour played, Donaldson hauled down Kane, denying the Saints striker an obvious goal-scoring opportunity. Referee Willie Collum immediately showed the red card.
St Johnstone pressed and Davidson's effort from 10 yards came back off the bar.
There was then an almighty stramash in the penalty area following a Dundee United corner which eventually led to a shot from Gavin Gunning from five yards out, but the defender blazed high and wide.
The match became increasingly tense and spiky but United held on for what could turn out to be a massive victory in the story of this season.
