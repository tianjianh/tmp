Firefighters found Billy trapped in water and reeds up to his back in the canal in Wednesbury on Thursday afternoon.
West Midlands Fire Service tweeted that crews fed him bread and carrots while they cleared the area to reach him and get him out.
He was successfully retrieved from the bog at about 15:30 BST and was checked over by the RSPCA.
"Other than being cold and hungry, he has no lasting injuries," a spokesman said.
