Prosecutor Phil Howes told Lincoln Crown Court: "[Thomas] was trying to evade a police pursuit on the A158 Horncastle to Skegness road, and because of his excessive speed he lost control at Hagworthingham.
"It caused significant damage to his car which collided with a tree and there were significant injuries to his two passengers."
He said the officer involved in the pursuit estimated that at one point he was travelling at 100mph and Thomas seemed to be still pulling away.
The court heard Thomas had sustained a serious brain injury in the crash.
His barrister Andrew Vout said his client is due to undergo an operation to insert a plate over his brain and needs therapy for slow speech and poor balance.
Sentencing Thomas, Recorder Paul Mann QC, said: "Having seen the photos of the wreckage, it is a wonder any of you survived."
Thomas, of Scott Drive, Somercotes, Alfreton, pleaded guilty to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.
He was also banned from driving for two and half years and ordered to take an extended driving test.
