[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
Residents in Suffolk are to see an increase in their council tax to cover policing costs.

Police and Crime Commissioner Tim Passmore's proposed 1.972% rise in the police precept from April was backed by the police and crime panel.
Mr Passmore said the extra £830,000 would help Suffolk Police cope with cuts to its budget.
He said the force had to save £6.76m over the next four years, with £2.6m of savings yet to be identified.
One area unlikely to be affected by the cuts is the cybercrime unit, which was set up in August 2015 and will have £584,000 invested in it next year.
The police and crime panel heard details of cybercrime investigations resulting in eight convictions.
One case involved a sacked taxi driver who hacked into his former employer's computer system and sabotaged the system used to deploy vehicles.
The defendant continued to access the computer systems remotely after he left the Waveney business. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a 16-month suspended prison sentence.
Police found that the defendant had removed tariffs from the taxi company's system so drivers could not log on to the system.
He also changed the business telephone number and website so it diverted to a rival firm, and uploaded offensive material.
He was given a five-year restraining order not to contact two individuals at the company, 250 hours of unpaid work and was ordered to pay £1,000 compensation to the victim.
Other investigations led by the cybercrime unit included the theft of £1m in cash from a Suffolk business in cyber-enabled fraud.
The unit has also investigated credit card fraud and harassment.
The report said there was a trend of "romance frauds" via online dating sites.
Mr Passmore said the rise in council tax would also help fund police pensions and apprenticeships.
