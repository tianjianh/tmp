The Spitfires lost 1-0 to Macclesfield on Tuesday to drop to 15th place and go seven games without a league win.
Allen joined Eastleigh from Barnet on 1 December, but won just two of his matches and leaves the club searching for a fourth manager of the season.
The 51-year-old failed to win a single home game and admitted after the National League loss to Macclesfield that he "was not enjoying it".
Allen, who guided Barnet to the National League title in 2015, becomes the third manager to depart this campaign after Chris Todd and Ronnie Moore.
His brief stint at the south coast side, which lasted just 84 days, saw 19 players move on from the club and 13 more brought in.
Following Tuesday's third straight league defeat which left them nine points above the relegation zone, Allen criticised his players.
"I've stood back and watched some games here, watched our team play and it's been awful, nowhere near good enough," he told BBC Radio Solent.
"It's not acceptable to me; it's not acceptable to the chairman.
"I've had two clubs win championships, with Gillingham and at Barnet, and it's been through hard work, desire and everybody in the team competing week in, week out. I'm not getting that here at the moment and I'm not enjoying it.
"I haven't got the vibe. I love the place, I love working with the chairman, I love the atmosphere when the crowd do get behind the players, but the players haven't given the crowd anything to lift them."
