The man, who is in his 20s, was hit by the sofa, thought to have fallen from a building which houses the W Hotel in Wardour Street on Friday.
He was taken to hospital by air ambulance, where he remains in a critical condition.
The hotel said it is working with the Met and the Health and Safety Executive to find out what happened.
A police spokesman said it was thought the sofa fell from overhead scaffolding, which had been erected as part of ongoing work at the Swiss Centre, which houses the W Hotel and a number of private residences.
A hotel spokeswoman said it was aware of the incident and would assist authorities in their investigations.
She added: "Our thoughts and prayers are go to the gentleman concerned."
A spokeswoman for Frank Knight, which manages the building's private residences, said the company would cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation.
