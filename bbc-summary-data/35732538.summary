Ball, 24, limped off towards the end of the Pro12 game at Parc y Scarlets, a week before Wales face England in the Six Nations at Twickenham.
"Jake took a knock to the knee at the stage when we scored the try," Scarlets head coach Wayne Pivac said.
"It was sensible to get him off as well."
Pivac added: "I think he'll be all right - he's thrown a bit of ice so we'll see what the medical boys say."
Wales coach Warren Gatland released lock Ball and scrum-half Aled Davies to the region as the Welsh squad prepare for their Six Nations showdown with England on 12 March.

Pivac also revealed Davies, 23, had been struggling with a virus while Scotland forward John Barclay also suffered an injury during the victory over bottom side Treviso.
"John just took a stinger and felt he was favouring one side so he was going to let the team down so it was the right decision and he came off but I'm pretty sure he'll be OK," Pivac added.
"Aled Davies was crook for the last couple of days with a virus and had to get through the warm-up. He did that and started so he was always going to run out of petrol.
"It was a matter of how long he'd last and he did well to get to where he did."
