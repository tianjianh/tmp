Quick Response (QR) codes on headstones and memorials have been given approved by Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge Town Council.
When scanned, the codes launch an online biography, images and videos of the deceased on a smartphone or tablet.
Town clerk Denise Emery, said a 2in (5cm) square QR code on the back of a gravestone "wouldn't be obtrusive".
The authority's burial committee has voted to allow the codes on memorials at Highbridge Cemetery, Burnham-on-Sea Cemetery and Brent Knoll Churchyard.
"People are using more modern machinery and want to be able to tap into information using that machinery and it certainly gives them an opportunity to make a web page and to remember their loved ones that way," said Ms Emery.
"Anything that helps them get through a very difficult period is going to be useful.
"How well it will be taken up, is another matter but it will be interesting to see how much interest is out there."
