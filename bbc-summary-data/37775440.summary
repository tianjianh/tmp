Paula Hooper, 52, struck the masked man on the arm when he demanded money from the till at Ely Post Office at about 08:30 BST on Tuesday.
CCTV footage then shows her chasing him out of the shop from behind the counter.
Ms Hooper said she thought it was a "Halloween joke" when she saw the red devil mask.
"I then saw the big kitchen knife he was waving and he demanded I open the till, threatening me with a lot of swearing," she said.
"I screamed and didn't think twice but sounded the alarm and grabbed the baseball bat which we always keep handy for something like this.
"I caught him on the arm and he just turned and I chased him out of the shop."
Postmaster Shady Taha, who was in his office at the time of the incident, described Ms Hooper as the "hero of the day".
South Wales Police called her "a brave woman" and launched an appeal to find the man.
