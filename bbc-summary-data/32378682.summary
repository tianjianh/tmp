The man was taken into custody at 21:20 BST on Saturday, an hour before his Cathay Pacific flight from Heathrow Airport was due to take off.
Police said weapons were discovered during a search of flight crew staff.
The man, who is believed to be 61, was taken to a local police station and has been bailed until next month.
There was no relief crew so passengers had to wait until Sunday to complete their journey.
A Met Police spokesman said the man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon in a public place and possession of a knife blade or sharp pointed article in a public place.
The Met said "some knives" were seized and officers at Heathrow Airport were investigating the incident.
A Cathay Pacific spokeswoman said: "We apologise for the delay and inconvenience caused to the 262 passengers booked on CX254.
"The airline assisted passengers with overnight accommodation and alternative flight arrangements."
The company added that the Boeing 777 flight had departed at 14:47 BST on Sunday and arrived in Hong Kong at 09:31 BST on Monday.
