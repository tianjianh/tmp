Edinburgh fashion exhibition marks Queen's 90th birthday

[SN]FIRST-SENTENCE[SN]
The largest exhibition of the Queen's clothes and accessories ever shown in Scotland has opened at the Palace of Holyroodhouse for her 90th birthday.

[SN]RESTBODY[SN]
The display has been selected to cover the Queen's life and reign, and includes both evening and day wear.
The exhibition is one of three entitled Fashioning a Reign: 90 Years of Style from The Queen's Wardrobe.
A centrepiece is the outfit she wore for the official opening of the Scottish Parliament on 1 July 1999.
Sandra Murray designed the green silk-crepe and lace dress and purple coat, made of a silk-wool blend, which  the Queen wore as the Duke of Hamilton presented her with a Scottish crown in front of the 129-member strong assembly.
A shawl of purple and green Isle of Skye tartan, woven on the Isle of Lewis, and a hat by milliner Philip Somerville, completed her look.
Exhibitions at Buckingham Palace from 23 July and at Windsor Castle from 17 September will follow.
In total, more than 150 outfits worn by the Queen will be presented across the three sites, many chosen because of their close association with the location.
British couturier Sir Norman Hartnell, who first worked for the then Princess Elizabeth in the 1940s, produced many evening dresses in her wardrobe.
Among the dozens of outfits on display will be a turquoise-blue dress with a matching bolero jacket the Queen wore at the wedding of her sister Princess Margaret and Antony Armstrong-Jones in May 1960.
It is similar to a Hartnell evening gown she wore in 1962 for a gala performance of Rob Roy at the Royal Lyceum during the state visit to Scotland of King Olav of Norway.
The exhibition at Buckingham Palace will present outfits worn from the 1920s to the 2010s, from ceremonial and military attire to ensembles worn at family celebrations such as weddings and christenings.
The Windsor Castle event will bring together outfits ranging from evening gowns and elegant day wear to fancy-dress costumes worn by the young Princess Elizabeth for wartime family pantomimes.
