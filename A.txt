 normal prompt →  Model → x_n (one token logit)
“Be careful about you reasoning, pay attention…” + normal prompt → Model → x_c (one token logit)


Q1 ) What happens when we move from x_n to x_c?

Q2 ) fine tuning data set = D= {z_1, …, z_N} , where z_i  = (q_i, a_i)
Generate a new dataset: D’ = {z_1’, …, z_N’} After adding the “Be careful” to every data entry q_i.

Add a regularizer |M(q_i) - M(q’_i)|, play with regularizer


Q3) Observation : Talk in last neurips. After fine-tuning LLMs seem to behave lineary in the weight space. 
W = pretrained model
W1 = fine tuned for solving math equations
\delta W1 = W1 - W 
W2 = fine-tuned for chess
\delta W2 = W2 - W 

W’ = W + delta W1 + \delta W2 → able to solve both math and chess 

Task → Find the paper

===============
This can be done on top of Q2.

W* = fine tuned model
W’ = fine tuned with “careful” prompting

Use the weight W’’ = (1+alpha) W’ - alpha W*

W* – W’ — W’’

================







Q1:

Ideal case:

Q → A = [a1, a2, a3, .., an]
Q + be careful → A’ = [a’_1, a’_2, a’_3, …, a’_m]

k= min(m,n)

a’’_l =a’_l + \alpha * (a’_l - a_l)
1<=l<=k


===
Regular decoding
Q→a1
Q+be careful →a1’

Q+a1 →a2
Q+be careful + a1’-->a2’
=== 

Regular decoding
Q→a1
Q+be careful →a1’
a1’’ = a1’ + alpha * (a1’-a1)

Q+a1’’ →a2
Q+be careful + a1’’-->a2’
a2’’ = a2’ + alpha * (a2’-a2)
==========
A = [8:30 is the time for me to go to school now]
A’ = [I have to go to school at 9:00]
